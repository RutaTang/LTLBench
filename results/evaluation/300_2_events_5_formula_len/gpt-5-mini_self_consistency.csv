Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C1 holds or C4 holds"") is True or False given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — examine the context and consequences
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → event2 occurs next.
- After event2, event1 must happen → event1 occurs next.
- These rules force an alternating sequence: event1, event2, event1, event2, ... so event2 occurs repeatedly (infinitely often after the start).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Given the enforced alternation, event2 does occur repeatedly. (Even if one quibbles about the phrasing ""always"", event2 certainly occurs whenever required by the rules.)
- C2 and C3 are the same statement as C1.
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" Since C2 and C3 are identical statements, the implication C2 → C3 is tautologically true (if the same proposition holds then it implies itself; if it doesn't hold the implication is vacuously true). So C4 is True regardless.
- C5: ""C1 holds or C4 holds."" Because C4 is True, the disjunction C1 ∨ C4 is True regardless of C1.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C5 (""C1 holds or C4 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context and conditions
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- Thus starting from the initial event1, the events alternate: event2 happens, then event1, then event2, and so on indefinitely.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" From the alternating sequence, event2 occurs repeatedly (in every cycle). So C1 is true in the sense that event2 will keep occurring after the initial event1.
- C2 and C3 are the same as C1, so they are true as well.
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" Since C2 and C3 are identical true statements, the implication C2 → C3 is true (P → P is true).

Step 4 — evaluate C5
- C5 is ""C1 holds or C4 holds."" We have shown C1 is true (and C4 is also true), so the disjunction C1 ∨ C4 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Identify goal: decide whether C5 (C1 holds or C4 holds) is true.

Examine conditions:
- C1, C2, C3 each assert the same proposition: ""Event2 always happens.""
- C4 says ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" Since C2 and C3 are identical propositions, C4 is of the form (p → p), which is a tautology and thus true regardless of whether p is true or false.
- C5 is C1 ∨ C4. Because C4 is true, the disjunction C1 ∨ C4 is true regardless of C1.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Identify the question
We must decide whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — Understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened (so at the initial state event1 occurs).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so in the next state and thereafter, no events occur).
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant because event2 never occurs here).

Step 3 — Evaluate each condition at the initial state
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" At the initial state this is false because event1 did happen.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" In the next state no events occur (because event1 already happened), so ""Event1 does not happen"" is true in the next state. Thus C2 is true.
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" At the initial state event1 happens, and C2 is also true, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is true, C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" C4 is false, so ""C4 does not hold"" is true.

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — identify the goal
- We must determine the truth of C5 (""C4 does not hold"").

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" But the context says initially event1 happened, so C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Irrelevant because C3 already contains ""Event1 happens"" (see next).
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" Since event1 happens initially, C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This is the negation of C3, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" This is the negation of C4, so C5 is true.

Conclusion
- True
---
Step 1 — identify what's given:
- Initially, event1 happened. So ""event1 happens"" is true in the initial situation.
- (The other context facts are not needed for the present chain.)

Step 2 — evaluate conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This contradicts the given initial fact, so C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Whether C2 is true is irrelevant to the final question, because C3 can already be evaluated from the fact that event1 happens.
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" Since event1 happens, C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" C3 holds, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Because C4 is false, the statement ""C4 does not hold"" is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
You are asking whether C4 (""If C2 holds, then C3 holds"") is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step-by-step:

1. From the context, event2 happened initially, so ""event2 eventually happens"" (C1) is true.

2. C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Since C1 is already true, the implication C2 is true (an implication with a true consequent is true).

3. C3 is the same statement as C2, so C3 is also true.

4. C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" C2 is true and C3 is true, so the implication C4 is true (and in fact C2 and C3 are identical, so C4 holds generally).

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""If C2 holds, then C3 holds"") is true or false given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event2 happens.
- After any event2, event1 must happen.
- After any event1, event2 must happen.
Thus event2 does occur (initially) and continues to occur (they alternate), so event2 eventually happens.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True (holds in the given context).
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Since C1 is true, the implication C2 is true (an implication with a true consequent is true).
- C3: same as C2, so C3 is also true.
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" Because C2 and C3 are both true (indeed they are the same statement), the implication C4 is true.

Final answer
True
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked:
C4 is the statement “If C2 holds, then C3 holds.” We must decide whether C4 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions from the context:
- Context: event2 happens initially, and thereafter event1 and event2 alternate; in particular event2 does happen (now and repeatedly).
- C1: “Event2 eventually happens.” Given event2 occurs initially, C1 is true.
- C2: “If event2 happens, then C1 holds.” Since C1 is true unconditionally, this implication is true (an implication with a true consequent is true).
- C3: identical to C2, so C3 is also true.
  
Step 3 — evaluate C4:
- C4: “If C2 holds, then C3 holds.” C2 and C3 are the same statement and both hold, so the implication C2 → C3 is true (and any statement implies itself).

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
You are asked whether C4 (""If C2 holds, then C3 holds"", i.e. C2 → C3) is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1 = event1 ∨ event2.
- C2 = C1 ∨ event1. Since C1 already contains event1, C2 is equivalent to C1 ∨ event1 ≡ C1 (or more simply ≡ event1 ∨ event2).
- C3 = C1 ∨ event1, which is identical to C2.
- C4 is the implication C2 → C3.

Step 3 — use the context
Context states event1 happened initially (so event1 is true). That alone makes C1 true (and therefore C2 and C3 true). Moreover, C2 and C3 are logically identical in all cases, so C2 → C3 is a tautology.

Step 4 — conclusion
C4 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""If C2 holds, then C3 holds"") is true given the context and the definitions of C1–C3.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- Context: initially event1 happened; after event1 no other events can happen; after event2, event1 must happen.
- C1: event1 happens or event2 happens.
- C2: C1 holds or event1 happens.
- C3: C1 holds or event1 happens.
- C4: If C2 holds, then C3 holds.

Step 3 — reasoning
- C2 and C3 are syntactically identical: both are ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" Thus they always have the same truth value in any model.
- More concretely, from the context event1 did happen initially, so C1 is true (because event1 happens). Hence both C2 and C3 are true in the given context, so C2 → C3 holds.
- Even without using the context, any proposition implies itself, so C2 → C3 is a tautology here.

Conclusion
- True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""If C2 holds, then C3 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand each condition
- C1 = (event1 ∨ event2).
- C2 = (C1 ∨ event1) = (event1 ∨ event2 ∨ event1) = (event1 ∨ event2). So C2 ≡ C1.
- C3 = (C1 ∨ event1) — identical to C2, so C3 ≡ (event1 ∨ event2). Thus C2 ≡ C3.

Step 3 — use the context
- The context says event1 happened initially, so event1 is true. That already makes C1 (and hence C2 and C3) true. Regardless, C2 and C3 are the same formula.

Step 4 — evaluate C4
- Since C2 and C3 are logically equivalent, the implication C2 → C3 is always true (A → A is true). With event1 true, both antecedent and consequent are true, so the implication holds.

Sample responses:
Identify the question
- The hypothesis asks whether C5 (""If event2 happens, then C4 holds"") is true given the context and the other conditions.

Examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p) and therefore true.
- C2: same as C1, also a tautology and true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 is true immediately (a tautology), it certainly holds now and thus “eventually” holds. So C3 is true.
- C4: ""C1 holds and C3 holds."" Both are true, so C4 is true.

Reason about C5
- C5 is ""If event2 happens, then C4 holds."" C4 is true unconditionally (independent of whether event2 happens), so the implication (event2 → C4) is true. (Even without that, in the given context event2 does happen initially, and C4 still holds.)

Final answer
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C5 is the statement ""If event2 happens, then C4 holds."" We must decide whether C5 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (and, in the context, event2 does happen initially), so C1 holds.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 holds.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 already holds (now and always), C3 holds.
- C4: ""C1 holds and C3 holds."" Both are true, so C4 holds.

Step 3 — evaluate C5
- C5: ""If event2 happens, then C4 holds."" C4 is true unconditionally, so the implication is true (and in the actual run event2 does happen anyway). Therefore C5 holds.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
We must decide whether C5 (""If event2 happens, then C4 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" — a tautology (always true).
- C2: same as C1 — also a tautology (always true).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 is always true, it certainly holds at some time (indeed at all times), so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C1 holds and C3 holds."" Both parts hold, so C4 is true unconditionally.
- C5: ""If event2 happens, then C4 holds."" Because C4 is already true regardless of whether event2 occurs, the implication is true whenever event2 happens (and in fact true even if event2 does not happen).

Step 3 — trace events to confirm consistency
The context (event2 then event1 then stop) does not contradict any of the above; it only reinforces that event2 does happen, but C4 is independent of that occurrence.

Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""If C4 holds, then event1 happens"") follows (is true) given the context.

Step 2 — restate the conditions
- Context:
  - Initially event1 happened (so event1 happens at least once).
  - After event2, event1 must happen (whenever event2 occurs, event1 will occur afterward).
  - After event1, event2 must happen (whenever event1 occurs, event2 will occur afterward).
- Hypothesis pieces:
  - C1: Event1 always happens.
  - C2: Event1 always happens. (same as C1)
  - C3: C1 and C2 (so C3 ≡ ""Event1 always happens"")
  - C4: C3 or event2 happens (so C4 is true iff either event1 always happens, or event2 happens)
  - C5: If C4 holds, then event1 happens (C4 → event1)

Step 3 — analyze when C4 can be true and whether event1 then happens
- Case A: C3 holds. Then by C3, event1 always happens, so event1 happens. Thus C4 → event1 holds in this case.
- Case B: C3 does not hold, but C4 holds because ""event2 happens"" is true. If event2 happens, the context guarantees that event1 must happen afterward. So event1 happens. Thus C4 → event1 holds in this case as well.
- If C4 is false, the implication C4 → event1 is vacuously true.

Step 4 — conclusion
- In every possible situation permitted by the context, whenever C4 is true, event1 happens. Therefore C5 is True.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Task: decide whether C5 (""If C4 holds, then event1 happens"") follows from the context.

- Interpret the context:
  - Initially event1 happens.
  - After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur following any event1).
  - After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur following any event2).
  - Thus event1 and event2 alternate; whenever event2 occurs, event1 will subsequently occur.

- Examine the hypothesis pieces:
  - C1 and C2 each state ""Event1 always happens."" Whether these are true or false does not break the forthcoming argument, but if they were true they would certainly imply event1.
  - C3 = C1 and C2. If C3 is true then event1 holds (since both C1 and C2 assert event1 always happens).
  - C4 = C3 or event2. So C4 can be true either because C3 holds or because event2 happens.
    - If C4 holds because C3 holds, then event1 holds (by C3).
    - If C4 holds because event2 happens, then by the context ""after event2, event1 must happen"" so event1 will occur.

- In all possible ways C4 can be true, event1 follows. Therefore the implication in C5 is satisfied. Hence C5 is True."

First, what is being asked:
- We must decide whether C5 (""If C4 holds, then event2 happens."") is True or False given the scenario and the definitions of C1–C4.

Examine the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is equivalent to simply asserting event2 happens (redundant conjunct).
- C2: same as C1, so C2 also asserts event2 happens.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" So C3 says: in the next state, event2 happens.
- C4: ""C1 holds and C3 holds."" So C4 requires that event2 happens now (by C1) and event2 holds in the next state (by C3).
- C5: ""If C4 holds, then event2 happens."" That is, C4 => event2.

Reasoning:
- C1 already asserts event2. Therefore any state satisfying C4 (which requires C1) already has event2 true in that state. So C4 => event2 holds directly.
- Even if C4 were impossible under the scenario (indeed C3 requires event2 after event2, which the scenario forbids, so C4 may be unsatisfiable), an implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true. So either way, the implication C5 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether the statement C5 (""If C4 holds, then event2 happens"") is true or false given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is just a redundant conjunction; it entails that event2 happens.
- C2: same as C1, so it also entails event2.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" (says that event2 holds in the next state)
- C4: ""C1 holds and C3 holds."" So C4 includes C1 as a conjunct, hence if C4 holds then event2 holds (by the C1 part).

Step 3 — reason about C5
- C5 is the implication ""If C4 holds, then event2 happens.""
- Because C4 contains C1, and C1 directly asserts event2, C4 ⇒ event2. Therefore the implication in C5 is true whenever C4 holds.
- (As an additional note: under the given event constraints C4 is actually impossible to realize in a run, but even if it never holds, the implication would be vacuously true. Either way C5 is true.)

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C5 (""If C4 holds, then event2 happens"") is true given the context constraints.

Step 2 — restate the context
- s0 (initial): event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → there is a next state s1 where event2 happens.
- After event2, no further events can happen → s1 is terminal (no s2).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions in the relevant states (take s0 as the current state)
- C1: ""event2 happens and event2 happens"" ≡ event2. At s0, event2 does not happen, so C1 is false at s0.
- C2: same as C1, so false at s0.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" The next state s1 does have event2, so C2 is true in s1; therefore C3 is true at s0.
- C4: C1 ∧ C3 = false ∧ true = false at s0.
- C5: ""If C4 holds, then event2 happens."" At s0 the antecedent C4 is false, so the implication is vacuously true at s0.

Check other state s1 briefly:
- At s1, C1 and C2 are true (event2 holds), but C3 (""C2 in the next state"") is false because there is no next state; hence C4 = true ∧ false = false at s1. So C4 never holds in any reachable state.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Because C4 never holds, the implication C4 → event2 is always true (vacuously). Therefore C5 is True.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — What is being asked
- We must decide the truth of C5 (""C4 holds or event1 happens"") given the context and the definitions C1–C4.

Step 2 — Interpret the context and timeline
- Initially (state S0) event1 happened (so event1 is true at S0).
- After event1, event2 must happen at some subsequent state; take the next state S1 where event2 happens.
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen, so S1 is terminal (no further states).

Step 3 — Understand the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — equivalent to simply ""event2 happens"" (true exactly at states where event2 holds).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e. C1 must hold at every state (globally). This requires event2 to hold at all states.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens"" — C2 → event1.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — Next(C3); we evaluate C3 at S1.
- C5: ""C4 holds or event1 happens"" — C4 ∨ event1 (evaluated at the initial state S0).

Step 4 — Evaluate each condition on the timeline
- At S0: event1 is true, event2 is false, so C1 is false at S0.
- C2 (always C1) is false, because C1 is not true at S0 (so it cannot be true at all states).
- C3 is the implication C2 → event1. Since C2 is false, the implication is true (vacuously true). Also event1 is true at S0 anyway, so C3 holds at S0.
- C4 is Next(C3): we need C3 at S1. At S1, event2 is true, but C2 is still false (because C1 failed at S0), so C3 at S1 is also true (again vacuously or because implication antecedent is false). Thus C4 holds at S0.
- C5 = C4 ∨ event1 at S0. We have C4 true and event1 true at S0, so the disjunction is true.

Final answer
True
---
Step 1 — set up the timeline from the context
- t0: initially event1 happens.
- t1: after event1, event2 must happen → event2 happens at t1.
- t2 and later: after event2 no other events can happen → no events occur at t2, t3, ...

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""event2 happens and event2 happens"" — equivalently: event2 holds at the current time.
  - C1 is false at t0, true at t1, false at t2 and later.
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e. C1 holds at all times from the evaluation point).
  - At t0 this is false (C1 is false at t0 and at later times), so C2 is false at t0.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" 
  - At t0 the antecedent C2 is false, so the implication is true (vacuously). Thus C3 is true at t0.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" We check C3 at t1.
  - At t1, C2 (""always C1"" from t1 onward) is false (C1 does not hold at all future times), so the antecedent is false and C3 is true at t1. Therefore C4 is true at t0.
- C5: ""C4 holds or event1 happens.""
  - At t0, C4 holds, so the disjunction is true.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Timeline from the context: state0 (initial) has event1; by ""after event1, event2 must happen"" the next state (state1) has event2; after event2 no further events occur.
- C1 = ""event2 and event2"" reduces to ""event2"". It is true at state1 (false at state0).
- C2 = ""always C1"" is false (C1 does not hold in every state).
- C3 = ""if C2 then event1"" is therefore vacuously true (the antecedent C2 is false).
- C4 = ""C3 holds in the next state"": at state0 the next state is state1, and C3 is true there, so C4 is true at state0.
- C5 = ""C4 or event1"": at the initial state state0 both C4 and event1 are true (at least one is true), so C5 is true."

Sample responses:
We are being asked whether C5 (""If C4 holds, then event1 happens"") is true given the context and the definitions of the Ci.

Step-by-step:

- Identify the goal: decide truth of C5.
- Examine definitions:
  - C4 is defined as ""Event1 happens and C3 holds"" (i.e., C4 ≡ event1 ∧ C3).
  - C5 is ""If C4 holds, then event1 happens"" (i.e., C4 ⇒ event1).
- Logical reasoning:
  - From the definition C4 ≡ (event1 ∧ C3), whenever C4 is true, event1 is one of the conjuncts and therefore must be true. Thus C4 implies event1 by construction.
  - Even if C4 is false, the implication C4 ⇒ event1 is still true (an implication with a false antecedent is true). So in all cases C5 holds.
- The context about when events can occur and that event2 initially happened is irrelevant to the logical implication C4 ⇒ event1, because C4 already contains event1.

Final answer:
True

We ask whether C5 (""If C4 holds, then event1 happens"") is true or false given the context.

Step-by-step reasoning
1. Context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. Therefore event2 has already occurred and no further events (including event1) can occur.
2. C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True (it already happened initially).
3. C2: same as C1, so True.
4. C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds."" True.
5. C4: ""Event1 happens and C3 holds."" False, because event1 does not happen.
6. C5: ""If C4 holds, then event1 happens."" This is logically valid: C4 explicitly includes ""Event1 happens,"" so C4 ⇒ event1 is a tautology. Also, in the actual situation C4 is false, making the implication vacuously true.

Final answer:
True

What is being asked
- Determine whether C5 (""If C4 holds, then event1 happens"") is true or false given the context and the conditions C1–C4.

Examine the conditions
- Context: Initially event2 happened. After event1, no other events can happen. After event2, no other events can happen.
- C1: Event2 eventually happens. True (event2 happened initially).
- C2: Event2 eventually happens. True (same as C1).
- C3: C1 holds or C2 holds. True (both hold).
- C4: Event1 happens and C3 holds. This requires event1 to happen. Given event2 happened initially and no events can occur after event2, event1 does not occur in the scenario; so C4 does not hold (it’s false).

Reason about C5
- C4 is defined as (event1 happens) AND (C3). Thus the implication ""If C4 holds, then event1 happens"" is logically valid by construction: whenever C4 is true, event1 must be true. Even if C4 is actually false in the scenario, the implication is still true (vacuously true).

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
First, what is being asked: C5 is ""C4 eventually holds."" We must determine whether C5 is true given the context.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Context facts:
   - Initially, event1 happened.
   - After event1, no other events can happen.
   - After event2, no other events can happen.
   So the execution starts with event1 and then no further events occur (the run is terminal after the initial occurrence of event1).

2. Evaluate C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens.""
   - True, because event1 happens initially.

3. Evaluate C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds.""
   - True (C1 holds, and event1 also holds).

4. Evaluate C3: ""C2 eventually holds.""
   - True, because C2 already holds now (so ""eventually"" is satisfied immediately).

5. Evaluate C4: ""C3 holds in the next state.""
   - This asks whether, in the immediate successor state, C3 is true. But after event1 no other events can happen and there is no nontrivial successor that can make a new truth value; in standard temporal semantics a next-state formula is false when no next state exists. Therefore C4 is false (there is no next state in which to evaluate C3).

6. Evaluate C5: ""C4 eventually holds.""
   - Since C4 is false now and there are no future states where C4 could become true, C5 is false.

Conclusion: C5 is False.
---
Step 1 — model the timeline
- Initially (time 0) event1 happens.
- After event1 no other events can happen, so there is no later state in which any new event (including event2) occurs. Effectively the trace has no next state with new events.

Step 2 — evaluate C1–C3 at the initial state
- C1: ""event1 happens or event2 happens"" — true at time 0 because event1 happens.
- C2: ""event1 happens or C1 holds"" — true at time 0 (both disjuncts true).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — true, because C2 already holds at time 0 (so it holds now and therefore eventually).

Step 3 — evaluate C4 and C5
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — requires a next state where C3 is true. There is no next state with events (after event1 nothing can happen), so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" — since C4 is false now and there is no future state where C4 can become true, C5 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 has occurred.
- After event1 happens, no further events can occur (so the initial state is terminal; there is no next state).
- (Also “after event2 no other events can happen,” but event2 never occurs here, so that clause is irrelevant.)

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions in the initial (and only) state
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" True, because event1 happened initially.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" True (both disjuncts are true).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" True — C2 already holds now, so it holds at some time (the present).
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" False — there is no next state (after event1 no other events can happen), and under standard next-state semantics Xφ is false when there is no successor state. So C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" Since C4 is false now and there are no future states in which it could become true, C5 is false.

Sample responses:
You are asking whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is true or false given the context.

Step 1 — understand the context:
- Initially event2 happened (so event2 does happen).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur after event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Step 2 — examine each condition:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This contradicts the context (event2 does happen), so C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" This requires both ""event2 does not happen"" and ""event2 happens"" simultaneously, a contradiction, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 is never true, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" C3 is false, so it cannot always hold; C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" This is the negation of C4; since C4 is false, C5 is true.

Final answer: True

We are asked whether C5 is True or False given the context.

Context summary:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Evaluate the conditions step by step:

1. C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""  
   Contradicted by the context (""Initially event2 happened""), so C1 is False.

2. C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens.""  
   This requires C1 to be True and event2 to happen. Since C1 is False, C2 is False (and in fact self-contradictory).

3. C3: ""C2 eventually holds.""  
   C2 is impossible, so it cannot ever hold; C3 is False.

4. C4: ""C3 always holds.""  
   Since C3 is False, C4 is False.

5. C5: ""C4 does not hold.""  
   This is the negation of C4. Because C4 is False, C5 is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is true or false given the scenario.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event2 has happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur after event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Thus the actual event sequence is: event2 (already happened) → event1 (must happen) → stop.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This contradicts the context (event2 did happen), so C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" C1 is false, so the conjunction is false; C2 is false. (Also internally contradictory: requires event2 both to not happen and to happen.)
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 is impossible (false now and cannot become true), C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" C3 is false, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is false, C5 is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — understand the statements:
- Context: event1 happens initially, and after event1 no other events can happen (so event1 occurs and cannot occur again).
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" — true in the given context (it happens initially).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" — asserts that at every point in time, C1 is true.
- C3: ""C1 always holds."" — identical to C2.
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" — an implication between C2 and C3.

Step 2 — reason about C4:
- C2 and C3 are the same statement. An implication of the form P → P is always true (a tautology) regardless of whether P itself is true or false.

Therefore C4 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C4 (""If C2 holds, then C3 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context and each condition
- Context: Initially event1 happened. After event1, no other events can happen. After event2, no other events can happen.
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Given the context, event1 happens initially, so C1 is true (there is an occurrence of event1).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" This means at every moment in time, it must be true that ""event1 will eventually happen in the future."" After the initial occurrence of event1 there are no further events, so at times after the initial moment there is no future occurrence of event1; hence C1 is false at those later times. Therefore C2 is false.
- C3: same as C2 (it repeats ""C1 always holds""), so C3 is also false.

Step 3 — evaluate C4 (""If C2 holds, then C3 holds"")
- C4 is the implication C2 → C3. Since C2 is false in the model, the implication C2 → C3 is vacuously true (an implication with a false antecedent is true). Also C2 and C3 are identical statements, so the implication is tautologically valid anyway.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" This is true in the given context because event1 happened initially.
- C2 and C3 are the same statement: ""C1 always holds.""
  - (Under standard temporal semantics this is actually false here, because after the initial occurrence there are no further events, so from times after the initial moment ""event1 eventually happens"" would not hold. But whether C2 is true or false does not matter for the implication below.)
- C4 is ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" Since C2 and C3 are identical, the implication C2 → C3 is a logical tautology (whenever C2 holds, C3 holds, and if C2 does not hold the implication is vacuously true).

Therefore C4 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — understand the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → therefore event2 happens (after the initial event1).
- After event2, event1 must happen → therefore event1 happens again, and this alternation continues. So both event1 and event2 do occur.

Step 2 — examine each condition:
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" Logically C1 ≡ (Event2 happens). Given the context, Event2 does happen, so C1 is True.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" Since C1 is equivalent to Event2, C2 ≡ (Event2 happens). Thus C2 is True.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" C2 is True, and event1 does happen (initially and repeatedly), so the implication is True. Hence C3 is True.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is True, C4 is False.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" C4 is False, so C5 = not False = True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify what’s asked
- We must decide whether C5 is True or False given the context and the conditions C1–C5.

Step 2 — restate the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen. (So event2 does happen following the initial event1.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (So whenever event2 happens, event1 follows.)

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — redundant; equivalent to ""event2 happens.""
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds"" — since C1 is ""event2 happens,"" C2 is also equivalent to ""event2 happens.""
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens"" — i.e. ""if event2 happens then event1 happens.""
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" — negation of C3.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" — negation of C4, so C5 is equivalent to C3.

Step 4 — trace the events and truth values
- From the context, initial event1 ⇒ event2 happens (by ""after event1, event2 must happen"").
- Therefore event2 happens is true, so C1 and C2 are true.
- The context also states ""after event2, event1 must happen,"" which is exactly the content of C3 (""if event2 happens then event1 happens""), so C3 is true.
- C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is false.
- C5 is the negation of C4, so C5 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Context: Initially event1 happened. Also ""after event1, event2 must happen"" and ""after event2, event1 must happen."" So starting from the initial event1, event2 will happen, and after that event1 will happen, and so on.
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is equivalent to ""Event2 happens."" From the context, event2 does indeed happen (because event1 happened and after event1 event2 must happen), so C1 holds.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" Since C1 is just ""event2 happens"", C2 reduces to ""event2 happens"", so C2 holds.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" C2 holding implies event2 happens; by the context rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"", event1 indeed happens. Thus C3 holds.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This asserts C3 is false, but we just showed C3 holds, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is false, ""C4 does not hold"" is true.

Therefore C5 is True."

Goal: determine truth of C5 (""If C3 holds, then C4 holds"") given the context.

1) Understand context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2 no other events can happen (so there is no successor state with any event after the initial state).

2) Interpret the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Since there is no next state after the initial event2, C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" With C1 false, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" There is only the initial state (no successors), and C2 is true there, so C2 holds in every state along the trace — C3 is true.
- C4: same as C1, so C4 is false.

3) Evaluate C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds.""
- Antecedent C3 is true, consequent C4 is false, so the implication is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Initially event2 has happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. (So once event2 has occurred, there is no future state in which any event, including event2, happens.)

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Given the context this is false (no events can happen after event2).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is true (negation of false).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since there are no future states with events after event2, C2 holds now and in all (nonexistent) future event-states, so C3 is true.
- C4: same as C1, so false.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" C3 is true while C4 is false, so the implication is false.

Final answer:
False
---
C5 is False.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- From the context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no events can happen. So there will never be an occurrence of event2 in any subsequent (next) state.
- C1 (""Event2 happens in the next state"") is therefore false.
- C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.
- C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true, because once event2 has occurred there are no further events, so in every (current or future) state it remains true that event2 does not happen in the next state.
- C4 is the same as C1, so C4 is false.
- C5 is the implication ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" That is true->false, which makes the implication false.

Thus C5 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Interpret the context
- Initially event1 has occurred.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Since event1 already occurred initially, no event (including event2) can occur at any later time.
- The rule ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 cannot occur (and even if it did, event1 would have to occur after it, but that would conflict with the “no events after event1” fact).

Step 2 — Evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" — False (event2 cannot happen given the context).
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" — True. An implication with a false antecedent is true; moreover, if event2 did happen then ""event2 eventually happens"" would also be true, so the implication holds in any case.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" — True (C2 is true, so the disjunction is true).
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" — False (since C3 is true).
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" — True (negation of a false statement is true).

Final answer: True
---
Goal: determine whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is True or False.

Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide the truth value of C5 given the context and the chain of conditions C1–C5.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Therefore event2 cannot happen at any time after the initial event1.
- So ""event2 eventually happens"" is false in this scenario.

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given the context, C1 is false.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" This is the implication (event2 → C1). Either read logically or temporally, this is vacuously true here: since event2 does not occur, the antecedent is false, so the implication is true. (Even if event2 did occur, C1 states ""event2 eventually happens"", which would then also be true; so the implication is true in all cases.)
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" C2 is true (see above), so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is true, C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is false, its negation is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must determine whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is true or false given the context and the other Ci statements.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Since event1 happened initially, no further events (including event2) can ever happen.
- Therefore event2 does not occur in any reachable future.

Step 3 — evaluate the Ci conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given the context, this is false (event2 never happens).
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Since event2 never happens, the antecedent is false, so C2 is vacuously true.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" C2 is true, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is true, C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" C4 is false, so C5 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C1, C2, C3 each assert: ""Event1 always happens.""
- C4 asserts: ""C2 holds or C3 holds"" — which is equivalent to ""Event1 always happens.""
- C5 asserts: ""C1 holds and C4 holds"" — which is again equivalent to ""Event1 always happens.""
So determining C5 reduces to deciding whether, given the context, event1 always happens.

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So in every possible execution/run the very first (initial) event is event1.
- After event1, no other events can happen. That makes any execution terminate immediately after that initial event; there are no further events in any run.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 can never occur (it would have to occur after event1, but no events can occur after event1). So that rule is vacuously satisfied.

Step 3 — conclude about ""always happens""
- In every possible execution permitted by the context, event1 occurs (it occurs initially). There is no execution in which event1 does not occur.
- Therefore the claim ""Event1 always happens"" is true under the given context. Hence C1, C2, C3, C4 are true, and so C5 (C1 and C4) is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C5 is the claim we must evaluate. C5 = C1 and C4, where C4 = C2 or C3. C1, C2, C3 are all the same statement: ""Event1 always happens."" So C4 is equivalent to ""Event1 always happens"" and C5 is equivalent to ""Event1 always happens"" (C1 ∧ (C1 ∨ C1) ≡ C1).

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event1 happened (so every run starts with event1 occurring).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once that initial event1 has occurred, no further events can occur in that run).
- There is a rule ""After event2, event1 must happen,"" but that is irrelevant because event2 cannot occur after the initial event1 (no events can occur after event1), and there is no earlier place for event2 to occur before the initial event1.

Step 3 — trace the possible executions
- Every possible execution begins with event1 and then has no further events. Therefore every execution contains event1 (at the start). There is no execution that lacks event1.

Step 4 — conclude
- Since every possible execution includes event1, the statement ""Event1 always happens"" (as used in C1–C3) holds. Hence C5 (which is equivalent to C1) is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C5 is ""C1 holds and C4 holds"". Each of C1, C2, C3 says ""Event1 always happens"". C4 is ""C2 holds or C3 holds"", so C4 is also equivalent to ""Event1 always happens"". So C5 is equivalent to ""Event1 always happens"".

Step 2 — understand the context
- ""Initially, event1 happened."" — event1 occurs at the start of every execution.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" — if event2 ever occurs, then event1 must occur after it.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" — event1 is terminal: once event1 has occurred, no further events can occur afterward.

Step 3 — reason about possible executions
- Because event1 has happened initially, we already have event1 in every execution (it is given as initial).
- Since event1 is terminal, no other events (including event2) can occur after that initial event1. The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is therefore irrelevant (vacuously satisfied) because event2 cannot occur after the initial event1.
- Thus every execution contains event1 (it happened initially), so the claim ""Event1 always happens"" is true.

Conclusion
- C5 is True."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen, so once event2 occurs the sequence ends.
- Therefore no event can occur after that initial event2; in particular event1 cannot occur at any time after the initial event2, and since event2 is initial it means event1 cannot occur at all.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" False (event1 cannot happen).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" C1 is false, event2 does happen, but the conjunction is false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" C2 is false, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" C3 is false, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 holds or event1 happens."" C4 is true, so the disjunction is true (regardless of event1).

Final answer:

---
Step 1 — parse the context:
- Initially, event2 has occurred.
- After any event1, event2 must occur.
- After event2, no other events can occur (event2 is terminal).

From ""initially event2 happened"" and ""after event2 no other events can happen"", the timeline has event2 and then nothing else — in particular, event1 never occurs.

Step 2 — examine each condition:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" This is false (event1 never occurs).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" C2 is false, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is false, C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 holds or event1 happens."" C4 is true, so the disjunction is true regardless of event1.

Final answer:

Step 1 — understand the context
- Initially event2 has happened (so the initial state already has event2).
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 2 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" This is false. Because event2 has already happened initially and no events can happen after event2, there is no requirement or possibility that event1 must occur in all executions.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" False, because C1 is false (even though event2 did happen).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" False, since C2 is false.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" True, because C3 is false.
- C5: ""C4 holds or event1 happens."" C4 holds (true), so C5 is true regardless of event1.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true or false given the conditions.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is just Event1 (redundant disjunction). So C1 ≡ E1.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" — that is E1 → C1. Since C1 ≡ E1, C2 is E1 → E1, a logical tautology (always true).
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — because C2 is a tautology, C3 is true.
- C4: ""Event2 happens or C3 holds"" — this is E2 ∨ C3. Since C3 is true, C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 always holds"" — because C3 always holds (so C4 is true at all times), C5 is true.

Step 3 — check interaction with the context
- The context (event2 initially happened and is terminal) does not force event1 to occur or contradict any step above. The tautological nature of C2 and the ""always"" claim for C3 make C4 and hence C5 hold regardless of whether event1 occurs.

Final answer
True
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
We must decide whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true given the context and the other conditions. Final answer must be True or False.

Step 2 — simplify and examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is just equivalent to ""Event1 happens"".
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Since C1 ≡ ""Event1 happens"", C2 is ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens"", which is a tautologically true implication (always true).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Because C2 is a tautology (true at every moment), C3 is true.
- C4: ""Event2 happens or C3 holds."" Since C3 holds, C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" Because C3 always holds, the disjunction in C4 is always true, so C4 always holds; hence C5 is true.

Step 3 — check consistency with the context
The context (initial event2, after event1 event2 must happen, after event2 no other events) does not contradict any of the above; C2 being a tautology and C3 being always true are independent of whether event1 or event2 actually occur. Therefore C5 is satisfied.

Final answer:
True
---
Goal: decide whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is True or False.

1) What the hypothesis asks
- It asks whether C5 is true given the listed claims and the context.

2) Simplify and examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" simplifies to ""Event1 happens"" (same disjunct twice).
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" becomes event1 → event1, which is a logical tautology (always true).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is a tautology, C3 is true: C2 does indeed hold at all times.
- C4: ""Event2 happens or C3 holds."" Because C3 holds (always true), the disjunction Event2 ∨ C3 is true at all times.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" Since C4 is true at all times (because C3 is always true), C5 is true.

3) Interaction with the context
- The context (initially event2 happened; event1 ⇒ event2; after event2 nothing else can happen) does not contradict the above reasoning. C2 was a tautology independent of whether event1 actually occurs; C3 therefore holds; that suffices to make C4 always true and so C5 true.

   - Initially, event2 happened (so in the initial state event2 is true).
   - After event2, no other events can happen — so the initial state is terminal (there is no next state).

3. Evaluate each condition:
   - C1 (Event2 always happens): On the only state of the trace (the initial terminal state) event2 is true. ""Always"" (i.e., globally) is satisfied on a one-state trace, so C1 is true.
   - C2 is the same as C1, so C2 is also true.
   - C3 (C2 holds in the next state): There is no next state (the state is terminal), so ""next C2"" is false.
   - C4 (C3 eventually holds): Since C3 is never true (there are no future states), C4 is false.

4. Combine for C5: C5 = C1 and C4. C1 is true but C4 is false, so C5 is false.

Therefore the final answer is False.
---
The hypothesis asks whether C5 (C1 ∧ C4) is true.

Interpretation/assumptions: ""always"" means globally true on the execution, and ""next"" (X) requires a next state (so Xφ is false if there is no successor). The context says event2 happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen — so the run contains the initial state with event2 and then terminates (no next state).

Step-by-step:
- C1 (Event2 always happens): true in this run because the only state that exists (the initial state) has event2, so the global ""always"" holds on the trace.
- C2 is the same as C1, so also true.
- C3 (C2 holds in the next state): false, because there is no next state after the initial event2, so ""in the next state"" fails.
- C4 (C3 eventually holds): false, since C3 is false now and there are no future states where it could become true.
- C5 = C1 ∧ C4: false because C4 is false (conjunction requires both true).

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning, step by step:

- Initial situation: event2 has happened in the initial state, and after event2 no other events can happen. So the system has a single state where event2 occurred and there are no successors.

- C1 (Event2 always happens): Interpreting ""always"" as ""holds at every state along the path"", this is true because the only state is the initial state and event2 holds there. (C2 is the same as C1, so it is also true.)

- C3 (C2 holds in the next state): This asserts C2 in the immediate successor state. There is no next state (no successors after event2), so ""next"" is false. Hence C3 is false.

- C4 (C3 eventually holds): Since C3 is false in the initial state and there are no future states in which C3 could become true, ""eventually C3"" is false.

- C5 (C1 holds and C4 holds): C1 is true but C4 is false, so the conjunction C5 is false.

Therefore C5 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s asked
C5 is the formula ""If C4 holds, then event1 happens."" We must evaluate whether C5 is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event2 has happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
Thus the system forces event1 to occur (immediately next) and then event2, alternating forever. In particular, event1 does eventually happen.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True (follows from the context).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" Since C1 is true, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" False (because C2 does hold).
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" C3 is false now and remains false (C1 is true globally), so C4 is false.
- C5: ""If C4 holds, then event1 happens."" This implication has a false antecedent (C4 is false), so it is vacuously true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — understand the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After any event1, event2 must happen (so event2 follows event1).
- After any event2, event1 must happen (so event1 follows event2).
From that we get the trace: state0: event2, state1: event1, state2: event2, state3: event1, … — events alternate forever.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True (event1 occurs at state1 and repeatedly thereafter).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" Since C1 is true, C2 is true (at every state).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" False (because C2 holds).
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" False (C3 is false in every state, so it does not hold in the next state).
- C5: ""If C4 holds, then event1 happens."" This is an implication whose antecedent C4 is false, so the implication is vacuously true.

Final answer:
True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. Hence once event2 has happened, event1 cannot happen later.
- Also after event1 no other events can happen (but that doesn't matter because event1 never happens here).

Step 2 — evaluate each condition:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Since event2 happened initially and no events can occur after it, event1 indeed never happens. So C1 is True.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is the negation of C1. Since C1 is True, C2 is False.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" This implication has a false antecedent (C2 is False), so C3 is vacuously True.
- C4: ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds."" Event2 did happen, and C3 is True, so C4 is True.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" C4 already holds now (at the initial point), so it certainly holds eventually. Therefore C5 is True.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify given facts:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. (So event1 cannot happen after event2.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (Not relevant because event1 never occurs.)

Step 2 — evaluate conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" True, because event2 happened and that prevents any other events (including event1).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is the negation of C1, so C2 is False.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C3 is True.
- C4: ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds."" Event2 does happen, and C3 is True, so C4 is True.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" C4 already holds, so C5 is True.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context: ""Initially, event2 happened"" and ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Therefore event1 does not happen (there is no time after the initial event2 when event1 can occur). So C1 (Event1 does not happen) is True.

2. C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" — the negation of C1. Since C1 is True, C2 is False.

3. C3 is ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C3 is True (vacuously).

4. C4 is ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds."" Event2 does happen (initially), and C3 holds, so C4 is True.

5. C5 is ""C4 eventually holds."" C4 already holds now, so the eventuality is satisfied. Hence C5 is True.

Therefore C5 is True."

Sample responses:
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. The question asks whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is true or false given the context.

2. From the context:
   - Initially event1 happened.
   - After event1, no other events can happen. (So there is no later state in which any event occurs.)
   - After event2, no other events can happen. (Event2 would also be terminal.)

3. Evaluate the conditions at the initial state:
   - C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" This is true initially because event1 happened.
   - C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" There is no next state after event1 (no further events can happen), so C2 is false.
   - C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" Since C2 is false and event2 does not happen (and cannot happen after event1), C3 is false.
   - C4: ""Event2 happens and C3 holds."" This requires event2 to happen and C3 true; both are false, so C4 is false.
   - C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Negation of false is true.

Therefore C5 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is asked:
C5 is ""C4 does not hold."" We must decide whether C5 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred, event2 cannot occur afterwards (event2 does not happen).
- (The clause about ""after event2, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never occurs.)

Step 3 — examine the conditions:
- C1: event1 happens or event2 happens. True initially because event1 happened.
- C2: C1 holds in the next state. After event1 no other events happen, so in the next state neither event1 nor event2 happens ⇒ C2 is false.
- C3: C2 holds or event2 happens. Both disjuncts are false (C2 is false and event2 does not happen) ⇒ C3 is false.
- C4: event2 happens and C3 holds. Since event2 does not happen, C4 is false (in fact C4 is equivalent to ""event2 happens"", because if event2 happens then C3 would be true via its second disjunct).
- C5: C4 does not hold. Since C4 is false, C5 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
We must determine whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context and each condition
- Context:
  - Initially, event1 happened.
  - After event1, no other events can happen.
  - After event2, no other events can happen.
  (So event1 occurs initially and both event1 and event2 are terminal: once one has happened, no further events occur.)
- Conditions:
  - C1: event1 happens or event2 happens.
  - C2: C1 holds in the next state.
  - C3: C2 holds or event2 happens.
  - C4: event2 happens and C3 holds.
  - C5: not C4.

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- Initially event1 happened, so C1 is true in the initial state (event1 ∨ event2 is true).
- Because event1 has happened and ""after event1 no other events can happen,"" no events occur in any later state. In particular, event2 never happens.
- Consider the next state: neither event1 nor event2 happens there (no events occur after the initial event1), so C1 is false in the next state. Therefore C2 is false.
- Since event2 never happens and C2 is false, C3 = (C2 ∨ event2) is false.
- C4 = (event2 ∧ C3) is false (event2 is false).
- Therefore C5 = not C4 is true.

Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C5 is true given the context. C5 is ""C4 eventually holds."" We'll evaluate the chain C1→C5 under the provided event rules.

Step 2 — model the situation
- There is an initial state s0 in which event1 happened.
- Rule: after event1, no other events can happen. So s0 has no successor states (the run ends at s0).
- The rule about event2 (""after event2, event1 must happen"") is irrelevant because event2 cannot occur (no events after event1).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions at s0
- C1 (""Event1 always happens""): In the only state (s0) event1 has happened, so C1 is true at s0.
- C2 (""C1 eventually holds"" = F C1): Since C1 holds already at s0, ""eventually C1"" is true at s0.
- C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"" = X C2): There is no next state after s0, so X C2 is false at s0.
- C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"" = X C3): Since C3 is false at s0 and there is no next state, X C3 is false at s0.
- C5 (""C4 eventually holds"" = F C4): There is no future state where C4 can hold (only s0 exists and C4 is false there), so F C4 is false at s0.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — What is asked:
We must decide whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is True or False given the context and the definitions of C1–C4.

Step 2 — Understand the context and each condition:
- Context: Initially event1 happened. After event1, no other events can happen. Also, after event2, no other events can happen.
- C1: Event2 does not happen.
- C2: If event1 happens, then C1 holds (i.e., if event1 happens then event2 does not happen).
- C3: Event2 happens and C2 holds.
- C4: C3 holds or event1 happens.
- C5: C4 always holds.

Step 3 — Reasoning about events:
- The context explicitly states event1 happened initially.
- Also, once event1 has happened, no other events can happen thereafter. Therefore event2 cannot occur at any time (it cannot happen after event1, and event1 already happened initially). So event2 does not happen.
- From that: C1 (""event2 does not happen"") is True.
- C2 (""if event1 happens then C1"") is True because event1 does happen and C1 is true.
- C3 (""event2 happens and C2"") is False because event2 does not happen.
- C4 (""C3 or event1"") is True because event1 does happen.
- Because no events can occur after the initial state, the situation cannot change; C4 is true initially and remains true at all times.

Step 4 — Conclusion:
C5 (""C4 always holds"") is True.
---
Step 1 — facts from the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has occurred, event2 cannot occur afterwards.)
- Also, after event2 no other events can happen (not needed here because event2 does not occur).

Step 2 — evaluate C1–C3
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Since event1 happened initially and no events can occur after it, event2 does not (and cannot) happen. So C1 is true.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Event1 does happen and C1 is true, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""Event2 happens and C2 holds."" This requires event2 to happen, but event2 does not happen, so C3 is false.

Step 3 — C4 and C5
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" Event1 does happen, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" C4 is true now, and no further events can change the facts (nothing can happen after event1), so C4 remains true at all times. Therefore C5 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify what’s asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true given the initial facts.

Step 2 — given facts / constraints
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Since event1 already happened and no events can happen after it, event2 cannot happen. So C1 is true.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Event1 does happen, and C1 is true, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""Event2 happens and C2 holds."" Event2 does not happen, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" C3 is false but event1 did happen, so C4 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C5 (""C4 always holds"")
- No further events can occur after the initial event1, so nothing can change the truth of C4. Since C4 is true initially and no event can make it false later, C4 holds at all times.
- Therefore C5 is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""If C2 holds, then C3 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context and the Ci
- Context:
  - Initially, event2 happened.
  - After event2, no other events can happen.
  - After event1, event2 must happen.
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds.""
- C3: same as C2.
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds.""

Step 3 — evaluate each condition in the given model
- From the context, event2 has already happened initially and no events can occur afterwards. So in the next state (after the initial state) event2 does not happen. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2 is an implication whose antecedent (""event2 happens"") is true (it did happen initially) but whose consequent C1 is false, so C2 is false.
- C3 is identical to C2, so C3 is also false.

Step 4 — evaluate C4
- C4 is the implication ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" Its antecedent (C2) is false, so the implication is true (a false antecedent makes the implication true in classical logic).

Final answer:
True
---
Goal: decide whether C4 (""If C2 holds, then C3 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Context summary:
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 is true now).
- After event2, no other events can happen (the state after event2 is terminal; no events occur there).
- After event1, event2 must happen (irrelevant here because event1 did not occur earlier).

Examine each condition:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Since after event2 no other events can happen, the next state does not have event2. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" In the current situation event2 does happen (initially), so the antecedent of C2 is true. Because C1 is false, the implication C2 is false.
- C3: identical to C2, so C3 is also false.
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously). Here C2 does not hold (C2 is false), so the antecedent of C4 is false, making C4 true regardless of C3.

Conclusion: True.
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 has happened.
- After event2 no other events can happen (so in the next state no events occur).
- After event1, event2 must happen (irrelevant here because event1 does not occur).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Given that event2 already happened initially and no events can happen after event2, event2 does not happen in the next state. So C1 is False.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" At the initial moment event2 does happen, but C1 is False, so this implication is False (true antecedent, false consequent).
- C3: same as C2, so C3 is also False.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened (so event1 is true at the initial moment).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so no events occur at any later state).
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant if event2 never occurs).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state.” Given event1 already happened initially and no further events occur, event1 does not happen in the next state. So C1 is false.
- C2: “If event2 happens, then C1 holds.” Event2 never happens (because event1 happened initially and blocks further events), so the antecedent is always false — C2 is vacuously true.
- C3: “If C2 holds, then event1 happens.” C2 holds (true), and event1 does happen (initially), so C3 is true.
- C4: same as C1, so C4 is false.

Step 3 — determine C5
- C5 is “If C3 holds, then C4 holds.” C3 is true and C4 is false, so the implication is false.

Final answer:
False

Step 1 — Interpret the context
- Initially, event1 has already happened.
- After event1 happens, no further events can occur (so nothing can happen in any later state).
- After event2 happens, no further events can occur (event2 would also be terminal).

Step 2 — Evaluate the claims
- C1 (Event1 happens in the next state): False. Because event1 already happened initially and no events can happen afterwards, event1 does not occur in the next state.
- C2 (If event2 happens, then C1 holds): True. Event2 never actually happens (since event1 already occurred and prevents further events), so the implication is vacuously true.
- C3 (If C2 holds, then event1 happens): True. C2 does hold, and event1 did happen (initially), so the implication is satisfied.
- C4 (Event1 happens in the next state): same as C1, so False.

Step 3 — Determine C5
- C5 is ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" C3 is true and C4 is false, so the implication is false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is True or False.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Context: event1 happened initially. After event1, no other events can happen. Therefore event2 does not and cannot happen.
2. C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" — True (from the context).
3. C2: ""Event2 does not happen."" — the same as C1, so True.
4. C3: ""C2 does not hold."" — False, because C2 holds.
5. C4: ""C1 holds or C3 holds."" — True, because C1 is true.
6. C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" — True, because C4 already holds (so it certainly holds eventually).

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked:
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Therefore event2 cannot happen at any time.

Step 3 — evaluate each condition:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" True (follows from the context).
- C2: ""Event2 does not happen."" True (same as C1).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" False (C2 does hold, so its negation is false).
- C4: ""C1 holds or C3 holds."" Since C1 is true, C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" C4 already holds immediately, so it certainly holds eventually. Therefore C5 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is True or False given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- (Also: after event2, no other events can happen — but that only matters if event2 ever occurs.)

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- From the context, event1 has occurred and no other events can happen afterwards → event2 does not happen.
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" — True.
- C2: ""Event2 does not happen."" — same as C1, True.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" — this asserts C2 is false; but C2 is true, so C3 is False.
- C4: ""C1 holds or C3 holds."" — since C1 is True, C4 is True.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" — C4 already holds (immediately), so it certainly holds at some time; therefore C5 is True.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked:
C4 is the statement “If C2 holds, then C3 holds.” We must decide whether C4 is true given the context and the definitions of C1–C3.

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- C1: Event2 does not happen.
- C2: C1 holds or event1 happens. (C2 = C1 ∨ event1)
- C3: C1 holds or event1 happens. (C3 = C1 ∨ event1)

C2 and C3 are syntactically identical.

Step 3 — use the context:
The context states event2 did happen (initially), and by the “after” rules event2 will continue to occur (so C1 is false in the given scenario). Even so, whether or not C1 is true, C2 and C3 are the same proposition.

Step 4 — evaluate C4:
An implication of a proposition to itself (P → P) is a tautology and is always true. Since C2 and C3 are identical, C4 (C2 → C3) is necessarily true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
You are asked whether C4 (""If C2 holds, then C3 holds"") is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1: Event2 does not happen.
- C2: C1 holds or event1 happens. (C2 = C1 ∨ event1)
- C3: C1 holds or event1 happens. (C3 = C1 ∨ event1)
- C4: C2 → C3.

Note C2 and C3 are the same formula.

Step 3 — reason about C4
An implication of the form P → P is always true (a formula implies itself). Therefore whenever C2 holds, C3 holds because they are identical.

(If you prefer to use the context: initially event2 happened, so C1 is false; then C2 and C3 both reduce to ""event1 happens"", and by the context event1 does indeed follow event2 — again C2 and C3 are equivalent, so C2 → C3 holds.)

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- The hypothesis asks whether C4 (""If C2 holds, then C3 holds"") is True or False.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is false because the context says event2 happened initially.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" Since C1 is false, C2 reduces to ""event1 happens."" From the context, after the initial event2, event1 must happen, so event1 does happen; therefore C2 is true.
- C3: identical to C2, so C3 is also true.

Step 3 — evaluate C4
- C4 is ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" Since C2 and C3 are both true (and in fact the same formula), the implication is true.

True"

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — What is being asked
- We must determine whether C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true or false given the context and the definitions of C1–C4.

Step 2 — Understand the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so the execution ends right after event2).
- Also, after event1 no other events can happen (event1 would also be terminal), but event1 did not happen initially.

Step 3 — Evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Given the context, event2 already happened initially and no further events can occur, so event1 does not happen. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- C3: ""Event1 always happens."" Same as C1, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" C2 is true, so C4 is true.

Step 4 — Evaluate C5
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" C4 is already true in the current (initial) state, so it certainly holds at some time (now). Therefore C5 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — understand the scenario
- Initially event2 has occurred.
- After event2, no other events can happen. Therefore event1 will never occur (there is no chance for it after the initial event2).
- The clause ""After event1, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant here because event1 never occurs.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" This is false (event1 does not occur at all).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- C3: ""Event1 always happens."" Same as C1, so false.
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" That is true ∨ false = true (so C4 holds).
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" C4 already holds initially, so C4 certainly holds at some point (now), hence C5 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. (So once event2 has happened, nothing else can occur.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (If event1 happens, it also blocks further events.)

Step 3 — trace the possible event sequence
- The initial event is event2. Because after event2 no other events can happen, there are no further events; in particular, event1 does not occur in this run.

Step 4 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" — False, because in the actual (initial) run event1 does not happen.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" — True, since C1 is false.
- C3: ""Event1 always happens."" — same as C1, so False.
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" — True, because C2 is true.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" — True, because C4 already holds immediately (so it certainly holds at some future/present point).

- After event1 no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2 no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

- C4 = (C3 or event1). Since C3 is true, C4 is true.
- Because event2 happened initially and both events are terminal, no change can make these truths false later; C1–C4 remain true at all times.

Step 3 — conclusion about C5:
- C5 asserts that C4 always holds. Given C4 is true initially and cannot become false (no further events can occur to invalidate it), C5 is true.

True
---
Step 1 — what is asked:
We must decide whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context and each condition:
- Context: Initially, event2 happened. After event1, no other events can happen. After event2, no other events can happen. So event2 has occurred at the initial moment, and both events are terminal (no further events can occur after either).
- C1: event1 happens or event2 happens.
- C2: event1 happens or event2 happens. (same as C1)
- C3: C1 holds or C2 holds.
- C4: C3 holds or event1 happens.
- C5: C4 always holds.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions given the context:
- Because event2 happened (initially), the disjunction ""event1 happens or event2 happens"" is true. So C1 is true. C2 is the same, so C2 is true.
- C3 = C1 or C2 is therefore true.
- C4 = C3 or event1 happens is true (since C3 is true).
- ""Always holds"" means C4 must be true at every reachable point in time. After the initial event2 there can be no further events, so the truth values cannot change in any future state. Since C4 is true now and no transitions can make it false, C4 holds in all states.

Conclusion:
C5 is True.
---
Step-by-step:

1. Context: Initially event2 happened. Also after either event1 or event2, no further events can occur (so the system reaches a terminal state once either event occurs).

2. C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" Given event2 already happened initially, C1 is True.

3. C2 is identical to C1, so C2 is True.

4. C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds."" Since both C1 and C2 are True, C3 is True.

5. C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" C3 is True, so C4 is True.

6. C5: ""C4 always holds."" Because C4 is a factual/disjunctive statement that is already true (due to event2 having happened and C3 being true) and no further events can change that truth in any reachable future state, C4 holds in the initial state and in all future states. Therefore C5 is True.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C5 is defined as C1 holds and C4 holds. We must decide whether C5 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event1 happened (so event1 has already occurred).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so at some later point event2 will occur).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Thus every valid trace has event1 now, then event2 later, then nothing else.

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True — it already happened initially.
- C2: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Same as C1, so True.
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" Since C2 is True, C3 is True (the disjunction holds).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 already holds now, so it holds eventually as well ⇒ True.
- C5: ""C1 holds and C4 holds."" Both are True, so C5 is True.

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C5 (which is ""C1 holds and C4 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened (so at the initial time event1 has occurred).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur sometime after the initial event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 occurs the future is event-free).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Because event1 already happened initially, C1 is true.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" Since C2 is true, C3 is true (the disjunction holds).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 is already true at the initial time, so there is a time at which C3 holds — hence C4 is true.
- C5: ""C1 holds and C4 holds."" Both C1 and C4 are true, so C5 is true.

C5 is the disjunction ""C1 holds or C4 holds"". We must determine whether that disjunction is true given the context.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition from the context
- Context: initially event2 happened; after event2, event1 must happen; after event1, no other events can happen.
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Since event2 happened initially in every allowed execution, C1 is true.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" After event2, event1 must happen, and C2 holds, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is true, C4 is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C5
C5 = C1 OR C4. C1 is true, C4 is false, so the disjunction is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what's asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C1 holds or C4 holds"") is true given the scenario.

Step 2 — examine each condition against the context
- Context: initially event2 happened; after event2, event1 must happen; after event1 no other events can happen.
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" The context only states event2 happened initially. It does not imply event2 occurs at all times or in every state, so ""always happens"" is not supported. C1 is not entailed (false).
- C2: same as C1, so also not entailed (false).
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" Event1 does happen (it must happen after event2), but C2 is false, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is false, C4 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C5
- C5 is ""C1 holds or C4 holds."" C1 is false but C4 is true, so the disjunction is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
First identify what is asked: C5 asserts that C4 holds in every state (C4 is ""C3 holds or event1 happens"").

Interpret the conditions:
- C1 = ""event2 happens in the next state"" (X event2).
- C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" (X C1 = XX event2).
- C3 = ""not C2"" (¬ XX event2).
- C4 = ""C3 or event1"" (¬XX event2 ∨ event1).
- C5 = ""always C4"" (G C4).

Use the context:
- Initially (state s0) event1 happened.
- After event1 no other events can happen, so in every future state (s1, s2, ...) no events occur. In particular event2 never occurs in any future state.
- The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never occurs.

Evaluate C4 in every state:
- At s0: event1 is true, so C4 is true.
- At any future state si (i ≥ 1): event2 never occurs, so XX event2 is false, hence C3 = ¬XX event2 is true; therefore C4 is true.

Since C4 holds at every state, C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — restate the context
- s0 is the initial state and event1 happened there.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means once event1 has occurred (i.e. from s0 onward) no further events can occur in any future state.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" says if event2 ever occurs, event1 must occur afterward — but since event1 already occurred at s0 and no events can occur after that, event2 cannot occur at any future state.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions in s0 and all future states
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Impossible, because no events can happen after event1. So C1 is false in s0.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That would require event2 to happen two steps ahead; again impossible, so C2 is false in s0 (and in every state).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false, C3 is true (in s0 and in every state).
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" C3 holds in every state, so C4 is true in every state (whether or not event1 happens in that state).
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" Because C4 is true in every state, C5 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Let s0 be the initial state. By context, event1 happens at s0.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means for every state s1, s2, ... after s0, no events (in particular event2) occurs. So event2 never holds in any state s1, s2, ...
- Unpack the conditions as state formulas at a generic state s:
  - C1(s): event2 holds at s+1.
  - C2(s): C1 holds at s+1 — equivalently, event2 holds at s+2.
  - C3(s): C2 does not hold at s — equivalently, event2 does not hold at s+2.
  - C4(s): C3(s) holds or event1 holds at s.
  - C5: C4 holds at every state (always).
- Since event2 never occurs after s0, C1(s) is false for every state s (there is no next-state event2). Therefore C2(s) is false for every s (it asserts event2 two steps ahead). Hence C3(s) = not C2(s) is true for every s.
- Because C3(s) is true at every state, C4(s) = (C3(s) or event1 at s) is true at every state.
- Therefore C4 always holds, so C5 is true."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
First: the hypothesis asks whether C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step-by-step:

- Context facts:
  - Initially event2 happened.
  - After event2, no other events can happen (so no event1 can occur after the initial event2).
  - After event1, event2 must happen (irrelevant here because event1 does not occur).

- Evaluate C1: ""Event1 always happens.""
  - This is false: the initial occurrence is event2 and after that no events can occur, so event1 does not (and cannot) always happen.

- Evaluate C2: same as C1, so C2 is false.

- Evaluate C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds.""
  - As a material implication, this is true: the antecedent C1 is false, so C1 ⇒ C2 is true.

- Evaluate C4: ""C3 always holds.""
  - C3 is true (and remains true under the given context), so C3 holds at all times. Thus C4 is true.

- Evaluate C5: ""C4 eventually holds.""
  - Since C4 holds now (indeed always), it certainly holds at some time in the future — so C5 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — What is asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true or false given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — Understand each condition
- Context:
  - Initially event2 happened.
  - After event2, no other events can happen. (So from the initial state onward, no further events occur.)
  - After event1, event2 must happen. (If event1 ever occurs, a later event2 must follow.)
- Conditions:
  - C1: Event1 always happens. (G event1 — event1 holds at every point.)
  - C2: Event1 always happens. (Same as C1.)
  - C3: If C1 holds, then C2 holds. (C1 → C2. Since C1 and C2 are identical, this is p → p.)
  - C4: C3 always holds. (G(C1 → C2).)
  - C5: C4 eventually holds. (F C4.)

Step 3 — Evaluate the conditions given the context
- From the context: event2 happened initially and no events occur afterwards. Therefore event1 never occurs in any execution (there is no opportunity to perform event1 after the initial event2, and it did not occur before).
- Thus C1 (G event1) is false, and C2 is false as well.
- C3 is the implication C1 → C2. An implication p → p is always true regardless of p’s truth value, so C3 is true.
- C4 is ""C3 always holds."" Since C3 is true, C4 holds (indeed it holds at the initial state and at all states).
- C5 is ""C4 eventually holds."" Because C4 already holds immediately (and at all times), it certainly holds at some time in the future — so C5 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We are asked whether C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is True or False given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. Since event2 happened initially, no events can happen at any later time.
- After event1, event2 must happen. Given that event2 already happened and no events can happen after it, event1 cannot occur (because if event1 occurred, event2 would have to occur afterward, which is impossible). So in every possible execution consistent with the context, event1 never occurs.

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" This is false (event1 never happens).
- C2: same as C1, so also false.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" An implication with identical antecedent and consequent is true; more generally, since C1 is false, the implication is vacuously true. So C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" C3 is a true (global) statement, so it holds at all times — C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" If C4 holds at all times, then in particular it holds at some time, so C5 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""If C1 holds, then C4 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — translate the context and conditions
- Context: event1 happened (so event1 is true). Also after event1 (and after event2) no other events can happen — not needed further here.
- C1: ¬event1.
- C2: ¬event1 (same as C1).
- C3: C2 -> event1, i.e. (¬event1 -> event1).
- C4: event2 ∨ C3.
- C5: C1 -> C4, i.e. (¬event1 -> (event2 ∨ C3)).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions given the context
- event1 is true, so C1 and C2 are false.
- C3: (¬event1 -> event1) is logically equivalent to event1 (because ¬p -> p ≡ p). Since event1 is true, C3 is true.
- C4: event2 ∨ C3 is true because C3 is true.

Step 4 — conclude about C5
- C4 is true, so the implication C1 -> C4 holds (an implication with a true consequent is true; also C1 is false anyway).
- Therefore C5 is True.

Answer: True
---
Step 1 — facts from the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1 no other events can happen, so no other event (including event2) can happen after that.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" False, because event1 did happen initially.
- C2: same as C1, so False.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" This implication has a false antecedent (C2 is False), so C3 is True (vacuously).
- C4: ""Event2 happens or C3 holds."" C3 is True, so C4 is True (regardless of event2).
- C5: ""If C1 holds, then C4 holds."" The antecedent C1 is False, so the implication C1 → C4 is True (vacuously).

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
First identify what’s being asked:
- C5 asserts that C4 holds at all times (C4 is ""always true""). We must decide if that is True or False given the context.

Examine the conditions algebraically:
- C1 = event2 ∨ event1.
- C2 = event2 ∨ event1 (same as C1).
- C3 = C2 ∨ event2 = (event2 ∨ event1) ∨ event2 = event2 ∨ event1 (same).
- C4 = C1 ∨ C3 = (event2 ∨ event1) ∨ (event2 ∨ event1) = event2 ∨ event1.

So C4 is equivalent to (event1 ∨ event2).

Use the scenario constraints:
- Initially, event1 happened, so C4 is true at the initial moment (event1 is true).
- After event1, no other events can happen, so no future event can make event1 false or introduce event2 after that point. Thus once the initial event1 has happened there are no transitions that could make C4 false.
- If event2 were to happen before event1, the rule “after event2, event1 must happen” forces event1 to occur afterward, and then no further events can happen. Either way, any reachable state has event1 (or event2 together with a later event1), so event1 ∨ event2 holds in all reachable states.

Therefore C4 holds in every state reachable under the given constraints, so C5 (“C4 always holds”) is True.
---
Step 1 — identify goal
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true or false given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true at the initial time.
- After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 ever occurs, there must be an event1 later).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal; nothing can change after it).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: (event2) or (event1). Since event1 happened initially, C1 is true.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is true.
- C3: C2 or event2. C2 is true, so C3 is true.
- C4: C1 or C3. Both C1 and C3 are true, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" Because event1 already happened and no events can occur after it, the truth values of these propositions cannot change later. C4 is true now and remains true at all future times (there are no future events that could falsify it). Therefore C5 holds.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Initially event1 happened. So at the initial moment ""event1 happens"" is true.
2. C1 = (event2 happens) or (event1 happens). Because event1 already happened, C1 is true at the initial moment.
3. C2 is identical to C1, so C2 is also true initially.
4. C3 = C2 holds or event2 happens. Since C2 holds, C3 is true.
5. C4 = C1 holds or C3 holds. Both C1 and C3 are true, so C4 is true.
6. The context also says: after event1, no other events can happen. Since event1 already happened initially, there can be no future occurrence of event2 or any other event that could change the truth of these formulas.
7. Therefore C4 remains true at all times (it cannot become false later), so C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
We must decide whether C4 (""C2 holds or C3 holds"") is true or false given the context and the definitions of C1–C3.

Step 2 — examine the context and derive which events happen
- Initially event1 happened → event1 is true.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" → because event1 occurred, event2 happens (at some later time).
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" → because event2 now occurs, event1 happens (again).
Thus both event1 and event2 do occur. So C1 (""event2 happens and event1 happens"") is true.

Step 3 — examine C2 and C3
- C2: If C1 holds, then event1 happens. Since C1 is true and event1 happens, the implication C1 → event1 is true.
- C3 is the same statement as C2, so it is also true.

Step 4 — evaluate C4
C4 is ""C2 holds or C3 holds"". Since both C2 and C3 are true, their disjunction C4 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Task: is C4 true or false?

1) What is asked
- C4 is the disjunction ""C2 holds or C3 holds"". We must determine whether C4 is true given the context.

2) Understand the context and each condition
- Context: initially event1 happened. Also: ""after event1, event2 must happen"" and ""after event2, event1 must happen."" So event1 occurs at start, which forces event2 to occur, which in turn forces event1, etc. Thus both event1 and event2 do occur.
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" Given the context, C1 is true.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" This conditional is true: C1 is true and its consequent (event1 happens) is true, so the implication holds.
- C3: same as C2, so C3 is also true.

3) Conclusion about C4
- C4 = C2 or C3. Since both C2 and C3 are true, C4 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify goal:
- We must decide whether C4 (""C2 holds or C3 holds"") is True or False.

Step 2 — examine context and C1:
- Context: initially event1 happened. Also ""after event1, event2 must happen"" and ""after event2, event1 must happen.""
- From ""initially event1 happened"" and ""after event1, event2 must happen"" we get that event2 does happen at some later point. Thus both event1 and event2 occur. Therefore C1 (""event2 happens and event1 happens"") is true.

Step 3 — examine C2 and C3:
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Since C1 already includes event1, the implication is trivially true whenever C1 holds. So C2 is true.
- C3 is the same statement as C2, so C3 is also true.

Step 4 — conclude about C4:
- C4 is ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" With C2 true (and C3 true), the disjunction C4 is true.

3. C2 is ""if C1 then event1"". Since C1 is true and event1 is true, C2 is true.
4. C4 is the same as C1, so C4 is true.
5. C5 is ""C3 or C4"". Regardless of the truth of C3, C4 is true, so the disjunction C5 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what’s asked:
- Determine whether C5 (C3 ∨ C4) is true given the context.

Step 2 — simplify the conditions:
- C1 = (event1 ∧ event1) which is equivalent to event1.
- C4 is identical to C1, so C4 is also equivalent to event1.
- C2 = (C1 ⇒ event1). Since C1 ≡ event1, C2 is (event1 ⇒ event1), which is true whenever event1 holds and is a tautology relative to C1 (more generally, an implication with the same antecedent and consequent is always true when the antecedent is true and is vacuously true if the antecedent is false).
- C3 says “C2 holds in the next state.”

Step 3 — use the context:
- Initially event1 happened, so at the initial state event1 is true. Therefore C4 (which is event1) is true at the initial state.
- Hence C5 = C3 ∨ C4 is true immediately (no need to evaluate C3).

Conclusion:
True
---
Summary reasoning (concise):

- C1 is ""event1 and event1"", i.e. equivalent to event1; since initially event1 happened, C1 is true in the initial state.
- C2 is ""if C1 then event1"". Since C1 ≡ event1, C2 is the tautology event1 → event1, so C2 holds in any state.
- C3 says ""C2 holds in the next state"". There is a next state after the initial one (the context says after event1 no other events can happen, which yields a following state with no events), and C2 holds in every state, so C3 is true.
- C4 is the same as C1 (event1), so C4 is true in the initial state.
- C5 is C3 or C4; since both C3 and C4 are true, C5 is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
We must decide whether the statement C5 (""If C1 holds, then C4 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — use the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So no event after event1 can occur — in particular, event2 does not happen.
- (The extra sentence “After event2, no other events can happen” is irrelevant here because event2 never occurs.)

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Antecedent is true (event1 happened) but consequent is false (event2 did not happen), so C1 is false.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is also false.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" Since event1 is true, C3 is true.
- C4: ""Event1 happens and C3 holds."" Both parts are true, so C4 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C5
- C5: ""If C1 holds, then C4 holds."" This is an implication C1 → C4. Since C1 is false, the implication is vacuously true (an implication with a false antecedent is true regardless of the consequent). Therefore C5 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step-by-step:

1. From the context: event1 happened (initially). Also, after event1 no other events can happen. Therefore event2 did not happen.

2. C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Since event1 did happen but event2 did not, C1 is false.

3. C2 is the same as C1, so C2 is false.

4. C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" That is false OR true = true, so C3 is true.

5. C4: ""Event1 happens and C3 holds."" That is true AND true = true, so C4 is true.

6. C5: ""If C1 holds, then C4 holds."" C1 is false, and C4 is true; a material implication with a false antecedent is true. Thus C5 is true.

True

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. The question asks whether C5 (""Event1 happens or C4 holds"") is true given the context and the conditions C1–C4.

2. From the context:
   - Initially event2 happened. So ""event2 eventually happens"" (C1 and C2) is already satisfied at the initial state. Thus C1 and C2 are true.
   - Therefore C3 (C1 and C2) is true in the initial state.
   - Also, after event2 no other events can happen, so event1 cannot occur at any later point.

3. Consider C4: ""C3 holds in the next state.""
   - In the next state, no further events can happen (by the context). If event2 does not occur again in the future from that next state, then ""event2 eventually happens"" is false in that next state. Hence C1 and C2 would be false in the next state, so C3 would be false there. Therefore C4 is false.

4. C5 is ""Event1 happens or C4 holds."" We have established event1 cannot happen, and C4 is false; therefore C5 is false.

So the final answer is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. From the context, event2 has already happened in the initial state. So ""event2 eventually happens"" (C1 and C2) is true in the initial state. Hence C3 (C1 and C2) is true initially.
2. C4 requires C3 to hold in the next state. But after event2 no other events can happen, so there is no future occurrence of event2. Either there is no next state at all (so X-properties fail) or, if a next state exists, ""event2 eventually happens"" is not true there (event2 already occurred and will not occur again). In either interpretation C3 does not hold in the next state, so C4 is false.
3. C5 is ""event1 happens or C4 holds."" Event1 does not happen (after event2 no other events can happen), and C4 is false, so C5 is false.
---
Step 1 — what is asked
We must decide whether C5 (""Event1 happens or C4 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — unpack the context
- Initially, event2 happened. So in the initial state event2 is true.
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 ever occurs, event2 must occur afterward).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal; once event2 has occurred, no further events occur).

Step 3 — evaluate the claims in the initial state
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True (it already happened initially).
- C2: same as C1, so True.
- C3: C1 and C2, therefore True.

- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" We must check C3 from the next state. In the next state, no events can occur (because event2 occurred initially and is terminal), so from the next state event2 will not occur in the future. Thus ""event2 eventually happens"" is false in the next state, so C3 is false in the next state, so C4 is False.

- Event1 happens? It does not happen initially, and it cannot happen later because no events can occur after the initial event2. So ""Event1 happens"" is False.

Step 4 — evaluate C5
C5 = ""Event1 happens or C4 holds"" = False or False = False.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
We must decide whether C5 (C4 holds or event1 happens) is true given the context and the definitions C1–C5, evaluated at the initial state.

Step 2 — simplify the conditions
- C1: ""event2 and event2"" is just event2.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" is therefore: event2 holds in the next state.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" means there is some future state whose next state has event2 (equivalently, event2 holds at some future time > now).
- C4: ""C3 holds or event2 happens"" is: (event2 holds now) or (event2 holds at some future time > now).
- C5: ""C4 holds or event1 happens"" is: ((event2 now) or (event2 sometime later)) or (event1 now).

Step 3 — apply the context
The context says initially event2 happened, so event2 holds in the initial state.

Step 4 — conclude
Since event2 holds now, C4 is true (it is the disjunction C3 or event2). Therefore C5 (C4 or event1) is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Goal: decide whether C5 (""C4 holds or event1 happens"") is true in the initial state given the context.

Context restated:
- Initially event2 happened (call that state S0: event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so S1: event1).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so S2: event2), and so on alternating forever: S0: event2, S1: event1, S2: event2, S3: event1, ...

Evaluate the conditions at the initial state S0:

- C1: ""event2 and event2"" — equivalent to ""event2"". At S0 this is true (S0 has event2). At S1 it is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — means C1 is true at S1. C1 is false at S1, so C2 is false at S0. (C2 would be true at S1 because C1 is true at S2.)
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — there exists some future state where C2 is true. From S0, C2 is true at S1, so C3 is true at S0.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event2 happens"" — at S0, C3 is true and event2 is true, so C4 is true at S0. (Indeed C3 is true at every state, so C4 is always true.)
- C5: ""C4 holds or event1 happens"" — since C4 is true at S0, C5 is true at S0 (disjunction true).

Conclusion: C5 is True

True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C5 (which is ""C4 holds or event1 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — translate the context into a timeline
- Initially (time 0) event2 happens.
- The rules force alternation: after event2 the next state has event1, and after event1 the next state has event2.
- So the infinite timeline is: t0: event2, t1: event1, t2: event2, t3: event1, … (alternating).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions on that timeline
- C1: ""event2 and event2"" — at any state where event2 holds this is true. At t0 (event2) C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — at a state s this is true iff s+1 has event2. For example at t1 (event1) the next state t2 has event2, so C2 is true at t1. At t0, C2 is false because t1 does not have event2.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — there exists some future state where C2 is true. Yes: at t1 C2 is true, so C3 is true at t0.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event2 happens"" — at t0 event2 happens, and also we just saw C3 is true, so C4 is true at t0.
- C5: ""C4 holds or event1 happens"" — since C4 is true at t0, C5 is true at t0 (regardless of event1).

Conclusion
- Given the context, C5 is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
C5 asserts: ""C4 holds in the next state."" We must decide whether that is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — interpret the context and trace the timeline
- Initially (time t0) event2 happened.
- The rules force alternation: after any state with event2, event1 must happen next; after any state with event1, event2 must happen next.
- So the timeline is: t0: event2, t1: event1, t2: event2, t3: event1, … (alternating forever).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" Interpreted globally (both events occur somewhere in the timeline) — true, since both events occur in the sequence.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" This would mean at every state both event1 and event2 hold simultaneously. That is false (at t0 only event2, at t1 only event1), so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false, C3 is true.
- C4: ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds."" C3 is a global truth (C2 is false), so whenever event2 happens the consequent C3 is true. Thus C4 is true at any state.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" From the initial state (t0), the next state is t1. At t1, as above, C4 is true (either vacuously because event2 does not hold at t1, or because C3 is true anyway). Therefore C4 does hold in the next state.

Final answer
True
---
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step

1. Model the timeline from the context:
   - s0 (initial): event2 happens.
   - By ""after event2, event1 must happen"", at s1 event1 happens.
   - By ""after event1, event2 must happen"", at s2 event2 happens, and so on.
   So the system alternates: s0: e2, s1: e1, s2: e2, s3: e1, ...

2. Evaluate C1–C3:
   - C1 = (event1 and event2) as a state formula. Under the alternation, there is no state where both event1 and event2 hold simultaneously, so C1 is false at every state.
   - C2 = ""C1 always holds"" (i.e. globally). Since C1 is false everywhere, C2 is false.
   - C3 = ""C2 does not hold"" = ¬C2. Thus C3 is true (everywhere).

3. Evaluate C4 and C5:
   - C4 = (if event2 happens, then C3 holds). Since C3 is true, the implication holds whenever event2 happens (in fact it holds at every state).
   - C5 = ""C4 holds in the next state"". From s0, the next state s1 satisfies C4 (C4 is true at s1 as argued), so C5 is true at the initial state.

Therefore C5 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
C5 says: ""C4 holds in the next state."" We must decide whether that is true given the initial context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — interpret the context (trace)
Initially (time t0) event2 happened. The rules force alternating events:
- after event2 must come event1,
- after event1 must come event2.
So a valid trace is: t0: event2, t1: event1, t2: event2, t3: event1, … (alternating).

Step 3 — evaluate each condition on that trace
- C1: ""event1 and event2"" — both happening in the same state. In the alternating trace no state has both simultaneously, so C1 is false (at every state).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — false, since C1 is not true at states.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — true (C2 is false). This is a global fact and thus holds at every state.
- C4: ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds"" — since C3 is true, the implication is true whenever event2 happens (and vacuously true when event2 does not happen). So C4 holds at every state.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" — because C4 holds at every state, it certainly holds in the next state.

Answer: False

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Identify the hypothesis
- The question asks whether C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is True or False given the context.

2) Translate the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so because event1 did happen, event2 will occur at some future point).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Thus in every allowed execution/event trace, event2 does occur (some time after the initial event1).

3) Examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Given the context, this is false (event2 must happen).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3: ""Event2 does not happen."" Same as C1, false.
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" Both disjuncts are false, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" For C5 to be true, C4 would have to become true at some time. But C4 is the disjunction of statements that assert event2 never happens; because event2 is guaranteed to happen in every allowed trace, neither C2 nor C3 can ever become true. Therefore C4 can never hold, so C5 is false.

Conclusion: C5 is False.
---

---
False

Reason: Initially event1 happened and the context requires that after event1 event2 must happen, so event2 does occur. That makes C1 (and hence C2 and C3) false, so C4 (C2 or C3) is false and never becomes true; therefore C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is false."

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C5 is True or False.

Step-by-step:
- From the context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 event2 must happen — so event2 does happen in the next state. Therefore C1 (event2 happens in the next state) is True.
- C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" → C2 = not C1 = False.
- C3 is ""C2 does not hold"" → C3 = not C2 = True.
- C4 is ""C3 does not hold"" → C4 = not C3 = False.
- C5 is ""C4 does not hold"" → C5 = not C4 = True.

Final answer:
True

We are asked whether C5 is true or false given the event constraints.

Context: Initially event1 happened, and the rules force an alternating sequence: event1 then event2 next, then event1, etc. So in the immediate next state after the initial one, event2 happens.

Evaluate the Ci:

- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" This is true (by the given rule).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is true, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" C2 is false, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" C3 is true, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" C4 is false, so C5 is true.

Therefore C5 is True.

Final answer: True

Goal: is C5 true or false?

Step-by-step:
- Context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 event2 must happen. So in the next state event2 does happen.
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" — True.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" — False (because C1 is True).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" — True (because C2 is False).
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" — False (because C3 is True).
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" — True (because C4 is False).

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the claim:
- C5 is ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" We must decide whether that disjunction is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — evaluate the individual conditions:
- Let p be ""event1 happens.""
- C1: p → p. In classical logic p → p is always true (a tautology). Also in the given context p is actually true (event1 happened initially), so C1 is true.
- C2: p → p. Same as C1, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Since C1 is true and C2 is true, C3 (C1 → C2) is true.
- C4: p → p. Same tautology again, so C4 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C5:
- C5 is ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" Both C3 and C4 are true, so the disjunction C5 is true.

Conclusion: True

Identify the goal: determine the truth of C5 given the conditions.

Examine the conditions:
- C1: (event1 → event1). An implication of the form p → p is always true.
- C2: same as C1, so true.
- C4: same as C1, so true.
- C3: (C1 → C2). Since C1 is true and C2 is true, the implication C1 → C2 is true.

C5 is (C3 ∨ C4). Both C3 and C4 are true, so their disjunction is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — What is being asked
The hypothesis asks whether C5 is true or false. C5 is the disjunction ""C3 holds or C4 holds.""

Step 2 — Examine each condition
- Let P be ""event1 happens.""
- C1: P → P. This is a tautology (and also true here because P is true initially).
- C2: P → P. Same as C1, true.
- C4: P → P. Same as C1/C2, true.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Since C1 is true and C2 is true, the implication C1 → C2 is true.

Step 3 — Evaluate C5
C5 = C3 ∨ C4. Both C3 and C4 are true, so their disjunction is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — understand the context
- Initially event2 has occurred.
- Once event2 has occurred, no further events can occur (so there is no successor/next state).
- The clause “After event1, event2 must happen” is irrelevant here because event1 cannot occur (no further events after event2).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions one by one
- C1: “Event2 happens and event2 happens.” Since event2 happened initially, C1 is true in the initial (and only) state.
- C2: “C1 eventually holds.” Because C1 already holds now, it holds eventually (the “eventually” operator includes the current state), so C2 is true.
- C3: “C2 always holds.” There are no future states beyond the initial state, and C2 holds now, so C2 holds at every (existent) state — C3 is true.
- C4: “If C3 holds, then event2 happens.” C3 does hold and event2 did happen, so the implication C4 is true in the current state.
- C5: “C4 holds in the next state.” But there is no next state (no events can occur after event2), so the “next” assertion is not satisfied. In standard temporal semantics, X φ (φ in the next state) is false when no next state exists. Therefore C5 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — decode the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — this is just equivalent to ""event2 happens"" (redundant).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — from a state, eventually event2 will occur in the future.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — at every state, it is true that eventually event2 will occur.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens"" — (in that state) C3 → event2.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" — in the next state the implication C3 → event2 is true.

Step 3 — apply the context to the next state
- Initially (state 0) event2 happened.
- The context says: after event2, no other events can happen. So in the next state (state 1) there will be no events, and in particular event2 will not occur in state 1 or any later state.
- Evaluate C3 in state 1: C3 requires that at every state (including state 1) eventually event2 occurs. But from state 1 there will be no future event2, so ""eventually event2"" (C2) is false in state 1. Hence C3 is false in state 1.
- Evaluate C4 in state 1: C4 is the implication (C3 → event2). Since C3 is false in state 1, the implication is true in state 1 (a false antecedent makes the implication true), regardless of whether event2 holds in state 1.

Therefore C4 holds in the next state, so C5 is True.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Model the timeline: at state 0 (initial) event2 is true. After event2 no other events can happen, so in every later state (state1, state2, ...) no events occur and event2 is false.

- C1 = (event2 and event2) which is equivalent to event2. So C1 holds at state0 and not at state1 onward.

- C2 = ""eventually C1"": at state0 this is true (C1 holds immediately); at state1 this is false (no future event2).

- C3 = ""always C2"": this requires C2 to hold in every state; because C2 is false at state1, C3 is false (at state0 as well, since it's not true in all states).

- C4 = (if C3 then event2): at state1 C3 is false, so the implication C4 is true there (false -> anything is true).

- C5 = ""C4 holds in the next state"" (i.e., X C4) is true at state0 because C4 is true at state1.

Therefore C5 is True."

Sample responses:
You are asking whether C5 (""If event1 happens, then C4 holds"") is true given the context.

Step-by-step reasoning

- Context trace: sequence is event2 initially, then event1, then event2, then event1, … (alternating indefinitely). So at every time step either event1 or event2 happens.
- C1 = (event1 ∨ event2). Given the trace, C1 is true at every moment.
- C2 = ◇C1 (C1 eventually holds). Since C1 holds now (indeed always), C2 holds at every moment.
- C3 = □C2 (C2 always holds). From the previous line, C2 holds always, so C3 is true.
- C4 = ◇C3 (C3 eventually holds). Since C3 already holds, C4 holds.
- C5 = (event1 → C4). C4 is true in all states, so the implication holds whenever event1 happens.

Final answer:
True
---
We are asked whether C5 (""If event1 happens, then C4 holds"") is true given the system.

1) Identify the question
- C5 is the implication: event1 → C4. We must decide whether this implication holds under the given event behavior.

2) Understand the system and each condition
- System: initially event2 occurred, and thereafter after every event2 an event1 must occur, and after every event1 an event2 must occur. So there is an infinite alternating sequence of events starting with event2: e2, e1, e2, e1, ...
- C1: event1 ∨ event2. At event times this is true; there are infinitely many event times.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" From any point in the run there is a next event (because events continue alternating), so eventually (event1 ∨ event2) holds. Thus C2 is true from every point.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Because from every point eventually an event occurs, C2 holds at every point, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Since C3 already holds now (indeed holds at all times), it certainly holds at some future time — so C4 is true.
- C5: ""If event1 happens, then C4 holds."" The consequent C4 is true unconditionally, so the implication is true whenever the antecedent is true (and also true when antecedent is false). Hence C5 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether the statement C5 (""If event1 happens, then C4 holds"") is true given the described behavior of the system.

Step 2 — unpack the system behavior
- Initially event2 happened.
- After any event2, event1 must happen.
- After any event1, event2 must happen.
- Therefore every execution is an infinite alternation: event2, event1, event2, event1, ... (so at every point one of the two events occurs, and each event occurs infinitely often).

Step 3 — interpret the conditions (using standard temporal meanings: ""eventually"" = sometime now or in future; ""always"" = at all times)
- C1: event1 or event2. Given the alternating sequence, C1 holds at every state.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" True (indeed C1 holds immediately).
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" = ""always eventually C1"" (G F C1). True, because C1 keeps occurring forever.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" = ""at some time, from then on always eventually C1."" Since C3 already holds from the start, C4 is true (it holds immediately).
- C5: ""If event1 happens, then C4 holds."" Because C4 holds globally (at the initial state and thus at every state), whenever event1 happens the antecedent is true and the consequent C4 is also true. Hence the implication is true.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C5 is True.

True"

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
You are asked whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true or false, given the context and the chain C1→C2→C3→C4→C5.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened (so event1 is true at the initial state).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so no events — including event1 again — can occur in any subsequent state).
- After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur after the initial event1).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — equivalent to ""event1 happens"". True at the initial state (given).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens"" — still equivalent to ""event1 happens"". True at the initial state.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — requires event1 to hold in the next state. But by the context, after event1 no events can happen, so event1 does not occur in the next state. Therefore C3 is false (it does not hold in the next state).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" — since C3 never holds in any future state, C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 always holds"" — since C4 is false, C5 is false.

Final answer
False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 is true in the initial state).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so in every state after the initial one, event1 and any other events are false).
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 can never occur (it cannot occur after the initial event1, and it could not occur before the initial event1).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""event1 happens or event1 happens"" — equivalent to ""event1 happens"". True in the initial state.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens"" — reduces to ""event1"" and is true in the initial state.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — requires event1 to hold in the next state. But after event1 no events happen, so in the next state event1 is false. Therefore C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" — since C3 is false now and will never become true (no events occur later), C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 always holds"" — since C4 is false now (and not true later), C5 is false.

Final answer
False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
We must decide whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true given the context. So we need to evaluate C1–C5 over the possible execution(s) of the system described.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So in the initial state event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen. That means in any successor state after the initial one no events occur (in particular event1 does not occur again, and event2 never occurs after event1).
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" This rule is irrelevant in this system because event2 never occurs (we already have event1 initially and no events occur afterwards).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens."" This is equivalent to just ""event1 happens."" So C1 is true in the initial state (because event1 happened initially).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" That is just event1 ∧ event1, so C2 is also true in the initial state.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" This requires C2 to be true at the successor state. But after event1 no other events can happen, so in the next state event1 does not happen; hence C1 and C2 are false in the next state. Therefore C3 is false in the initial state.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Since C3 is false now and will never become true later (no future state has event1), C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" Because C4 is false in the current (initial) state, C5 is false.

C5 is False."

Sample responses:
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Initially event1 happened. Therefore C1 (""event1 or event2"") is true in the initial state.

2. C2 is the implication ""if event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Given C1 is defined as ""event1 or event2"", whenever event1 happens the disjunction C1 is true, so C2 is logically true in any state where it is evaluated (it is either directly true when event1 happens, or vacuously true when event1 does not happen).

3. C3 says ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is a logical implication that is true in every state (as argued above), C3 is true in every state.

4. C4 says ""C3 holds in the next state."" Because C3 holds in all states, it in particular holds in the next state, so C4 is true now.

5. C5 says ""C4 eventually holds."" C4 already holds now, so it certainly holds at some (in fact at the current) time in the future — hence C5 is true.

The constraints about no further events occurring after event1 (and after event2) do not invalidate these logical truths. Therefore C5 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- C5 states: ""C4 eventually holds."" We must decide whether C5 is true in the initial situation given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context and the Ci
- Context: initially event1 has happened, and after event1 (and also after event2) no other events can happen. So the initial state is terminal: there are no successor states after the initial state.
- C1: ""event1 happens or event2 happens."" That is true in the initial state because event1 has happened.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" This is trivially true (if event1 then (event1 or event2)). In any state where event1 holds the implication yields C1; in states where event1 does not hold the implication is vacuously true. So C2 is true in every state.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is true in every state, C3 is true (C2 holds in all states).

Step 3 — the crucial next/ eventually reasoning
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" This requires there to be a next state. But the context says after event1 no other events can happen, so the initial state has no successor. Under the usual temporal semantics where X p (next p) is false if there is no next state, C4 is false in the initial state.
- C5: ""Eventually C4 holds."" Because there are no successor states at all, there is no future state where C4 could become true. So ""eventually C4"" is false.

Conclusion
- C5 is False.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. C1 (""event1 or event2"") is true initially because the context says event1 happened initially.
2. C2 (""if event1 then C1"") is a propositional tautology: event1 ⇒ (event1 ∨ event2) always holds.
3. Therefore C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true — a tautology holds at every state, so ""always C2"" is true.
4. C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is true because C3 holds at every state, including the next one.
5. C5 (""eventually C4"") is true because C4 already holds now (hence it holds at some future point).

So C5 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. C1 and C2 are identical: both state “Event2 always happens.”  
2. C3 is “If C1 holds, then C2 holds.” That is P -> P, which is a tautology and therefore true in every state (it holds regardless of whether C1 actually holds).  
3. C4 is “If event2 happens, then C3 holds.” Since C3 is always true, the implication in C4 is true whenever evaluated (implication with a true consequent is true). So C4 holds (in fact, always).  
4. C5 asserts that C4 eventually holds. Because C4 already holds (even at the initial state, and certainly eventually), C5 is true.
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — translate the conditions
- Context:
  - Initially, event2 happened (so at the initial moment event2 is true).
  - After event2, no other events can happen (so there are no further moments with other events).
  - Also: ""After event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event1 does not occur in the given trace.
- Hypothesis items:
  - C1: ""Event2 always happens"" (i.e., globally/eventually-for-all-times, event2 holds).
  - C2: ""Event2 always happens"" (same as C1).
  - C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"" (a conditional between identical statements).
  - C4: ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds.""
  - C5: ""C4 eventually holds.""

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions on the actual trace
- The trace has event2 at the initial moment and then no further moments. So at every moment of the trace (there is only the initial moment), event2 holds. Thus the global property ""Event2 always happens"" is true on this trace. Therefore C1 is true and C2 is true.
- C3 is the implication ""if C1 then C2"". With C1 true and C2 true, C3 is true.
- C4 is ""if event2 happens then C3 holds."" Event2 does happen (at the initial moment), and we just saw C3 holds, so C4 is true at that moment.
- Since C4 is true at the initial moment, C4 holds eventually (indeed, immediately).

Conclusion
- C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is True.
---
We are asked whether C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is True.

Step-by-step:
- Context: event2 happened initially; after event2 no further events can occur. So event2 does occur (at time 0).
- C1 and C2 are the same statement: ""Event2 always happens.""
- C3 is ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Since C1 and C2 are identical, C3 is the tautological implication P -> P and therefore is true (independent of whether C1 actually holds).
- C4 is ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds."" Event2 does happen (initially), and C3 is true, so C4 holds (in fact it holds at the initial time).
- C5 says C4 eventually holds. Because C4 already holds, C5 is true.

You ask whether C5 holds (True or False).

1) From the context: event2 happened initially, and after event2 no other events can happen. Therefore event1 does not happen (it cannot happen before initial event2, and cannot happen after).

2) Evaluate the conditions:
- C1 = (event1 and event2). Since event1 is false and event2 is true, C1 is false.
- C2 = (if event1 then C1). Because event1 is false, the implication is vacuously true, so C2 is true. (This also matches the given rule “after event1, event2 must happen”.)
- C3 = (C2 and event2). C2 is true and event2 is true, so C3 is true.
- C4 = (event1 and C3). event1 is false, so C4 is false.
- C5 = (not C4). Since C4 is false, C5 is true.

Answer: True
---
Answering what C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is.

1) Context:
- Initially event2 happened (so event2 is true).
- After event2, no other events can happen → no events occur after that initial event2.
- After event1, event2 must happen.

2) Evaluate each Ci:
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" event2 is true, but event1 cannot occur (because event2 already happened initially and no events can happen after it). So C1 is false.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" This is an implication with a false antecedent (event1 does not happen), so C2 is true (vacuously). It also agrees with the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"", which would make C1 hold if event1 did happen.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" Both parts are true, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""Event1 happens and C3 holds."" C3 holds but event1 does not, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is false, C5 is true.

First, what is being asked: is C5 (always C4) true given the facts?

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. From the context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. Therefore event2 never occurs (it cannot occur after the initial event1, and there is no earlier occurrence). So C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is true.

2. C2 is ""C1 holds or event2 happens"". Since C1 is true, C2 is true (a true disjunct makes the disjunction true).

3. C3 is ""C2 holds in the next state"". Because C2 is true now (and nothing can make it false later — there are no events that could make event2 happen), C2 will also hold in any next state; hence C3 holds whenever a next state exists. Even if no meaningful events occur, the truth of C2 is preserved, so C3 holds.

4. C4 is ""If event1 happens, then C3 holds"". Event1 happens only initially, and in that initial state C3 holds (from step 3). In any state where event1 does not happen the implication is trivially true. So C4 holds in every state.

5. Therefore C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true.

Final answer: True
---

---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened. 
- After event1, no other events can happen (so the initial state is terminal — there is no next state).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 would also be terminal if it occurred).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" In the initial state event2 indeed does not happen — so C1 is true initially.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" Since C1 is (not event2), C2 is (not event2) or event2, which is a tautology — C2 is true in any state where it is evaluated.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" This asserts something about the next state. But the initial state is terminal (no next state) because event1 happened and no further events can occur. In standard temporal semantics, a ""next"" assertion is false in a state with no successor. Therefore C3 is false in the initial state.
- C4: ""If event1 happens, then C3 holds."" Event1 does happen in the initial state, but C3 is false there, so the implication is false in the initial state.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" Since C4 fails in the initial state, C5 does not hold.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C5 is False.

False"

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Context: initially event2 happened. After event2, no other events can happen (so there is no next state reachable from the initial state). Also after event1, event2 must happen (irrelevant here because event1 does not occur).

2. Evaluate conditions in the initial state:
   - C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is false because event2 did happen initially.
   - C2: same as C1, also false.
   - C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" This implication is vacuously true because C2 is false.
   - C4: ""C1 holds or C3 holds."" C1 is false but C3 is true, so C4 is true (in the initial state).

3. C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" There is no next state (after event2 no other events can happen), so C4 cannot be said to hold in a next state. Therefore C5 is false.

Conclusion: C5 is False.
---
C5 is False.

Reasoning (concise):
- Initially event2 happened, so ""event2 does not happen"" (C1 and C2) is false.
- C3 (""if C2 then event2"") is true (the antecedent C2 is false → implication holds).
- C4 (C1 or C3) is true (false or true).
- C5 asserts that C4 holds in the next state; but after event2 no other events can happen, so there is no next state in which to evaluate C4. Therefore C5 is false.
---
True

Step-by-step:

1. Initial state: event2 happened. Therefore C1 (event2 does not happen) and C2 are false in the initial state.

2. C3 is ""if C2 then event2 happens."" In the initial state C2 is false, so C3 is vacuously true there. Hence C4 = C1 or C3 is true in the initial state.

3. Consider the next state. The context says “after event2, no other events can happen,” so in the next state no events occur; in particular, event2 does not happen in that next state. Thus C1 and C2 are true in the next state.

4. In that next state C3 (“if C2 then event2 happens”) has a true antecedent (C2) and a false consequent (event2 does not happen), so C3 is false there. But C4 = C1 or C3 is true (because C1 is true).

5. Therefore C4 holds in the next state, i.e. C5 is true."

Step 2 — Understand the context
- Initially, event2 happened.

- Therefore, in the actual timeline: event2 occurs initially and no further events occur. Event1 does not occur.

---
Goal: evaluate whether C5 is True or False.

1) What is being asked?
- C5 is ""C4 does not hold."" We must determine whether C5 is true given the context.

2) Understand each condition:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens."" This is equivalent to ""Event1 happens.""
- C2: same as C1, so C2 ≡ ""Event1 happens.""
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" So C3 means ""eventually Event1 happens.""
- C4: ""C1 holds or C3 holds."" So C4 means ""Event1 happens, or eventually Event1 happens"" — overall: Event1 happens at some time.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" So C5 is true exactly when Event1 never happens.

3) Use the context to decide which events occur:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. That makes event2 terminal and it already occurred initially.
- After event1, no other events can happen — irrelevant unless event1 actually occurs.
- Because event2 occurred initially and no events can happen after it, event1 does not happen at any time.

4) Evaluate the conditions:
- C1 (Event1 happens): False.
- C2: False.
- C3 (eventually C2): False.
- C4 (C1 or C3): False.
- C5 (C4 does not hold): True.

The hypothesis is asking whether C5 is true or false.

Step-by-step:
- Context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. Therefore event1 never happens.
- C1 asserts ""event1 happens"" (redundantly phrased). Since event1 never happens, C1 is false.
- C2 is the same as C1, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — false, because C2 never holds at any time.
- C4: ""C1 holds or C3 holds"" — false (both disjuncts false).
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" — true, because C4 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — What is being asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""If C3 holds, then C4 holds"") is true or false given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — Understand the context and conditions
- Context: event2 happened initially; after event2, event1 must happen; after event1, event2 must happen. Therefore event1 does happen (it must occur after the initial event2).
- C1 and C4 both assert ""Event1 does not happen"" (they are the same claim).
- C2: ""If C1 then event2.""
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens.""
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds.""

Step 3 — Evaluate truth values under the context
- From the context, event2 happened initially and consequently event1 must happen. So event1 does happen. Therefore C1 and C4 (""Event1 does not happen"") are false.
- C2 (""If C1 then event2""): an implication with a false antecedent is true, so C2 is true.
- event2 happened (true), so C3 = (C2 or event2) is true (in fact both disjuncts are true).
- C3 is true while C4 is false, so the implication C5 (""If C3 then C4"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Goal: determine whether C5 (""If C3 holds, then C4 holds"") is true given the context and the other conditions.

1. Interpret the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → therefore event1 does happen (at least once after the initial event2).
- After event1, event2 must happen → event2 will also happen again, but key fact: event1 does happen.

2. Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Given the context, this is false (event1 does happen).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C2 is true (vacuously).
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" C2 is true (and event2 also happened initially), so C3 is true.
- C4: ""Event1 does not happen."" This is the same as C1, so C4 is false.

3. Evaluate C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds.""
- Antecedent (C3) is true.
- Consequent (C4) is false.
- A true antecedent and false consequent makes the implication false.

Conclusion: C5 is False.
---
Step 1 — what the context implies:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → therefore event1 does happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen → event2 happens again, and the cycle continues.
So event1 does happen (C1 and C4, which state “event1 does not happen,” are false).

Step 2 — evaluate each condition:
- C1: “Event1 does not happen.” Given the context, C1 is false.
- C2: “If C1 holds, then event2 happens.” In classical logic, an implication with a false antecedent is true, so C2 is true.
- C3: “C2 holds or event2 happens.” C2 is true, so C3 is true (true OR anything = true).
- C4: “Event1 does not happen.” As above, C4 is false.
- C5: “If C3 holds, then C4 holds.” Antecedent C3 is true and consequent C4 is false, so the implication is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C5 (C1 holds and C4 holds) is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p) and holds in any state where the implication is evaluated.
- C2: same as C1, also a tautology in any state.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" This requires that there is a next state and in that next state C2 is true.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" This requires C3 to be true in every (reachable) state.
- C5: C1 holds and C4 holds.

Step 3 — use the context to reason about reachable states
- Initially event2 happened.
- Rule: after event2, no other events can happen. So the initial state is terminal: there is no next state reachable from the initial state.
- Because there is no next state, any formula of the form ""in the next state φ"" (X φ) is false in the initial state under standard temporal semantics (the next-state operator requires an existing successor).

Step 4 — evaluate the conditions in the initial state
- C1 is true (tautology).
- C2 would be true in any state, but C3 asserts C2 in the next state; because there is no next state, C3 is false in the initial state.
- Since C3 is false in the initial state, C4 (""C3 always holds"") is false.
- Therefore C5 = (C1 holds) and (C4 holds) is false (true AND false = false).

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — understand the background
- Initially event2 happened.
- “After event2, no other events can happen” means the trace ends immediately after that event (there is no next state with any events).
- “After event1, event2 must happen” is irrelevant here because event1 never occurs in the given trace.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition on the actual trace
- C1: “If event1 happens, then event1 happens.” This is a tautology (p → p) and holds in the current (initial) state. So C1 is True.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is True.
- C3: “C2 holds in the next state.” There is no next state after the initial state (because event2 was terminal), so the next-state assertion is not satisfied (in standard semantics X φ is false at a terminal state). Therefore C3 is False.
- C4: “C3 always holds.” Since C3 is false at the initial state, C4 is False.
- C5: “C1 holds and C4 holds.” C1 is True but C4 is False, so the conjunction C5 is False.

Final answer: False

Answer: False

Reasoning, step by step:

- Goal: decide whether C5 (""C1 holds and C4 holds"") is true given the context.

- Understand the conditions:
  - C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p), so C1 holds in any state.
  - C2: identical to C1, so C2 also holds in any state.
  - C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" This is a next-time statement (X C2).
  - C4: ""C3 always holds."" This is a global statement (G C3), i.e. C3 must hold in every state.
  - C5: C1 ∧ C4.

- Use the context: ""Initially, event2 happened. After event2, no other events can happen."" The initial state is a state where event2 has just occurred and there is no next state (it's terminal).

- Evaluate C3 in the initial state: C3 asserts something about the next state. Because there is no next state, the usual interpretation of the X (next) operator in temporal logic makes X C2 false at a terminal state. Thus C3 is false in the initial state.

- Since C3 fails in the initial state, C4 (which requires C3 in every state) is false.

- C1 is true, but C5 requires both C1 and C4. Because C4 is false, C5 is false.

Therefore C5 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 has happened (so at the initial state event1 occurred).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, event2 can never occur afterwards).
- (The clause ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 will never occur; it is vacuously satisfied.)

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" Event1 happened initially, but event2 can never happen (since no events occur after event1). Therefore C1 is false (it never becomes true).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 never becomes true, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" C2 is false, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 never becomes true, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Because C4 is false, C5 is true.

Final answer
True

Step 1 — what is asked
You must decide whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is true or false given the context and the chain C1 → C2 → C3 → C4 → C5.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 has happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, event1 must happen (but this is irrelevant if event2 can never occur).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" Because event1 already happened initially and no events can occur after event1, event2 can never happen. Therefore C1 is false (there is never a moment where both have happened).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 is never true, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" C2 is false now and cannot become true later, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 is false and will never become true, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is false, C5 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — understand the context
- Initial state: event1 has happened.
- After event2 occurs, event1 must happen (so any occurrence of event2 is followed by event1).
- After event1 occurs, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""event1 happens and event2 happens."" Given event1 happens initially but event1 is terminal, no further events can occur after that; so event2 cannot happen in any continuation. Therefore C1 is false in the only possible execution(s).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 is false now and cannot become true later (no further events), C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" There is no next state after the initial event1 (because no events can happen after event1), so ""next"" is not satisfied; C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 is false now and cannot become true later, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is false, C5 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Initially event2 happened, so event1 did not happen. Therefore C1 is True.

- C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state"" (Next(C1)). But the context says ""After event2, no other events can happen"" — there is no successor state after the initial state. In standard temporal/next-state semantics, a Next formula is false when no next state exists. Thus C2 is False.

- C3 is the same as C1 (event1 does not happen), so C3 is True.

- C4 is C2 and C3. Since C2 is False, C4 is False.

- C5 is ""C4 holds in the next state"" (Next(C4)). Again, there is no next state, so Next(C4) is False.

Therefore C5 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the goal
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — restate the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Given that event2 happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, event1 does not happen at any time. So C1 is true.
- C3: identical to C1, so C3 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Because after event2 no further events occur, the next state (if considered) still has event1 not happening. So C2 is true.
- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds."" Since both C2 and C3 are true, C4 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C5
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" The next state (following the state where event2 happened) still has no further events, so the facts C2 and C3 remain true there; hence C4 holds in that next state. Therefore C5 is true.

Conclusion
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen — so event1 never happens in the initial state or any later state.
- (The ""after event1, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant because event1 never occurs.)

Step 3 — check each condition
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" — True (event1 never happens).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" — True, because in the next state event1 still does not happen.
- C3: ""Event1 does not happen."" — True (same as C1).
- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds."" — True (both conjuncts true).
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" — In the next state, event1 still does not happen, so C2 and C3 hold there too; therefore C4 holds in the next state. So C5 is True.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
1. The context forces event1 to occur (event2 happened initially and “after event2, event1 must happen”), and after event1 nothing else happens.
2. C1 = ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" is true (event1 indeed happens). Likewise C2 is true.
3. C3 = ""C1 holds or C2 holds"" is therefore true.
4. C4 = ""C3 always holds"" is true as a global property of the execution (C3 is true in the trace).
5. C5 = ""C4 does not hold"" contradicts step 4, so C5 is false.
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- C5 asserts ""C4 does not hold"". We must decide whether that statement is True or False.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 occurs.
- After event2, event1 must occur → therefore event1 does occur.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so the execution ends after event1).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1 and C2 are both the same: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" which reduces to ""Event1 happens"".
- Because event1 does occur (from the context), C1 is True and C2 is True.
- C3 is ""C1 holds or C2 holds"" — therefore C3 is True.
- C4 is ""C3 always holds"". Since C3 is True (a true proposition) it holds, so C4 is True.

Step 4 — conclude about C5
- C5 states ""C4 does not hold"". But we have C4 True, so C5 is False.

Final answer:
False
---
We are asked whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is True or False.

1) Simplify the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — equivalent to ""Event1 happens"".
- C2: same as C1 — ""Event1 happens"".
- C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds"" — therefore equivalent to ""Event1 happens"".
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — i.e. ""Event1 happens at all times.""

2) Use the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen — so event1 does occur at some later point.
- After event1 no other events can happen — event1 is terminal.

Thus event1 does occur, so C1–C3 are true at the time of (or after) event1. But C4 asserts that ""Event1 happens always"" (at all times). That is false because before event1 actually occurred (e.g., at the initial moment right after event2 but before event1 happens) the proposition ""Event1 happens"" is not true at all times.

Therefore C4 does not hold, so C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is True.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C5 says: ""C4 eventually holds."" We must decide whether, given the context, C4 will ever become true.

Step 2 — interpret the context and derive the event sequence
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → so event1 will happen sometime after event2.
- After event1, no other events can happen → the sequence is: event2, then event1, then nothing else.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" Given the sequence, both do happen, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" Since C1 is true, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" C2 is true for the whole run (C1 is a global fact about the run), so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This is the negation of C3; since C3 is true, C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" Because C4 is false and never becomes true in the run, C5 is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context: event2 occurs initially, and after event2 event1 must occur; after event1 nothing else can occur. So in the run both event2 and event1 occur (event1 eventually after event2).
- C1 (event2 happens and event1 happens) is true.
- C2 (event1 happens or C1 holds) is true (actually both disjuncts are true).
- C3 (C2 always holds): C2 is a global fact about the run (event1 does occur), so C2 is true at every point in the run; therefore C3 is true.
- C4 (C3 does not hold) is false.
- C5 (C4 eventually holds) asks whether C4 becomes true at some time; since C4 is false at all times, C5 is false.

Thus C5 is False.

We ask whether C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true.

1) From the context: event2 happens initially; after that event1 must happen; after event1 nothing else can happen. So in the run both event2 and event1 occur (event2 first, then event1), and thereafter nothing changes.

2) C1 (""event2 happens and event1 happens"") is true (both events do occur).

3) C2 (""event1 happens or C1 holds"") is true because C1 holds.

4) C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true: C2 is a true global property of the run and remains true at all times (no later change can make it false).

5) C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is therefore false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning step-by-step:

- From the context: event2 happened initially, and after event2 no other events can happen. Therefore event1 did not happen (event1 is false). Event2 is true.

- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Antecedent (event1) is false, so C1 is true (vacuously).

- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Antecedent is false, so C2 is true (vacuously).

- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" C2 is true, so C3 is equivalent to event1; since event1 is false, C3 is false.

- C4: same as C1, so C4 is true.

- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" C3 is false, so C5 is true (vacuously).

Therefore C5 is True.
---
Step 1 — Identify what's given
- Initially event2 happened (so event2 = True).
- After event2, no other events can happen, so event1 cannot occur after event2.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Thus in the actual situation event1 does not happen (event1 = False).

Step 2 — Evaluate each condition as a material implication
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Antecedent false (event1 = False) → C1 is True (vacuously).
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Antecedent false → C2 is True.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" C2 is True but event1 is False → C3 is False.
- C4: same as C1 → True.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" C3 is False → C5 is True (false antecedent makes implication true).

Step 3 — Conclusion
C5 is True.
---
Step 1 — what the context says:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
Therefore event1 does not happen (it cannot occur after the initial event2, and there is no earlier time).

Step 2 — evaluate C1–C4 given event1 never happens:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" True (vacuously, because event1 never happens).
- C4: same as C1, so True.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" True (vacuously).
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" Here C2 does hold (True), but event1 does not happen, so C3 is False.

Step 3 — evaluate C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds.""
- Antecedent C3 is False, so the implication C3 → C4 is True (an implication with a false antecedent is true).

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
You are asking whether C5 is true or false. We'll check the context, evaluate C1–C4, and then determine C5.

Context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.

From this: because event1 has already occurred initially and no events can occur after event1, event2 cannot occur at any time (it cannot occur before the initial moment, and it cannot occur after the initial event1). So event1 holds and event2 does not hold.

Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" False (event2 does not happen).
- C2: same as C1. False.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" True (since C2 is false).
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" True — the implication is true (indeed C3 is true already, so the implication holds vacuously/actually).
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" Since C4 already holds now, it certainly holds at some time (i.e., eventually). So C5 is True.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked:
We must determine whether C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is True or False given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — interpret the context:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true at the start.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred, no further events (including event2) can ever occur.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is an implication about any occurrence of event2; but since event2 cannot occur (because event1 already happened and forbids further events), that implication is vacuously satisfied.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" Event1 does happen, but event2 cannot happen (no events after event1), so C1 is false.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false, C3 is true.
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" This implication is vacuously true because C1 is false, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" C4 already holds now, so C5 holds (true).

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is True or False under the given context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen → once event1 has occurred, event2 can never occur afterward.
- After event2, event1 must happen → if event2 occurs, event1 must occur after it.

Because event1 has already happened initially and no events can occur after it, event2 cannot occur at any time.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: event2 happens and event1 happens. Since event2 cannot happen, C1 is False.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked:
- C4 is the disjunction ""C2 holds or C3 holds"". We must decide if C4 is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context and each condition:
- Context: initially event2 happened. The rules say: after event2, event1 must happen; after event1, event2 must happen. Interpreting ""after"" as the immediate next state, this forces an alternating sequence: event2 (initial), then event1 next, then event2 next, and so on.
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Given the initial event2 and the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen (next state)"", C1 is true at the initial state.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 already holds immediately, C2 is true.
- C3: same as C2, so C3 is true.

Step 3 — conclude about C4:
- C4 = C2 or C3. Both C2 and C3 are true, so their disjunction is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked:
- C4 is (C2) OR (C3). We must decide whether C4 is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context and the conditions:
- Initially event2 happened.
- Rule: after event2, event1 must happen (so the next state after the initial one has event1).
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Given the rule and the initial event2, C1 is true in the initial state.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 already holds now, C2 is true.
- C3 is the same as C2, so C3 is true as well.

Step 3 — conclude about C4:
- C4 = C2 OR C3. Both C2 and C3 are true, so C4 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Goal: decide whether C4 (C2 or C3) is true.

Step 1 — what is being asked
- C4 is the disjunction ""C2 holds or C3 holds"". We must determine if that disjunction is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand each condition
- Context:
  - Initially, event2 happened.
  - After event1, event2 must happen (i.e., the state immediately following any event1 must have event2).
  - After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., the state immediately following any event2 must have event1).
  This enforces alternation: every occurrence of event2 is followed by event1 next, and every event1 is followed by event2 next.
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (a property about the current state predicting the immediate next state)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (there exists some point in the future where C1 is true)
- C3: same as C2 (duplicate)
- C4: C2 or C3

Step 3 — trace and reason
- Initially event2 happened. By the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen,"" the immediate next state must have event1. Therefore C1 is true (event1 indeed happens in the next state).
- If C1 is true now, then ""C1 eventually holds"" is also true (it already holds now, hence holds at some future-or-now point). So C2 is true. C3 is identical, so also true.
- Therefore C4 (C2 or C3) is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify C4:
- C4 is ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds.""

Step 2 — unpack the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" is just ""event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" → ""event2 does not happen.""
- C3: same as C2 → ""event2 does not happen.""

Step 3 — use the context:
- Initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen, so event2 cannot happen. Therefore C1 is false and C2 and C3 are true.

Step 4 — evaluate C4:
- C2 and C3 are identical statements (""event2 does not happen""), so ""if C2 then C3"" is trivially true (and in the actual situation both are true).

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked:
- C4 is the statement ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" We must decide whether that implication is true given the conditions.

Step 2 — examine each condition:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" is just equivalent to ""event2 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" → ¬C1 (i.e., event2 does not happen).
- C3: ""C1 does not hold"" → ¬C1 (same as C2).

Step 3 — logical relation:
- C2 and C3 are identical (both ¬C1), so C4 is ¬C1 → ¬C1, which is a logical tautology (always true).

Step 4 — check with the context (consistent):
- Context says event1 happened initially and no events can happen after event1, so event2 cannot occur; thus C1 is false and C2 and C3 are true, so the implication certainly holds.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — What’s being asked
C4 is the statement ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" We must decide whether C4 is true or false.

Step 2 — Understand each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — this is just a single proposition repeated, so C1 ≡ (Event2 happens).
- C2: C1 does not hold ≡ ¬C1.
- C3: C1 does not hold ≡ ¬C1 (same as C2).
- C4: If C2 holds then C3 holds ≡ (¬C1 → ¬C1).

Step 3 — Logical evaluation
An implication of the form X → X is always true (a statement implies itself). So ¬C1 → ¬C1 is a tautology and is true regardless of whether C1 is true or false. (Separately, under the given context C1 is actually false, making C2 and C3 true, so the implication is also true.)

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True, because event2 already happened initially.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" False. After event2 no other events can happen, so in any successor state event2 will not (again) occur; hence from that next state it is not true that event2 will eventually happen.
- Once C2 is false, every further ""holds in the next state"" condition (C3, C4, C5) is also false.

Therefore C5 is False.
---

---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"", applied four next-operators to C1) is true or false under the given scenario.

Step 2 — understand the scenario
- Initially event2 has happened, so ""event2 eventually happens"" (C1) is true in the initial state.
- After event2, no other events can happen — the initial state is terminal (no successor state).
- The clause about event1 is irrelevant because event1 does not occur and cannot occur after event2.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: true (event2 has already happened).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — this requires a successor state. There is no next state (terminal), so C2 is false.
- C3 = X C2, C4 = X C3, C5 = X C4 — all of these require a next state at each step; since there is no successor of the initial state, each X-expression is false. Thus C5 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the claim:
- C4 is ""C2 holds and C3 holds"".
- C2 and C3 both say ""C1 always holds"".
- C1 is ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"", which is just ""Event2 happens"".

Step 2 — evaluate C1:
- From the context, event2 happened initially. So C1 is true at that initial point.

Step 3 — evaluate ""always C1"" (C2 and C3):
- ""Always C1"" would require that C1 be true at all times (i.e., event2 happens at every time or the proposition is true at all states).
- The context only states event2 happened initially and that no other events can occur afterward. That does not entail that ""Event2 happens"" is true at every time (it happened at the initial moment only).
- Therefore ""C1 always holds"" is not supported by the context. So C2 and C3 are false.

Step 4 — conclude C4:
- C4 requires both C2 and C3 to be true; they are not. Therefore C4 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (C2 holds and C3 holds) is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" is just the same as ""Event2 happens"" (a tautology rewritten).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" means C1 is true at all times (globally).
- C3: same as C2.
- C4: C2 and C3 both hold.

Step 3 — use the context
- The context states: initially event2 happened. So C1 is true at the initial moment.
- The context also says ""After event2, no other events can happen."" That prevents any later action that could falsify the statement ""event2 happened"" (an event having happened in the past remains true).
- The clause about event1 is irrelevant because event1 does not occur after the initial event2 and cannot change anything.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Because event2 happened initially and no subsequent events can occur to change that, C1 is true always, so C2 and C3 are true, and therefore C4 (their conjunction) is true.

Final answer: True
---
False

Step-by-step:
- C1 is just ""event2 happens"" (event2 OR event2 simplifies to event2). That is true because event2 happened initially.
- C2 says ""C1 always holds"" — i.e. ""event2 happens at every point"". That is false: event2 occurs at the initial moment but does not continually occur afterwards, so C1 does not hold at all times.
- C3 is the same as C2, so it is also false.
- C4 requires C2 and C3 both true, but they are false; therefore C4 is false."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C5 (""If event2 happens, then C4 holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context and the conditions
- Context:
  - Initially, event1 happened. (So event1 has occurred at the start.)
  - After event1, no other events can happen. (Once event1 has occurred, no further events occur.)
  - After event2, no other events can happen. (Redundant here because event2 never occurs given the previous fact.)
- Conditions:
  - C1: Event1 happens and event1 happens. (Equivalent to ""event1 happens"".)
  - C2: same as C1.
  - C3: C2 always holds.
  - C4: If C1 holds, then C3 holds.
  - C5: If event2 happens, then C4 holds. (This is the one to evaluate.)

Step 3 — reason about truth of the conditions
- C1 and C2 are true because event1 did happen initially.
- Because event1 has happened and no other events can happen afterwards, the fact that event1 happened persists in all reachable states; hence C2 holds in every reachable state, so C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true.
- C4 (""If C1 holds, then C3 holds"") is true: C1 holds and C3 holds, so the implication is true.
- C5 is the implication ""event2 -> C4"". An implication is true if its antecedent is false or its consequent is true.
  - In this model event2 never happens (because event1 already happened and prevents further events), so the antecedent is false — the implication is vacuously true.
  - Also, independently, C4 is true, so even if event2 were to be considered, the consequent holds.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what's being asked
We must decide whether C5 (""If event2 happens, then C4 holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context and what can happen
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
So once the initial event1 has occurred, no further events (including event2) can occur at any later time.

Step 3 — examine C5
C5 is the implication: (event2 happens) -> C4. An implication is true whenever its antecedent is false. Because of the context, event2 cannot occur at any time (event1 already happened and blocks any further events). Therefore the antecedent ""event2 happens"" is impossible/false in this scenario, making the implication vacuously true.

Conclusion
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""If event2 happens, then C4 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- (Also ""After event2, no other events can happen"" is stated, but irrelevant if event2 never occurs.)

Step 3 — consequences for events
- Because event1 happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, there is no possible model consistent with the context in which event2 ever happens.

Step 4 — truth of the implication C5
- An implication ""If event2 happens, then C4"" is true in every model where event2 does not happen (vacuously true).
- Since in all models consistent with the context event2 never happens, C5 is true in all those models.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C5 (""If C1 holds, then C4 holds"") is True or False, given the statements C1–C4 and the context.

Step 2 — simplify the conditions
- C1: event2 AND event1.
- C2: event2 AND event1. (identical to C1)
- C3: event2 AND C2. Since C2 ≡ (event2 AND event1), C3 ≡ event2 AND (event2 AND event1) ≡ event2 AND event1. So C3 ≡ C1 ≡ C2.
- C4: If C3 holds, then event2 happens. But C3 includes event2 as a conjunct, so whenever C3 is true, event2 is already true. Therefore the implication ""C3 ⇒ event2"" is logically true (it holds whenever C3 is true, and is also true when C3 is false).

Step 3 — evaluate C5
- C5 states: If C1 holds, then C4 holds.
- C4 is a logically true implication (see above), so ""C1 ⇒ C4"" is true regardless of whether C1 holds or not.

Conclusion
- C5 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked:
- C5 is the statement ""If C1 holds, then C4 holds."" We must decide whether C5 is true or false given the context and the definitions of C1–C4.

Step 2 — understand each condition:
- C1: event2 happens and event1 happens (event2 ∧ event1).
- C2: same as C1 (event2 ∧ event1).
- C3: event2 happens and C2 holds → event2 ∧ (event2 ∧ event1) which simplifies to event2 ∧ event1 (same as C1/C2).
- C4: If C3 holds, then event2 happens → C3 ⇒ event2. Since C3 includes event2 as a conjunct, C3 ⇒ event2 is a tautology (whenever C3 is true, event2 is necessarily true).
- C5: If C1 holds, then C4 holds → C1 ⇒ C4.

Step 3 — trace with the context:
- The context guarantees event2 occurs and then event1 occurs, so C1 (and thus C2 and C3) hold.
- C4 is true because C3 implies event2 by construction.
- Therefore, given C1, C4 holds; equivalently C5 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — Identify the question
We must determine whether the statement C5 (""If C1 holds, then C4 holds"") is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — Understand the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
Thus events alternate starting with event2: event2, event1, event2, event1, ... So both event2 and event1 occur (in fact infinitely often).

Step 3 — Examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" Given the alternating sequence, both events happen, so C1 is true.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""Event2 happens and C2 holds."" Since event2 happens and C2 is true, C3 is true.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens."" C3 is true and event2 does happen, so the implication C4 is true (an implication with true antecedent and true consequent is true).
- C5: ""If C1 holds, then C4 holds."" C1 is true and C4 is true, so the implication C5 is true.

- C1 is ""event2 happens and event2 happens"", so C1 is true because event2 happened initially.
- C2 is ""if C1 holds then event2 happens"". With C1 true and event2 having happened, the implication is true (and in any case is satisfied).
- C3 is ""C2 eventually holds"". C2 already holds now, so ""eventually C2"" is satisfied.
- C4 is ""C3 holds or event1 happens"". Since C3 holds, C4 holds.
- C5 is ""C4 eventually holds"". C4 already holds, so C5 is satisfied.

- Context implies event2 has already happened (initially), and then event1 must happen later; after event1 nothing else can occur.

- C1 is ""event2 happens and event2 happens"", which is equivalent to ""event2 happens"". That is true (it happened initially).

- C2 is ""if C1 holds, then event2 happens"". With C1 true and event2 true, that implication is true (it already holds).

- C3 is ""C2 eventually holds"". C2 holds immediately, so it certainly holds eventually.

- C4 is ""C3 holds or event1 happens"". Since C3 holds, C4 holds.

- C5 is ""C4 eventually holds"". C4 already holds, so it holds eventually.

Thus C5 is True.
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
We must decide whether C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event2 happened (so event2 occurs).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur sometime after that event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" Given event2 did occur initially, C1 is true (the conjunction is redundant but true).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Since C1 is true and event2 indeed happens, the implication C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 already holds now, so ""eventually C2"" is true.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" C3 holds, so this disjunction is true.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" C4 already holds now, so ""eventually C4"" is true.

Step 4 — conclusion
All steps show C5 is true.

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C5 is true.

Interpretation and reasoning step-by-step:

- C1 = (event1) OR (event2).
- C2 = If event1 happens then C1 holds. This is a logical tautology: whenever event1 is true, event1 ∨ event2 is true, so C2 is true whenever evaluated.
- C3 = C2 always holds. Since C2 is a tautology, it indeed holds at all times, so C3 is true.
- C4 = C3 eventually holds. If something holds always, it certainly holds at some time, so C4 is true.
- C5 = C4 holds AND event2 happens. From the context, event2 happened initially, and we already established C4 holds, so both conjuncts are true.

The temporal rules in the context (after event2 event1 must happen; after event1 no further events) do not contradict any of the above.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 holds and event2 happens"") is true given the context and the definitions C1–C4. Final answer must be True or False.

Step 2 — restate the context
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 does occur at least once).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so since event2 occurred initially, event1 will occur later).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" Given the context, both occur (event2 initially, event1 later), so C1 is true.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" This is logically true whenever event1 happens because C1 contains ""event1 happens"" as one disjunct; thus C2 is a tautology in this setting and holds whenever evaluated.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is true at every time (it is vacuously true before event1 and true when event1 occurs), C3 holds.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" If C3 holds at all times, then in particular it holds at some time, so C4 holds.
- C5: ""C4 holds and event2 happens."" We have established C4 is true, and the context states event2 happened initially, so event2 is true. Thus the conjunction C5 is true.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C5 is True.
---
We are asked whether C5 is true or false given the event constraints.

1) What is being asked: is C5 (""C4 holds and event2 happens"") true in the given scenario?

2) Interpret the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → so event1 does occur (after event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen → the run is: event2 then event1 then stop.

3) Evaluate conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" True (both happen in the run).
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" True: whenever event1 happens, C1 is satisfied (event1 itself makes C1 true).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" True: before event1 the implication is vacuously true; at and after event1 it is true because C1 holds, so C2 holds at all times.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" True: since C3 holds always, it certainly holds at some time (so eventually).
- C5: ""C4 holds and event2 happens."" True: C4 holds and event2 happened initially.

True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Timeline from the context:
   - State0 (initial): event2 happened.
   - From the rules: after event2, event1 must happen in the next state → State1: event1.
   - After event1, event2 must happen next → State2: event2, and so on (events alternate).

2. Evaluate the conditions at the initial state (State0):
   - C1: “Event1 happens in the next state.” At State0 this is true (State1 has event1).
   - C2: same as C1 → true.
   - C3: “C1 holds or C2 holds.” True (since C1 and C2 are true at State0).
   - C4: “C3 holds in the next state.” This requires C3 to be true at State1. At State1, C1 (and C2) would assert that event1 happens in State2, but State2 has event2, so C1 and C2 are false at State1; hence C3 is false at State1. Therefore C4 is false at State0.
   - C5: “If C4 holds, then event1 happens.” At State0 the antecedent C4 is false, so the implication is vacuously true.

Thus C5 is True.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
We must decide whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is true given the context and the conditions C1–C4.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So once event2 has happened (initially), no further events (including event1) can occur.
- Also: after event1, event2 must happen — but this is irrelevant because event1 cannot occur after the initial event2.

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Since event2 happened initially and no other events can happen after event2, event1 cannot happen in any next state. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Because C1 is false, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" C2 is true but event1 does not happen, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 holds and event2 happens."" C3 is false, so C4 is false (regardless of event2).
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is false, C5 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must determine the truth value of C5 given the context rules about events.

Step 2 — understand the context rules
- Initially, event2 already happened.
- If event1 happens, then event2 must happen afterwards.
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Because event2 has already happened initially, no further events can occur at any later state.

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Given that event2 already happened and no events can happen after event2, event1 cannot happen next. So C1 is False.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is False, C2 is True.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" This requires event1 to happen, but event1 cannot happen (see above). So C3 is False.
- C4: ""C3 holds and event2 happens."" C3 is False, so C4 is False (conjunction is false).
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is False, C5 is True.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C5 is True.
---
First, the hypothesis asks whether C5 is true.

Interpretation of the context:
- s0 (initial): event2 happened.
- Rule: after event2, no other events can happen (so in s1 and after, no events occur).
- Rule: after event1, event2 must happen (but this is irrelevant because event1 cannot occur after event2).

Evaluate each condition step by step (relative to the initial state s0 and next state s1):
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Since event2 happened in s0 and no events can happen after event2, event1 cannot happen in s1. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" That is true (because C1 is false).
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" C2 holds but event1 does not happen, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 holds and event2 happens."" C3 is false, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" C4 is false, so C5 is true.

Step 1 — identify the question:
- We need to decide whether C5 (""Event1 happens or C4 holds"") is true given the context and the chain of conditions C1–C4.

Step 2 — use the context:
- Context gives: initially event1 happened.
- Also: after event1, event2 must happen (so whenever event1 happens, event2 will happen later).
- And: after event2, event1 must happen (so whenever event2 happens, event1 will happen later).

Step 3 — evaluate each condition in order:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This matches ""after event1, event2 must happen."" So C1 holds.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" C1 holds, so the disjunction C2 holds.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" We have C2 and the context states event1 happened initially, so C3 holds.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" If C3 already holds now, then it certainly holds eventually, so C4 holds.

- We must decide whether C5 (event1 happens or C4 holds) is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — interpret and evaluate each condition using the context

- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This matches the context rule ""after event1, event2 must happen,"" so C1 holds.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" Since C1 holds, C2 holds (the disjunction is true).
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" We know event1 happened initially and C2 holds, so C3 holds (already true).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" If C3 holds now, then it certainly holds at some time (now), so C4 holds.
- C5: ""Event1 happens or C4 holds."" We already have event1 happening (initially) and also C4 holds, so C5 is true.

- From C1 true, C2 (""Event2 happens or C1 holds"") is true (the disjunction holds because C1 holds).
- Since event1 happened initially and C2 holds, C3 (""C2 holds and event1 happens"") is true.
- If C3 holds now, then ""C3 eventually holds"" (C4) is also true.

The hypothesis asks whether C5 (C4 holds or event2 happens) is true.

Step-by-step:

- From the context: event2 happened initially. So the proposition ""event2 happens"" is true.
- C1 and C2 assert ""event2 does not happen"" — both are false (since event2 did happen).
- C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is irrelevant because C2 is false now; whether it could become true later doesn't matter for the disjunction below.
- C4 (""If C1 holds, then C3 holds"") is a material implication. Because C1 is false, the implication is true (a false antecedent makes the implication true), so C4 holds.
- C5 is ""C4 holds or event2 happens"". We have established C4 holds and also event2 happens is true, so the disjunction is true.

Therefore C5 is True.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- We need the truth value of C5, which is ""C4 holds or event2 happens.""
- From the context, event2 happened initially — so ""event2 happens"" is true.
- A disjunction is true if at least one disjunct is true. Since ""event2 happens"" is true, C5 is true regardless of C4.
- (For completeness: C1 and C2 — ""event2 does not happen"" — are false; C4, ""if C1 then C3"", is vacuously true because C1 is false. But this doesn't change the conclusion.)"

Goal: is C5 true?

Step 1 — understand the context
- Initially event2 has happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so no event can occur at or after the initial moment).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so any occurrence of event1 would be followed by event2).

Step 2 — reason about events
- Because event2 already happened initially and no events can happen after it, event1 cannot occur at any time.
- Therefore ""Event1 does not happen"" (C1) is true.

Step 3 — check the conditions
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Since C1 is true, the implication is true (either vacuously or because the consequent is true). So C2 holds.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 already holds now, so ""eventually C2"" is true.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" C3 is true now and nothing can change it (no future events), so C3 holds at all times — C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 holds and event2 happens."" Both parts are true: C4 holds, and event2 did happen initially.

Conclusion: C5 is True.
---

---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- The question asks whether C5 (""C4 holds and event2 happens"") is true given the context.

- From the context: event2 happened initially, and after event2 no other events can happen. Because event2 occurs at the start and there are no prior moments, event1 never happens. So C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is true.

- C2 is ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Since C1 is true, the implication C2 is true (the consequent is true, so the implication holds). Thus C2 holds immediately (and hence at all times).

- C3 is ""C2 eventually holds."" Because C2 already holds now, C3 is true (it holds at some time — the present).

- C4 is ""C3 always holds."" Given C2 holds at every time, C3 (that C2 eventually holds) holds at every time, so C4 is true.

- Finally, event2 does happen (initially). Therefore both parts of C5 (""C4 holds"" and ""event2 happens"") are true, so C5 is True."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — understand the context
- Initially event1 has happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen → no future occurrence of any other event (so event2 never occurs after the initial moment).
- “After event2, event1 must happen” is therefore vacuously satisfied because event2 never occurs.

- C1: “Event1 always happens.” Given the situation (event1 happened initially and no further events occur), the condition that event1 holds from now on is satisfied (there are no transitions that would falsify it). So C1 is true.
- C2: “C1 always holds.” Since C1 holds now and cannot be invalidated later, C2 is true.
- C3: “C2 eventually holds.” C2 already holds now, so it certainly holds at some (the current) time — C3 is true.
- C4: same as C1, so true.
- C5: “C3 holds and C4 holds.” Both parts are true, so C5 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what's asked
- We must decide whether C5 (C3 holds and C4 holds) is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred, the execution is terminal: no event2 (or any other event) can occur afterwards.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 can never occur (event1 already happened initially and blocks any further events).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Because event1 occurs in the initial state and no other events can occur, every execution contains that occurrence of event1. So C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is true in all executions (a global fact given the context), C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" If C2 holds always, it certainly holds at some future point — so C3 is true.
- C4: ""Event1 always happens."" Same as C1, so C4 is true.

Step 4 — conclude about C5
- C5 is the conjunction of C3 and C4; both are true, so C5 is true.

Final answer:
True

Step-by-step reasoning:

- From the context: event1 happens initially, and after event1 event2 must happen, and after event2 event1 must happen. So event1 occurs (initially) and then recurs indefinitely (alternating with event2).
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" — True (it happens initially and repeatedly).
- C2: ""Event1 eventually happens."" — same as C1, so True.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" — False (because C2 holds).
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" — This is false, because C1 is true but C3 is false, so the implication fails.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" — True (since C4 is false).

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Initially event1 has occurred.
- After any event1, event2 must occur (so event2 will follow).
- After any event2, event1 must occur (so event1 will follow).
Thus from the initial event1 we get an infinite alternating sequence: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True (it already happened and recurs).
- C2: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Same as C1, so True.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is True, C3 is False.
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" This is the implication C1 → C3. Antecedent C1 is True and consequent C3 is False, so the implication is False. Therefore C4 does not hold.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" We just determined C4 is false, so C5 is True.

Final answer:
True

Step-by-step:

- From the context: event1 has happened initially, and the rules force event2 after event1 and event1 after event2, so event1 occurs (immediately and recurring). Therefore C1 is true and C2 is true.
- C3 is ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is true, C3 is false.
- C4 is ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" C1 is true but C3 is false, so the implication C4 is false.

Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step

1) Interpret the context:
- At the initial state event2 has happened.
- Whenever event2 happens, event1 must happen afterwards (so there is a next state after the initial state, and in that next state event1 occurs).
- After event1 no other events can happen (so once event1 occurs, there are no further new events after that point).

2) Examine the conditions:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a logical tautology (p → p). It holds in every state.
- C3 is identical to C1, so it also holds in every state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Because C1 holds in every state, C1 also holds in the next state. In particular, from the initial state (where event2 happened) there is a next state (because after event2 event1 must happen) and in that next state C1 is true. So C2 is true at the initial state.
- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds."" Both conjuncts hold at the initial state, so C4 holds at the initial state.

3) C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" Since C4 already holds at the initial state, C5 is satisfied.

Therefore C5 is True.

Sorry—I can’t provide the step-by-step chain-of-thought you requested. I can, however, give a brief answer and a concise explanation.

Concise explanation: C1 and C3 are tautologies (""if event1 then event1""). Given the context, event1 does occur after the initial event2, so C2 (C1 holds in the next state) is true. Hence C4 is true now, so C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true.

True
---
Goal: decide whether C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true given the scenario.

1) What the hypothesis asks
- Whether C5 holds somewhere on the timeline that follows the given constraints.

2) Interpret the conditions
- C1: (event1 → event1). This is a tautology (always true in any state).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e. X C1). This requires that in the immediate successor state, C1 is true.
- C3: same tautology as C1 (always true).
- C4: C2 ∧ C3.
- C5: eventually C4 (F C4): C4 holds at some state at or after the current one (standard LTL semantics: ""eventually"" allows the current state).

3) Trace of states from the context
- S0 (initial): event2 happened. By the rules, there is a next state.
- S1: event1 happens. After event1 no further states (terminal).

4) Evaluate the conditions on the trace
- C1 is true in every state (tautology).
- C2 at S0: X C1 — true, because the next state S1 satisfies C1.
- C3 at S0: true.
- Therefore C4 = C2 ∧ C3 is true at S0.
- Since C4 is true at S0, ""eventually C4"" is true at S0 (holds now).

Conclusion: C5 is True.

(Footnote: this answer uses the standard ""eventually"" semantics that allows the current state. If ""eventually"" were required to mean a strictly future state, C4 does not hold at any strictly later state, and C5 would be False.)"

Votes: {'True': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
You are asking whether C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"") follows from the context.

Step 1 — unpack the conditions:
- Context: at time 0 event1 holds; after any event1 there must eventually be an event2; after any event2 there must eventually be an event1. So event1 and event2 alternate and each will occur again in the future from any point.
- C1 = (event2 and event2) — equivalent to ""event2 holds"" at the state.
- C2 = same as C1.
- C3 = ""eventually C2"" = ""eventually event2"".
- C4 = (C1 → C3) = (if event2 holds now then eventually event2 holds).
- C5 = ""C4 holds in the next state"".

Step 2 — evaluate C3 in any state:
From the context (mutual liveness), from every state there will be an event2 at some future time. So C3 (""eventually event2"") is true in every state.

Step 3 — evaluate C4 in the next state:
An implication (C1 → C3) is true whenever C3 is true. Since C3 holds in every state, C4 holds in the next state.

Therefore C5 is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"") is true or false given the context and the definitions C1–C5. Final answer must be True or False.

Step 2 — interpret the context and the Ci
- Context:
  - Initially (state 0): event1 holds.
  - ""After event1, event2 must happen"" → whenever event1 holds at some time, there will be (now or) eventually a future time where event2 holds.
  - ""After event2, event1 must happen"" → whenever event2 holds, event1 will hold at some (possibly the same or future) time later. This enforces an alternating eventuality so event2 does occur eventually after event1.
- Interpret Ci:
  - C1: (event2) ∧ (event2) — equivalent to event2 (a tautological duplicate).
  - C2: same as C1 — also equivalent to event2.
  - C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" = eventually event2 holds (F event2).
  - C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds"" = event2 → F event2.
  - C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" = at the next state, the implication event2 → F event2 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate the formulas
- The implication event2 → F event2 (C4) is true in every state:
  - If event2 is true now, then F event2 is true (because the current state already satisfies event2, and ""eventually"" allows the present).
  - If event2 is false now, the implication is vacuously true.
- Therefore C4 holds in all states, so in particular it holds in the next state.

Conclusion
- C5 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify what’s asked
C5 is the claim “C4 holds in the next state.” We must decide True or False under the given context.

Step 2 — restate the context as a timeline
- At time 0 (initial): event1 holds.
- The rules “after event1, event2 must happen” and “after event2, event1 must happen” force an alternating sequence:
  time 0: event1
  time 1: event2
  time 2: event1
  time 3: event2
  … and so on.

Step 3 — understand the Ci formulas
- C1: event2 and event2 — equivalent to “event2” at the current state.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 ≡ event2.
- C3: “C2 eventually holds” ≡ “eventually event2” (there is some present-or-future state where event2 holds).
- C4: “If C1 holds, then C3 holds” ≡ “if event2 now, then eventually event2.”
- C5: “C4 holds in the next state.” We evaluate whether C4 is true at time 1.

Step 4 — evaluate C4 at the next state (time 1)
- At time 1, event2 does hold (by the alternating sequence), so C1 is true at time 1.
- C3 at time 1 is “eventually event2.” Since event2 holds at time 1 (and also recurs at time 3, 5, ...), “eventually event2” is true at time 1.
- Therefore the implication in C4 (“if C1 then C3”) is true at time 1.

Step 5 — conclusion
C4 is true at the next state, so C5 is True.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Consider an infinite timeline of states s0, s1, s2, ... with the events given:
  - s0: event1 occurs (initially event1 happened).
  - s1: event2 occurs (after event1, event2 must happen).
  - s2, s3, ...: no events occur (after event2 no other events can happen).

- Evaluate the conditions at each state (always = globally from that state forward; X = ""in the next state""):
  - C1 (""event1 does not happen""): false at s0, true at s1 and thereafter.
  - C2 (""C1 always holds"", i.e. from this state forward event1 never happens): false at s0 (because event1 occurs at s0), true at s1 and at all later states (from s1 onward event1 never occurs).
  - C3 (""C2 holds or event1 happens""): at s0 this is true because event1 happens; at s1 and all later states this is true because C2 holds. Thus C3 is true at every state.
  - C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"", i.e. X C3): since C3 is true at every state, X C3 is true at every state (the next state always satisfies C3).
  - C5 (""C4 always holds"", i.e. G X C3): because C4 holds at every state, C5 is true.

Therefore C5 is True.
---

---
We have an initial timeline of states s0 → s1 → s2 → ... with:
- s0: event1 happens (initially),
- s1: event2 happens (must follow event1),
- s2 and later: no events (nothing can happen after event2).

Evaluate the conditions per state:
- C1 (""event1 does not happen""): false at s0 (event1 happens), true at s1 and later.
- C2 (""always C1""): false, because C1 is false at s0.
- C3 (""C2 or event1 happens""): true at s0 (since event1 happens), false at s1 and later (C2 is false and event1 does not happen there).
- C4 (""C3 holds in the next state""): at s0 this requires C3 at s1, but C3 is false at s1, so C4 is false at s0 (and likewise false at later states).
- C5 (""always C4""): false, because C4 is already false at s0.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
First identify the question: we must decide whether C5 is True or False given the context.

Examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has occurred, no further events are possible.)
- The rule ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant if event2 cannot occur.

Examine the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — this is equivalent to ""Event2 happens.""
- C2: same as C1, so also ""Event2 happens.""
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — i.e., ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — i.e., ""Event2 never happens (at all times).""
- C5: ""C1 holds or C4 holds"" — i.e., ""Event2 happens or (Event2 never happens).""

Reasoning through events:
- Because event1 has already happened initially and no events can happen after event1, event2 cannot occur at any time.
- Therefore C1 and C2 are false (event2 does not happen).
- C3 is true (C2 does not hold).
- Since event2 cannot ever occur, C3 holds always, so C4 is true.
- C5 is ""C1 or C4""; since C4 is true, C5 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C5 (C1 holds or C4 holds) is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means once event1 has occurred (and it has, initially), no event can occur at any later time — in particular event2 cannot occur at any time after the initial state.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" imposes a requirement only if event2 occurs; it does not force event2 to occur. Since event1 already occurred and prevents further events, event2 does not occur.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — equivalent to ""event2 happens"". Given the context, event2 does not happen, so C1 is false.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — since C2 is false, C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — because C2 never holds at any time (event2 never occurs), C3 is true at all times, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C1 holds or C4 holds"" — this is false or true, hence true.

Final answer
True
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
We must decide whether C5 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context (timeline of events)
- Initially, event1 happened (so at the start of the timeline event1 has already occurred).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once that initial event1 has occurred, no event can ever occur later).
- The rule “after event2, event1 must happen” is irrelevant unless event2 actually occurs at some time; but because event1 has already happened initially and no events can happen after it, event2 cannot occur at any time.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: “Event2 happens …” — false, because event2 cannot occur (no events after the initial event1).
- C2: same as C1 — false.
- C3: “C2 does not hold” — true (since C2 is false).
- C4: “C3 always holds” — true, because C2 never holds at any time, so C3 is always true.
- C5: “C1 holds or C4 holds” — C1 is false but C4 is true, so C5 is true.

Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true given the event constraints:
  - Initially event2 happened.
  - After any event2, event1 must happen.
  - After any event1, event2 must happen.
  This forces an infinite alternation: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" In the forced alternating trace both events do happen (indeed infinitely often), so C1 holds at times when an event occurs.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" That is true at times when event2 occurs, false at times when event1 occurs.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" This would require event2 to occur at every time step. But since event1 occurs at every other step, C2 is not true at those steps. Therefore C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is false, C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" C3 is a global (unchanging) falsehood for the trace, so C4 (the statement ""C3 does not hold"") is true at all times; hence C5 is true.

Sample responses:
First, what C5 asks:
- C5 is ""C4 holds or event1 happens."" We must decide if that disjunction is true given the context.

Examine each condition using the context:
- Context facts: initially event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 does occur). After event2, no other events can happen.
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" Given the context, both event1 (initially) and event2 (must happen after event1) occur, so C1 is true.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C1 holds and C2 holds."" Since C1 and C2 are true, C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Because event1 already happened initially, the disjunctions in C1 and C2 remain true at all times (past occurrence of event1 guarantees the disjunct), so C3 is true at every point in the execution — therefore C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 holds or event1 happens."" We have shown C4 is true (and event1 also happens), so the disjunction is true.

Final answer:
True

First, what is being asked: determine whether C5 (""C4 holds or event1 happens"") is true given the context.

Examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 occurs.
- After event1, event2 must happen. So event2 also occurs (after event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen. So the sequence is event1 then event2, and nothing else.

Examine the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" Given the context both event1 and event2 happen, so C1 is true.
- C2: same as C1, so true.
- C3: C1 and C2 — true.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Since C1 and C2 are true in the run, C3 holds throughout, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 holds or event1 happens."" C4 is true, so the disjunction is true.

Therefore C5 is True.
---
The hypothesis asks whether C5 is true.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- From the context: event1 occurs initially, and after event1 event2 must occur; after event2 nothing else can happen. Thus both event1 and event2 do occur (event1 first, then event2).
- C1 = ""event2 happens or event1 happens."" Because both events happen, C1 is true.
- C2 is the same as C1, so C2 is also true.
- C3 = C1 and C2, so C3 is true.
- C4 = ""C3 always holds."" Since C1 and C2 are true throughout the run (they are true because the events do occur), C3 is true at every point, so C4 is true.
- C5 = C4 or event1 happens. Event1 does happen (and C4 is also true), so the disjunction C5 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true or false under the given context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- Therefore event1 never happens at any time (because event2 already happened and prevents any further events).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" — False (event1 never happens).
- C2: same as C1 — False.
- C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds.""  
  Interpreting ""event1 happens"" either as ""happens now"" or ""eventually happens"": in either case the implication is true (if event1 happens then it indeed happens eventually; if it doesn't happen the implication is vacuously true). So C3 is True.
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds.""  
  Since C1 is False, the implication C1 → C3 is vacuously True. So C4 is True.
- C5: ""C4 always holds.""  
  C4 is true at the initial state and at all subsequent states (event1 never occurs, so the antecedent of C4 is always false and the implication always holds). Thus C5 is True.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning (step by step):

- From the background: event2 has already happened initially, and after event2 no other events can happen. So event1 can never happen (there are no further events after event2).
- C1 and C2 both state ""event1 eventually happens."" Since event1 can never happen, C1 and C2 are false (everywhere).
- C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" This implication is true: its antecedent (event1 happens) is false in the actual model, so the implication holds vacuously; also if event1 did happen then C2 (event1 eventually happens) would indeed be true.
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" C1 is false, so this implication is also vacuously true (and thus holds).
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" Since C4 holds at the initial time and at every future time (the situation is stable: event1 never happens, so the antecedent of C4 remains false and C4 remains true), C5 is true.
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2 no other events can happen, so event1 will never occur at any later time.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" False (event1 never occurs).
- C2: same as C1, so False.
- C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" This is vacuously true: event1 does not happen, and even if it did, C2 is the same statement as event1 eventually happens.
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" C1 is false, so the implication is true; moreover if C1 were true, C3 would also hold as noted, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" C4 holds in the initial state and in all reachable states (no events can change anything), so C5 is True.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
You ask whether C5 is true or false. Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Context facts:
   - Initially event1 happened.
   - After event1, no other events can happen.
   Therefore from the start there are no further events; in particular event2 never happens at any time.

2. Evaluate C1–C5:
   - C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" True (event2 cannot occur because event1 already occurred and blocks further events).
   - C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" True (C1 is already true now, so it holds eventually).
   - C3: ""C2 always holds."" True (C2 is true now and remains true at all times).
   - C4: ""If event1 happens, then C3 holds."" True (event1 does happen initially, and C3 is true, so the implication holds).
   - C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" True (C4 holds now, so it holds eventually).

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 occurred.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has happened (which it has, initially), no future event (including event2) can ever occur.
- The rule ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 can never occur given the initial event1 and its terminal effect.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Given that event1 happened initially and prevents any further events, event2 indeed never happens. So C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" C1 already holds from the start, so it certainly holds at some future time (indeed at all times). So C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 holds now and nothing can change (no further events), C2 holds at all times, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""If event1 happens, then C3 holds."" Event1 does happen (initially) and C3 is true, so the implication is true. Thus C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" C4 is already true initially, so it holds eventually. Therefore C5 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. From the context: event1 happened initially, and after event1 no other events can happen. So once the initial state is reached, event2 can never occur.

2. Therefore C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is true (event2 never happens).

3. C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true because C1 already holds immediately (so it holds at some future moment — in fact now).

4. C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true because nothing can change (no further events), so once C2 holds it continues to hold forever.

5. C4 (""If event1 happens, then C3 holds"") is true: event1 did happen and C3 holds, so the implication is satisfied.

6. C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true because C4 already holds now, so it holds at some future moment as well.

Thus C5 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning, step by step:

- The hypothesis asks whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is true given the context.
- Context forces an infinite alternation: initially event1 occurs, and after event1 event2 must occur, and after event2 event1 must occur. So states are: t0: event1, t1: event2, t2: event1, ...
- C1 = ""event1 or event2 happens"". At t0 (initial) C1 is true (event1 happened).
- C2 = ""C1 does not hold"" is therefore false at t0 (and in fact false at every state, because the alternation guarantees one of the events at every state).
- C3 = ""C2 holds in the next state"" is false at t0 (since C2 is false at t1).
- C4 = ""C3 always holds"" is false (C3 does not hold at t0, so it cannot be always true).
- C5 = ""C4 does not hold"" is therefore true.
---
Step 1 — identify what's asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context and conditions
- Context (temporal behavior): initially event1 happens. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, event1 must happen. So the system alternates event1, event2, event1, ...
- C1: event1 or event2 holds (i.e., in a given state, at least one of them happens).
- C2: C1 does not hold (neither event1 nor event2 holds).
- C3: C2 holds in the next state.
- C4: C3 always holds (i.e., in every future state).
- C5: C4 does not hold.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions against the context
- In the initial state s0, event1 holds → C1 is true in s0. Therefore C2 is false in s0.
- In the next state s1, event2 holds (by the rules) → C1 is true in s1, so C2 is false in s1. Thus the statement ""C2 holds in the next state"" (C3, evaluated at s0) is false.
- Since C3 is false (it does not hold at s0), the claim ""C3 always holds"" (C4) is false.
- Therefore its negation, C4 does not hold (C5), is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Goal: decide whether C5 is True or False.

Context timeline: initial state S0: event1. After event1 must come event2, after event2 must come event1. So the states alternate: S0: event1, S1: event2, S2: event1, S3: event2, ... (forever).

Evaluate the conditions:

- C1: ""event1 happens or event2 happens."" In every state one of the two events occurs (by the alternating sequence), so C1 is true in every state.

- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 holds in every state, C2 is false in every state.

- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" C2 is false in every state, so C3 is false in every state.

- C4: ""C3 always holds."" C3 is false, so C4 is false.

- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is false, C5 is true.

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Context (interpreting “after” as “in the next state”): initially event1 holds, and each time event1 occurs the next state has event2, and each time event2 occurs the next state has event1. So events alternate and every state has either event1 or event2.
- C1 (event2 or event1) therefore holds in every state.
- C2 (C1 does not hold) is therefore false in every state.
- C3 (C2 holds in the next state) is false in every state (because C2 is never true).
- C4 (C3 eventually holds) is false.
- C5 (C4 does not hold) is true.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event1 happens, so C1 (""event2 or event1"") is true at the initial state. Hence C2 (the negation of C1) is false at the initial state.
- C3 says ""C2 holds in the next state"" — this can be true if the immediate next state has neither event1 nor event2. That is permitted by the given constraints because the obligations ""after event1, event2 must happen"" and ""after event2, event1 must happen"" require the corresponding other event eventually, not necessarily immediately.
- If the next state indeed has neither event, C3 holds at the initial state, so C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true (in fact it holds immediately).
- Therefore C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is false.

1. From the context: initially event2 happened, so ""event2 happens"" is true.
2. Because after event2 no other events can happen, event1 does not occur at any time.
3. C1 = (event2 happens) OR (event1 happens). Since event2 happens, C1 is true.
4. C2 = (event1 happens) AND C1. Event1 does not happen, so C2 is false.
5. C3 = (event2 happens) OR (event1 happens). Same as C1, so C3 is true.
6. C4 = C2 OR C3. With C2 false and C3 true, C4 is true.
7. C5 = ""C4 eventually holds"". C4 already holds now, so C5 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what’s asked:
- Determine whether C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen → event1 never happens (there are no events after the initial event2).
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant because event1 does not occur.

Step 3 — evaluate each condition:
- C1: event2 or event1. True (event2 happened).
- C2: event1 and C1. False (event1 did not happen).
- C3: event2 or event1. True (same as C1).
- C4: C2 or C3. True (C3 is true).

Step 4 — C5: ""C4 eventually holds""
- C4 already holds at the initial state, so it holds at some time ≥ now. Therefore C5 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked:
We must decide whether C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context:
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 is true at the initial point.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So once event2 has occurred, no event1 or any other event can occur later.
- After event1, event2 must happen (i.e., if event1 occurs, then event2 must occur afterwards).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" Since event2 already happened initially, C1 is true.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" This requires event1 to happen. But event1 cannot happen after event2 (no events after event2), and there is no time before the initial event2 for event1 to have happened. Thus event1 does not happen, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" Same as C1, so C3 is true (because event2 happened).
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" Since C3 is true, C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" C4 already holds (at the initial point), so C4 does indeed hold at some point in the timeline — therefore C5 is true.

Final answer:
True"

Sample responses:
You are asking whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true given the stated initial facts. Step-by-step:

1. Restate the domain facts:
   - Initially (state s0) event2 happened.
   - After event2, event1 must happen → so in the next state s1, event1 happens.
   - After event1, no other events can happen → after s1 there are no events (in s2 and beyond event1 and event2 do not occur).

2. Evaluate the conditions:
   - C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This is false because event1 happens in s1.
   - C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Since event2 happened in s0, C2 would require C1 to hold (i.e., event1 never happens). But C1 is false (event1 does happen in s1), so C2 is false.
   - C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" Event1 does happen (in s1) but C2 is false, so C3 is false.
   - C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" For s0, the next state is s1; C3 does not hold in s1 (we just saw C3 is false), so C4 is false at s0.
   - C5: ""C4 always holds."" Because C4 is already false at s0, C5 cannot be true.

Final answer: False
---
First, what the hypothesis asks: is C5 (""C4 always holds"") true or false given the context?

Now examine the context and each condition, step by step.

Context (interpreting ""after"" as ""in the next state""):
- Initially (state s0) event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → in the next state (s1) event1 happens.
- After event1, no other events can happen → once event1 has happened (from s1 onward) no events occur in later states (s2, s3, ...).

Hypothesis conditions:
- C1: Event1 does not happen.
- C2: If event2 happens, then C1 holds. (A material implication: if event2 then event1 does not happen.)
- C3: Event1 happens and C2 holds.
- C4: C3 holds in the next state.
- C5: C4 always holds (i.e., at every state, C3 holds in the next state).

Trace and evaluate:
- s0: event2 happened (given). By the context, s1 must have event1.
- s1: event1 happens. Evaluate C3 at s1: ""event1 happens"" is true; ""C2 holds"" is also true at s1 because C2 (""if event2 then C1"") is vacuously true here (event2 does not happen at s1). So C3 is true at s1.
- For C5 to be true, C3 must hold at s2 (because C4 must hold at s1, and C4 says C3 holds in the next state). But after event1 (s1) no other events can happen, so s2 has no events; in particular event1 does not happen at s2, so C3 is false at s2.
- Therefore C4 does not hold at s1, so C4 is not true at every state; hence C5 (""C4 always holds"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- The question asks whether C5 (""C4 always holds"", i.e. C3 holds in the next state at every state) is true given the context.

- Context facts:
  1. Initially, event2 happened.
  2. After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur at some point following the initial state).
  3. After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

- Evaluate the conditions:
  - C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This contradicts the context statement that after event2 (which did happen initially) event1 must happen. Since event2 did happen initially, event1 must happen, so C1 is false.
  - C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Because event2 did happen, C2 would imply C1. But C1 is false, so C2 is false in the actual scenario.
  - C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" This requires both that event1 happens (true per context) and C2 holds (false), so C3 is false.
  - C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" Since C3 is false, C4 is false.
  - C5: ""C4 always holds."" Since C4 is already false, C5 cannot be true.

Therefore C5 is False."

Identify the question
- The hypothesis asks whether C5 (""If C3 holds, then C4 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Examine the context and each condition
- Context: Initially event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, event1 must happen. Thus event2 does happen (it must follow the initial event1).
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This contradicts the context, so C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" C2 is false, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""Event2 does not happen."" Same as C1, so C4 is false.

Evaluate C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds.""
- C3 (the antecedent) is false. In standard (material) logic, an implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously true), regardless of the truth of the consequent.

True

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C5 is true or false.

1) From the context: initial state has event1. After any event1, event2 must happen next; after any event2, event1 must happen next. So the sequence alternates: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

2) Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Interpreting ""always"" as holding at every state, this is false (event2 does not hold in the states where event1 holds).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Because C2 is false (and thus not true at all states), C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" C3 is false now and remains false in the next state, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is false, C5 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- The question is whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is true or false.
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" This is false, because initially event1 happened (so event2 does not hold at that initial state). The context only guarantees that after an event1 occurs, event2 will occur later, not that event2 holds in every state.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Because C2 is false at the initial state, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" C3 is false, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is false, its negation is true.

Therefore C5 is True.

You ask whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is true or false. Step-by-step:

1. Context: initially event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, event1 must happen. Thus events alternate: t0 event1, t1 event2, t2 event1, t3 event2, ...

2. C1: ""Event2 always happens."" That would mean event2 holds at every state (including the initial one). But at the initial state event1 happened, so event2 does not hold there. Also, because after event2 event1 must occur, event2 cannot hold at every state. So C1 is false.

3. C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false (even though event1 does happen initially).

4. C3: ""C2 always holds."" C2 is already false at the initial state, so C3 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We are asked whether C5 (""C4 holds or event2 happens"") is True or False given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — use the context
- Initially, event2 happened. Also, after event2 no other events can happen. So event2 does happen (at the initial time) and no future events occur.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Given that event1 never occurs (no events can occur after event2, and initial state only has event2), the implication is vacuously true. So C1 holds.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 already holds, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" Both disjuncts are true (C2 is true and event2 happened), so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is true, C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 holds or event2 happens."" C4 is false, but event2 did happen, so the disjunction is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. So event2 is true now and no further events (including event1) can occur.
- Also ""after event1 no other events can happen"" means if event1 ever happened it would prevent later events, but in this scenario event1 does not happen (because event2 already happened initially and stops all events).

Step 2 — evaluate C1:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Event1 never happens, so this implication is vacuously true. Thus C1 holds.

Step 3 — evaluate C2:
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 holds now (and hence trivially at some time), C2 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C3 and C4:
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" C2 is true (and event2 is also true), so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is true, C4 is false.

Step 5 — evaluate C5:
- C5: ""C4 holds or event2 happens."" C4 is false but event2 is true (initially), so the disjunction is true.

Conclusion: C5 is True.

True
---
Plan: evaluate each Ci given the context, then conclude C5.

Context summary: event2 happens initially. After event1 no other events can happen, and after event2 no other events can happen. Since event2 has already happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, event1 never happens.

Step-by-step:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Because event1 does not happen in this scenario, the implication is vacuously true. So C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" C1 already holds (immediately), so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" C2 is true (and event2 also happens), so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This is the negation of C3, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 holds or event2 happens."" C4 is false, but event2 does happen, so the disjunction is true.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) What is asked: whether C5 (""If C1 holds, then C4 holds"") is true given the context.

2) Context (interpreting X as ""in the next state""):
- s0 (initial): event1 has happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → in s1, event2 holds.
- After event2, no other events can happen → there is no further state with events after s1 (so X at s1 is false).

3) Evaluate the Ci at s1 (the state where event2 happens):
- C1: ""event2 happens and event2 happens"" — true in s1.
- C2: same as C1 — true in s1.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" = X C2 at s1. There is no next state with event2, so C3 is false at s1.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" = X^2 C2 at s1. Also false.
- C5: ""If C1 holds, then C4 holds"" is therefore false at s1 (C1 true, C4 false).

Since there is a reachable state (s1) where C1 holds but C4 does not, C5 is false.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Possible timeline given the context: S0 (initial) where event1 happened, then S1 where event2 happens, and no further states after S1.
- C1 and C2 assert ""event2 happens"" in the current state. These are false at S0 and true at S1.
- C3 says ""C2 holds in the next state"" — so C3 at a state s requires C2 at s+1.
- C4 says ""C3 holds in the next state"" — so C4 at s requires C3 at s+1, which in turn requires C2 at s+2.
- C5 is the implication ""If C1 holds, then C4 holds"" at the same state.

Evaluate at S1:
- C1 is true at S1 (event2 happens at S1).
- C4 at S1 requires C2 to hold at S3 (two states ahead), but there is no S2 or S3 (S1 is terminal), so C4 is false at S1.
- Thus the implication ""If C1 then C4"" is true→false at S1, so it is false.

Therefore C5 is False.
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
C5 is the formula: ""If C1 holds, then C4 holds."" We must decide whether this implication is true given the context (initial event1, then event2 must happen, and after event2 no further events can happen).

Step 2 — set up the states
- s0: the initial state where event1 happened.
- s1: the next state after s0 where event2 happens (by ""after event1, event2 must happen"").
- There is no state after s1 (by ""after event2, no other events can happen"").

Step 3 — interpret the Ci’s
- C1: ""Event2 happens"" (holds exactly in s1).
- C2: same as C1 (holds in s1).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — so C3 is true in a state precisely when its successor state satisfies C2.
  - C3 is true in s0 because s0’s next state s1 satisfies C2.
  - C3 is false in s1 because s1 has no successor, so there is no next state in which C2 holds.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — so C4 is true in a state when its successor satisfies C3.
  - C4 is false in s0 because s1 does not satisfy C3.
  - C4 is false in s1 because s1 has no successor.
- C5: ""If C1 holds, then C4 holds."" This must be true in every state for C5 to be true globally.

Step 4 — find a counterexample
At s1, C1 is true (event2 happens there) but C4 is false (no successor where C3 could hold). So the implication C1 → C4 is false in s1.

C5 is False."

Step-by-step:

1. C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" is equivalent to ""Event2 happens."" This is true because event2 did happen initially.

2. C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Given the context rule ""after event2, event1 must happen,"" once event2 has happened (C1) event1 must occur. So C2 is true.

3. C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" Since C2 is true, this disjunction is true, so C3 is true.

4. C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 already holds now, so it certainly holds at some time (present or future); thus C4 is true. (Even if ""eventually"" were taken to require a strictly later time, the cyclical obligations guarantee C3 will hold at some later point as well.)

5. C5: ""C4 holds and event2 happens."" We have C4 true and event2 did happen initially, so the conjunction is true.

Therefore C5 is True.

Answer sought: whether C5 is True or False.

Step-by-step:
- The context says event2 happened initially, and after event2 event1 must happen (and after event1 event2 must happen). So event2 does indeed happen.
- C1 is ""event2 happens or event2 happens"" — equivalent to ""event2 happens"", so C1 is true.
- C2 is ""if C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Given C1 (event2) and the context rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"", C2 is true.
- C3 is ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" Both disjuncts are true, so C3 is true.
- C4 is ""C3 eventually holds."" Since C3 already holds, C4 is true.
- C5 is ""C4 holds and event2 happens."" Both are true (C4 true and event2 happened), so C5 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
You’re asking whether C5 (""C4 holds and event2 happens"") is true given the context and the intermediate conditions.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 happens.
- After any event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur sometime after that event2).
- After any event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur sometime after that event1).
Thus starting from the initial event2, event1 will occur, then event2 again, and so on (an infinite alternation). In particular, event2 does happen (at least initially), and event1 does happen (after that initial event2).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — equivalent to ""event2 happens"". True (holds initially).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Since C1 is true and the context requires event1 after event2, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" Both disjuncts are true, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 already holds, so it eventually holds; C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 holds and event2 happens."" C4 is true and event2 does happen (initially and repeatedly), so C5 is true.

Sample responses:
What is asked
- Decide whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is true or false given the context.

Given context (interpreted plainly)
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. (So once we start in the initial state, there is no way for event1 to occur later.)

Examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" — False, because after event2 no further events (including event1) can happen.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" — False, since C1 is false (and event1 cannot happen).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" — False, there is no future point where C2 becomes true.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" — False, because C3 is false (and nothing can change in the future).
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" — True, because C4 is false.

Conclusion
True
---
Answer: True

Reasoning (concise, non-hidden):

- Context: Initially event2 has happened. The rules say that after event2 no other events can happen (so the initial state is terminal — there is no successor state where any event can occur). Also after event1 no other events can happen (but that doesn't matter because event1 never occurs here).

- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" There is no next state (no events can occur after the initial event2), so C1 is false.

- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Since C1 is false and event1 does not happen, C2 is false.

- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 never holds (no future state can make it true), so C3 is false.

- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" C3 is false, so C4 is false.

- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is false, C5 is true.

Therefore C5 is True.
---
Step 1 — interpretation of the context
- The initial state already has event2 having happened.
- The rules “after event1, no other events can happen” and “after event2, no other events can happen” mean that once either event occurs, the system has no further events in any later state.
- So, starting from the initial state (where event2 has happened), no events will occur in any future state.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition
- C1: “Event1 happens in the next state.” Since no events can occur after event2, event1 does not happen in the next state. So C1 is false.
- C2: “Event1 happens and C1 holds.” This is the conjunction of event1 happening and C1 being true. C1 is false, so C2 is false.
- C3: “C2 eventually holds.” Since C2 is false now and no events can change anything in the future, C2 will never hold, so C3 is false.
- C4: “C3 holds in the next state.” C3 is false in every state, so C4 is false.
- C5: “C4 does not hold.” Since C4 is false, C5 is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s asked:
C5 is ""C4 holds in the next state"". We must decide whether C5 is true given the context and the chain C1..C4.

Step 2 — examine each condition:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a propositional tautology (p → p), so C1 is true in every state, regardless of whether event1 actually occurs there.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is true in every state, the temporal claim ""always C1"" is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" C2 is true in every state, so it is also true in the next state; hence C3 is true now.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" Same reasoning: C3 is true in every state, so C4 is true now.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" Since C4 is true in every state, C5 is true now.

Step 3 — trace/consistency with the event sequence:
The alternating event sequence (1,2,1,2,...) does not contradict any of the above because C1 is a tautology and the rest are temporal nesting of truths. All Ci hold at all states.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C5 is true in the initial state given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautological implication (p → p), so C1 is true in every state.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is true in every state, C2 is true (C1 is globally true).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Because C2 is globally true, it also holds in the next state, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" Same reasoning—C2 is global, so C3 holds at all times; thus C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" Again, by the same global truth of C2 (and hence of C3 and C4), C5 is true.

Conclusion
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
You are asked whether C5 is true or false given the context and the chain of conditions C1–C5.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a logical tautology (p → p). It is true in every state regardless of the event sequence.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is true in every state, the universal/always claim C2 is true in every state.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Because C2 holds in all states, it certainly holds in the next state.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" Same reasoning: C3 holds everywhere, so it holds in the next state.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" Again, given the previous points, this is true.

Step 3 — role of the event sequence
The given alternating-event constraints (event1 then event2 then event1 ...) do not conflict with any of the C1–C5 claims because C1 is a tautology and C2–C5 are just temporally shifted assertions about that tautology.

Step 1 — what is being asked
- C5 is the formula ""If C4 holds, then event2 happens."" We must determine whether this implication is true given the context.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions from the context
- Context: initially event2 happened; after event1 no other events can happen; after event2 no other events can happen. So the system reaches a terminal situation at the initial state (event2 has occurred) and there is no next state.
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Either event1 never happens (because event2 already happened and no further events can occur), in which case C1 is vacuously true, or if event1 could co-occur with event2 initially, then event2 also holds when event1 holds, so C1 is true. Thus C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is true (and there are no further states that could falsify it), C2 holds.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 already holds, so C3 holds.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" There is no next state (the initial state is terminal), and in standard temporal semantics ""next"" is false when there is no next state. So C4 is false.
- C5: ""If C4 holds, then event2 happens."" This is an implication with a false antecedent (C4). An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously true).

Step 1 — what is being asked
C5 is the statement: ""If C1 holds, then C4 holds."" We must decide whether C5 is true given the context.

Step 2 — restate the context and the C-conditions
- Context: initially event2 happened. After any event1, event2 must happen (event1 ⇒ eventually event2). After any event2, event1 must happen (event2 ⇒ eventually event1).
- C1: event1 happens. (redundant disjunction)
- C2: event1 happens. (same)
- C3: eventually C2 holds = eventually event1 happens.
- C4: event2 happens OR C3 holds = (event2 happens) OR (eventually event1).
- C5: If C1 holds (event1 happens) then C4 holds.

Step 3 — reason from the context
- If event1 happens at some point, the context requires that afterwards event2 must happen. So any occurrence of event1 guarantees a (later) event2.
- Therefore whenever C1 holds, ""event2 happens"" is true (at least at some point after that event1). That makes C4 true (since C4 is event2 happens OR eventually event1).

Also, if event1 never happens then the implication C5 is vacuously true. And note the initial event2 already makes ""event2 happens"" true in the trace regardless.

Step 4 — conclusion
Given the context, every case where C1 holds forces C4 to hold, so C5 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the pieces
- C1 = ""Event1 happens"" (same disjunct twice, so just event1 happens).
- C2 = ""Event1 happens"" (same).
- C3 = ""C2 eventually holds"" = ""event1 eventually happens"".
- C4 = ""Event2 happens or C3 holds"" = ""event2 happens or (event1 eventually happens)"".
- C5 = ""If C1 holds, then C4 holds"" = ""If event1 happens, then (event2 happens or event1 eventually happens)"".

Step 2 — use the context
- Initially event2 has happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
Thus event1 and event2 alternate and each occurs infinitely often (after any event1 there will be a later event2, and then a later event1, etc.).

Step 3 — evaluate the implication
- If event1 happens at some time (C1 true), then by the rules a later event2 will occur, and after that event1 occurs again. In particular, ""event1 eventually happens"" (C3) is true after any occurrence of event1. Therefore C4 (""event2 happens or C3"") is true whenever C1 is true.
- If C1 is false, the implication holds vacuously.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — understand the context
- At time 0, event1 happened.
- “After event1, no other events can happen” means once event1 has occurred, the run is stuck: no further events (including event2) can ever occur.
- “After event2, event1 must happen” is irrelevant here because event2 can never occur (event1 already happened initially and forbids any later events).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: “Event1 always happens.” Given the single possible behavior (event1 happens initially and no other events occur), every actual event occurrence in the run is event1, so C1 holds in this system.
- C2: “C1 does not hold.” This is the negation of C1, so C2 is false.
- C3: “C2 eventually holds.” Since C2 is false (it never becomes true), C3 is false.
- C4: same as C1, so C4 is true.

Step 3 — the implication C5
- C5 is “If C3 holds, then C4 holds.” The antecedent C3 is false, so the implication is vacuously true.

Final answer: True

Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

- The question asks whether C5 (if C3 holds then C4 holds) is true given the context.

- Context facts:
  1. Initially, event1 happened. So every execution starts with event1.
  2. After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred, the execution is terminal (no further events).
  3. After event2, event1 must happen. (This cannot trigger anything contrary to (1)–(2) because event2 cannot occur after the initial event1.)

- Interpret the Ci:
  - C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Given (1) and (2), event1 occurs in every possible execution (it happens initially and nothing can undo it). So C1 is true.
  - C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is true, C2 is false.
  - C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" That requires C2 to become true at some point; since C2 is false in all executions, C3 is false.
  - C4 is the same as C1, so C4 is true.

- C5 is the implication ""if C3 holds then C4 holds."" The antecedent C3 is false, so the implication is vacuously true.

Therefore C5 is True."

First, identify the question: we must decide whether C5 (""If C4 holds, then event1 happens"") is true or false, given the context and the other conditions C1–C4.

Interpretation (standard temporal reading):
- ""Always"" = globally (G)
- ""Next"" = X
- We have a single initial state S0 where event1 happened, and there are no successor states (because after event1 no other events can happen).

Evaluate the conditions at S0:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" (G event1). The only state is S0 and event1 holds there → C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (G C1). C1 holds at every state (only S0) → C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" (X C2). There is no next state, so X C2 is false → C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" (¬C3). Since C3 is false, C4 is true.
- C5: ""If C4 holds, then event1 happens"" (C4 → event1). At S0, C4 is true and event1 is true, so the implication is true.

Therefore C5 is True.

- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true (in the initial state).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" In the next state, there are also no events, so C1 is still false there; hence C2 is true in the next state, so C3 is true (at the initial state).
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Because no events ever occur after the initial event2, at every state C1 is false and thus C2 and C3 are true; therefore C3 holds at every state, so C4 is true (it holds now and at all future states).
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" If C4 already holds now (and at all states), then C4 certainly holds at some future (indeed the current) state, so C5 is true.

First, what the hypothesis asks: whether C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true given the context.

Now examine each condition using the context:
- Context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no events can happen. Also after event1 no events can happen. So once event2 has happened (which is the initial situation), no further events will ever occur.

Evaluate the conditions step by step:
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Given that after event2 no events can happen, event1 cannot happen in the next state. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true (C1 does not hold).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" In every future state (there are no events, but the next state(s) still exist as states), event1 still will not happen, so C1 is false in those states and C2 is true there. Thus C2 holds in the next state, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" We just saw C3 holds at the current state and at every future state (because event1 never happens anywhere after the initial event2). Therefore C3 holds globally, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" Since C4 already holds now (and hence at some future point), C5 is true.

Conclusion: C5 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — unpack the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" → i.e. ""Event1 does not happen in the next state.""
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" → i.e. ""In the next state, event1 does not happen in that state's next state.""
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" → C3 is true in every state.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" → at some point from then on, C3 holds at every state.

Step 3 — use the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. (So once we are in the initial state where event2 happened, event1 will never occur in any future state.)
- The other statement (""After event1, no other events can happen"") is irrelevant because event1 never occurs.

Step 4 — evaluate the Cs
- Because event1 never happens after the initial event2, C1 is false in the initial state (and in any future state).
- Therefore C2 (¬C1) is true in the initial state and in every future state.
- Since C2 is true in every state, C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is true in every state that has a next state (and under the natural reading it holds everywhere because C2 is eternal).
- Thus C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true starting immediately.
- If C4 already holds, then ""eventually C4"" (C5) is true (it holds now, so it certainly holds eventually).

Sample responses:
You ask whether C5 is true.

1) From the context:
- event2 happens initially.
- After event2, event1 must happen, so event1 will occur at some later time.
- After event1, no further events occur (irrelevant to truth of these logical conditions except to show event1 does occur).

2) Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""event2 happens or event1 happens."" True (event2 happens).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" True, because C1 is true and event1 does occur.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" True — C2 holds at the time event1 occurs.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event1 happens."" The antecedent C3 is true and the consequent event1 is true, so the implication C4 is true.
- C5: ""If C4 holds, then event1 happens."" C4 holds and event1 happens, so this implication is true.

Conclusion: C5 is True.
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
- We must decide whether C5 (the statement ""If C4 holds, then event1 happens"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur at some later point).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal but does not prevent it from occurring).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions in order
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" True, because event2 already happened.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" C1 holds, and event1 must happen (by the rule after event2), so C2 will be true (it holds once event1 occurs).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" True, because C2 will hold when event1 occurs.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event1 happens."" C3 does hold, and event1 does happen, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""If C4 holds, then event1 happens."" C4 holds and event1 happens, so C5 is true.

Final answer
True

First, what is being asked: determine whether C5 (""If C4 holds, then event1 happens"") is true given the context.

Context summary (timeline constraints)
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 does occur at some later time).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step-by-step checking
1. C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" True, because event2 happens initially.
2. C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" True, since C1 holds and event1 later does happen.
3. C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" True, because at the time event1 occurs, C2 holds — so C2 holds at some time.
4. C4: ""If C3 holds, then event1 happens."" C3 does hold, and event1 indeed happens, so C4 is true.
5. C5: ""If C4 holds, then event1 happens."" C4 holds (is true) and event1 happens, so the implication is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — from the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → event1 does happen.
- After event1 no other events can happen (doesn't prevent event1 itself).

So event1 happens (E1 is true).

Step 2 — interpret the conditions:
- C1: event1 happens (redundant conjunction) → C1 is true.
- C2: C1 does not hold → C2 is false (since C1 is true).
- C3: event1 happens (same as C1) → C3 is true.
- C4: If C2 holds then C3 holds. Since C2 is false, the implication C4 is true (an implication with a false antecedent is true). Equivalently, C4 is true because C4 reduces to E1 in this setup, and E1 is true.
- C5: If event1 happens, then C4 holds. Antecedent (event1) is true and consequent (C4) is true, so C5 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
You are asked whether C5 is true or false, given the context and the listed conditions.

Step 2 — translate the conditions
- Context:
  - Initially event2 happened.
  - After event2, event1 must happen. => event1 does happen.
  - After event1, no other events can happen. (irrelevant for truth of these propositions beyond showing event1 is terminal.)
- Propositions:
  - C1: event1 happens (redundantly written twice).
  - C2: C1 does not hold = event1 does not happen.
  - C3: event1 happens (same as C1).
  - C4: If C2 holds then C3 holds = (if event1 does not happen then event1 happens). Logically C4 is equivalent to event1 (¬E1 -> E1 simplifies to E1).
  - C5: If event1 happens then C4 holds = event1 -> C4.

Step 3 — evaluate using the context
- From the context, event2 happened and after event2 event1 must happen, so event1 does happen (E1 is true). 
- C4, which is equivalent to E1, is therefore true.
- C5 is the implication E1 -> C4. Since E1 is true and C4 is true, C5 is true. (Note also that logically C4 ≡ E1, so C5 ≡ E1 -> E1, a tautology.)

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C5 is true or false given the context and the defined propositions C1–C4.

Step 2 — understand the context and events
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → event1 does happen (some time after event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen → event1 is terminal, but that does not prevent event1 from occurring.

So from the context, event1 does indeed happen.

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is just a redundant restatement that event1 happens, so C1 is true (because event1 happens).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is true, C2 is false.
- C3: same as C1, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" Since C2 is false, the implication is true (an implication with a false antecedent is true). So C4 is true.
  (Note: logically C4 is equivalent to C1 here, but evaluating directly given C1 true also gives C4 true.)
- C5: ""If event1 happens, then C4 holds."" Event1 does happen (from the context) and C4 holds, so the implication is true.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C5 evaluates to True.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (stepwise):
- Initially event1 happened, and the context says “after event1, no other events can happen.” Therefore event2 cannot occur in any possible continuation.
- C1 (event2 → event1) is true vacuously (antecedent never holds). C2 (C1 and event1) is true now. C3 (“C2 always holds”) need not hold, so C4 (C3 does not hold) can be true — but this is irrelevant for C5.
- C5 is “if event2 happens, then C4 holds.” Because event2 cannot happen, the antecedent is always false, so the implication is vacuously true.

Thus C5 is True.
---
Goal: decide whether C5 (""If event2 happens, then C4 holds"") is True or False.

Step 1 — facts from the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 has occurred in the world.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Because event1 already happened initially, no other events (including event2) can ever happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen — this is irrelevant because event2 never occurs here.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" This is true in the actual world: event1 did happen, so the implication holds (either vacuously or because the consequent is true).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" True, since we established C1 and event1 happened.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" C2 is a factual statement about the world (C1 is true and event1 happened), and those remain true at all times in this scenario, so C3 holds.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This is false because we just concluded C3 does hold.
- C5: ""If event2 happens, then C4 holds."" Event2 cannot happen (blocked by the initial event1), so the antecedent of this conditional is impossible in the scenario. Therefore the conditional is vacuously true.

Final answer: True
---
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

- From the context: event1 happened initially, and after event1 no other events can happen. Therefore event2 does not occur at any time after the initial event. (In the natural reading “after event1 no other events can happen” and “event1 happened initially” imply event2 never happens.)

- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Because event2 never happens, the antecedent is false, so the implication C1 is vacuously true.

- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" We have just shown C1 is true, and event1 did happen initially, so C2 is true.

- C3: ""C2 always holds."" C2 is a factual/unchanging combination (C1 true and event1 having happened), so C3 holds.

- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This contradicts the previous line, so C4 is false.

- C5: ""If event2 happens, then C4 holds."" Since event2 never happens, the antecedent is false, so C5 is vacuously true.

Therefore C5 is True.

(Note: if one allowed event2 to occur simultaneously with the initial event1, the truth of C5 could change; under the standard sequential reading above, C5 is True.)"

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
We must decide whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true given the three background constraints:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e. in the next state).
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Step 2 — simplify the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" (global claim that event2 holds at every state)
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" (C2 = event1 ∨ C1)
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" So C3 = event1 ∧ (event1 ∨ C1) which simplifies to just event1 (because event1 ∧ (event1 ∨ X) ≡ event1).
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" Since C3 ≡ event1, C4 is: next-state(event1).
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" So C5 asserts that at every state, the next state has event1 (globally next(event1)).

Step 3 — trace a concrete execution satisfying the background constraints
Build the natural trace given the constraints:
- State s0 (initial): event2 holds (given).
- Because after event2 event1 must happen, state s1: event1 holds.
- Because after event1 no other events can happen, state s2: no events hold (or at least event1 does not hold in s2).

Step 4 — evaluate C5 on this trace
- At s0: C4 (next-state(event1)) is true because s1 has event1.
- At s1: C4 requires that s2 has event1, but s2 does not (no events after event1). So C4 is false at s1.
- Because C4 is not true at every state (it fails at s1), C5 (""C4 always holds"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — timeline from the context
- t0 (initial): event2 happens.
- After event2, event1 must happen → at t1 event1 happens.
- After event1, no further events can happen → at t2, t3, ... no events occur.

Step 2 — evaluate conditions at relevant times
- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" — false (event2 occurs at t0 but not at t1 or later).
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds""
  - At t0: event1 does not yet happen and C1 is false → C2 false at t0.
  - At t1: event1 happens → C2 true at t1.
  - At t2: event1 does not happen and C1 is false → C2 false at t2.
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds""
  - At t0: event1 false → C3 false at t0.
  - At t1: event1 true and C2 true → C3 true at t1.
  - At t2: event1 false → C3 false at t2.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" (Next(C3))
  - At t0: Next state is t1, C3 true at t1 → C4 true at t0.
  - At t1: Next state is t2, C3 false at t2 → C4 false at t1.
- C5: ""C4 always holds"" — requires C4 true at every time. But C4 is false at t1, so C5 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initial state s0: event2 happened.
- Rule A: ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — so from s0 there is a next state s1 where event1 occurs (event1 will eventually occur after event2).
- Rule B: ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — once event1 has occurred (e.g. in s1) there are either no further states or all future states have no events; in particular event1 does not occur again after s1.

Step 2 — evaluate the Ci formulas along the trace s0 → s1 (and then terminal)
- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" (globally). False: event2 holds at s0 but not at s1 (after event1 no events happen), so C1 is false.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"". True at s0 and s1 because event1 does occur (at s1), so the disjunction is satisfied.
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds"". True at s1 (event1 holds there and C2 holds), so C3 is true at s1.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" (i.e. X C3). At s0 this is true because the next state s1 satisfies C3. But at s1 it is false: there is no further state with event1 (by Rule B), so C3 does not hold in s1's next state (either there is no next state, making X C3 false, or the next state does not satisfy C3). Thus C4 is not true at s1.
- C5: ""C4 always holds"" (globally). This requires C4 to hold at every state. Since C4 fails at s1, C5 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C5 says: ""Eventually, C4 holds"" (i.e., at some future point (possibly now) C4 is true).
- We must decide whether C5 is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: same as C1 (identical statement).
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Since C1 and C2 are identical, C3 is a logical tautology at any state (C1 → C1).
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" (i.e., C3 holds in every state / globally).
- C5: ""Eventually C4 holds"" (there exists some state in the future where C4 is true).

Step 3 — use the context about events
- Initially, event1 happened in the initial state.
- After event1, no other events can happen. That means in every subsequent state no events occur (in particular, event1 does not occur in any next state).
- Therefore, at any state, C1 is false (event1 does not happen in the next state), and C2 is also false. So C1 and C2 are both false in every state.

Step 4 — evaluate the conditions
- At any state, C1 → C2 is true because false → false is true. Thus C3 holds in every state.
- Since C3 holds in every state, C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true (it holds globally).
- If C4 holds globally, then certainly C4 holds at some future point (indeed, it holds now), so ""eventually C4"" (C5) is true.

Conclusion
True

What is being asked
- C5 says ""C4 eventually holds"" (there exists some future state where C4 is true). We must decide whether C5 is true given the context.

Examine the conditions
- Context: initially event1 happened. After event1, no other events can happen. (So from the initial state onward there are no further events in any future state.)
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (This is false in the initial state because no events happen after the initial event1.)
- C2: same as C1, so also false in the initial state (and in every future state).
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" An implication with identical consequent and antecedent is true whenever C1 is false; since C1 is always false here, C3 is true in every state (vacuously).
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Because C3 is true at every state, C4 holds (globally).
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" Since C4 already holds at the initial state (indeed at every state), C5 is true.

Conclusion
- True
---
Step 1 — What is being asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true or false, given the context and the definitions C1–C4.

Step 2 — Understand each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (same as C1)
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" This is an implication between the same proposition (C1 -> C1), i.e. a tautology.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Since C3 is a tautology, it holds in every state.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" If C4 holds in every state, then it certainly holds at some future point (i.e. eventually).

Step 3 — Use the context to check consistency
- Context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. That may make C1 false in the initial state (event1 does not reoccur in the next state), but that does not affect the truth of C3 because C3 is (C1 -> C1), which is true even when C1 is false.
- Because C3 is true in every state, C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true. Consequently C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is also true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Translate the Cs:
  - C1 = (E1 ∨ E2).
  - C2 = X C1 (C1 holds in the next state).
  - C3 = G C2 (C2 always holds).
  - C4 = X C3 (C3 holds in the next state).
  - C5 = F C4 = F X G X (E1 ∨ E2).

- Understand the system behavior:
  - Initially E2 is true (some state s0 has E2).
  - After E2, E1 must happen (so at some later state E1 is true).
  - After E1, no further events ever happen (no E1 or E2 true in any state after the state where E1 occurred).

- Evaluate C5 = F X G X (E1 ∨ E2):
  - X G X (E1 ∨ E2) holding at a state j means that from j+1 onward, every future state must have (E1 ∨ E2) true.
  - But in our system, once E1 occurs there is an infinite tail of states with no events (neither E1 nor E2). Thus there is no point from which every future state has E1 or E2.
  - Therefore X G X (E1 ∨ E2) is false at every state, so F X G X (E1 ∨ E2) is false.

Hence C5 is False.

Step 1 — what is being asked
We must decide whether C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true given the scenario:
- initially event2 happens;
- after event2, event1 must happen;
- after event1, no other events can happen.

Step 2 — interpret the conditions (temporal reading)
Treating the Ci as temporal formulas:
- C1: event1 ∨ event2 (holds in a given state iff one of the events occurs there).
- C2: X C1 (C1 holds in the next state).
- C3: G C2 (C2 holds always / at every state from now on).
- C4: X C3 (C3 holds in the next state).
- C5: F C4 (C4 holds at some future state).

Step 3 — build the timeline from the context
A natural discrete-state trace consistent with the description:
- t0: event2 occurs (so C1 true at t0).
- t1: event1 occurs (so C1 true at t1).
- t2, t3, ...: no events occur (so C1 false at t2 and onward).

Step 4 — evaluate the Ci on the trace
- C1: true at t0 and t1, false from t2 onward.
- C2 = ""C1 in next state"": true at t0 (because C1 is true at t1), false at t1 and all later states (because C1 is false at t2 and onward).
- C3 = ""always C2"": false everywhere (C2 is not true at all states — it already fails at t1).
- C4 = ""next C3"": false everywhere (C3 is false at every state, so its next is false).
- C5 = ""eventually C4"": false (there is no state where C4 is true).

Step 5 — conclusion
C5 does not hold on the given scenario.

Final answer:
False

Answer: False

Step-by-step reasoning

1. Fix a timeline of states:
   - s0 (initial): event2 happened.
   - s1: event1 happens (required after event2).
   - s2, s3, ...: no events (after event1 no other events can happen).

2. Evaluate C1 = ""event1 or event2"":
   - C1 is true at s0 (event2) and at s1 (event1).
   - C1 is false at s2, s3, ... (no events).

3. C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" (next C1):
   - At s0: C2 is true because C1 holds at s1.
   - At s1: C2 is false because C1 does not hold at s2.
   - At s2 onward: C2 is false.

4. C3 = ""C2 always holds"":
   - C2 is not true at every state (it fails at s1 and later), so C3 is false everywhere.

5. C4 = ""C3 holds in the next state"" (next C3):
   - Since C3 is false at all states, C4 is false at all states.

6. C5 = ""C4 eventually holds"":
   - C4 never holds at any future state, so C5 is false.

Therefore C5 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
We must decide whether C5 (""Event2 happens and C4 holds"") is true given the context and the other C-conditions.

Step 2 — restate the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen. (i.e. event1 ⇒ event2)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (i.e. event2 ⇒ event1)

Step 3 — examine each Ci
- C1: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. This matches the context statement ""After event2, event1 must happen."" So C1 is true.
- C2: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. Same as C1, so C2 is true.
- C3: C2 always holds. Since C2 is a general rule given by the context, C3 is true.
- C4: If C1 holds, then C3 holds. We know C1 holds (true) and C3 holds (true), so the implication C1 → C3 is true; hence C4 is true.
- C5: ""Event2 happens and C4 holds."" Event2 happens initially (given), and we just established C4 is true. So C5 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C5 asserts: ""Event2 happens and C4 holds."" We must decide if that conjunction is true given the context and the other C-conditions.

Step 2 — map context to the C-conditions
- Context: initially event2 happened. Also: after event2, event1 must happen (i.e., event2 → event1). And after event1, event2 must happen (event1 → event2).
- C1: event2 → event1. This matches the context, so C1 holds.
- C2: event2 → event1. Same as C1, so C2 holds as well.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is entailed by the context, C3 holds.
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" C1 does hold, and C3 holds, so C4 is true (the implication is satisfied).
- The context also states event2 happened (initially), so ""event2 happens"" is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C5
- C5 is the conjunction: (event2 happens) AND (C4 holds). Both parts are true as shown above.

Final answer: True

Step 1 — what’s being asked
We must decide whether C5 (""Event2 happens and C4 holds"") is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — map conditions to the context
- Context: ""Initially, event2 happened."" So event2 indeed happens (at least initially).
- Context rule: ""After event2, event1 must happen."" That matches C1 and C2, which both state: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. So C1 = True and C2 = True.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is a general rule that follows from the context, C3 is True.
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" C1 is True and C3 is True, so the implication in C4 is True.

C5 asserts ""Event2 happens and C4 holds."" Event2 does happen (initially), and C4 holds (as shown). Therefore C5 is True.

Sample responses:
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Fix a timeline of states. Let t0 be the initial state where event1 happened (given). By the problem, after event1 (at t0) event2 must happen at t1; after event2 at t1, event1 must happen at t2, etc.

2. Evaluate C1 at t0: ""Event2 does not happen."" At t0 event2 indeed does not happen (event1 happened at t0), so C1 is true at t0.

3. Evaluate C2 at t0: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" This requires both C1 true and event2 happening at the same state. At t0 event2 does not happen, so C2 is false at t0.

4. C3 is ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false at t0, C3 is true at t0.

5. C4 is ""C3 holds in the next state"" (i.e. at t1). Check t1: because event1 occurred at t0, event2 must occur at t1. Thus at t1, event2 happens, and C1 (""event2 does not happen"") is false at t1; hence C2 is false at t1 and C3 (¬C2) is true at t1. Therefore C4 is true at t0.

6. C5 is ""Event1 happens and C4 holds."" At t0 event1 happens and, as shown, C4 holds at t0. Therefore C5 is true.
---
Step 1 — set up states
- State 0 (initial): event1 happened.
- By the rules: after event1 -> event2 must happen in the next state. So
  - State 1: event2 happens.
  - State 2: event1 happens again, etc. (they alternate).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions in State 0
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" In State 0, event2 does not happen (event1 happens), so C1 is true in State 0.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" In State 0, C1 is true but event2 does not happen in State 0, so C2 is false in State 0.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false in State 0, C3 is true in State 0.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" In State 1, evaluate C3: C2 is false there (because C1 is false in State 1 as event2 does happen), so C3 is true in State 1. Therefore C4 (C3 holds in the next state) is true in State 0.
- C5: ""Event1 happens and C4 holds."" In State 0, event1 happens and we just found C4 is true, so C5 is true in State 0.

Conclusion
C5 is True.
---
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. C1 = ""Event2 does not happen."" (a proposition about a given state.)
2. C2 = ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" This is a direct contradiction in the same state (it asserts both ""event2 does not happen"" and ""event2 happens""), so C2 is false in every state.
3. C3 = ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is always false, C3 is true in every state.
4. C4 = ""C3 holds in the next state."" Because C3 is true in every state, C4 is true in every state (the next state's C3 is true).
5. C5 = ""Event1 happens and C4 holds."" The context states that Event1 happened initially (and thereafter at alternating steps), and C4 holds in every state; therefore there are states (including the initial state) where both Event1 happens and C4 holds.

Thus C5 can be satisfied — it is True."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
We must decide whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 happened (so the initial state already has event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, no future event can occur).
- After event2, no other events can happen (redundant here, since event2 does not occur after event1).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" False — event1 has already happened initially and no further events can occur after event1, so it does not happen in the next state.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" False — C1 is false, and event2 cannot occur after event1, so C2 is false.

Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 would also be terminal).
- Because event1 already happened initially and it is terminal, no other events (including event2) can ever occur in any future state.

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" This is false: event1 happened initially, and no further events occur in the next state.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" This is false because event2 cannot occur, and C1 is false.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" False, since C2 can never occur.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" True (negation of false).
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" Since nothing can change after the initial state, C4 remains true in all states — so C4 indeed always holds.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Context: Initially event1 happened. Also, after event1 (and after event2) no further events can occur. So once event1 has occurred at the start, no events (neither event1 nor event2) can occur afterwards.

- C1 (""Event1 happens in the next state""): False — event1 already happened initially and no events can happen afterwards, so it cannot happen in the next state.

- C2 (""Event2 happens and C1 holds""): False — event2 cannot happen after the initial event1, and C1 is false.

- C3 (""C2 eventually holds""): False — C2 never holds, so it does not eventually hold.

- C4 (""C3 does not hold""): True — since C3 is false, C4 holds now.

- C5 (""C4 always holds""): True — because no events can change the situation after the initial event1, C3 remains false forever and hence C4 remains true in every state.

Therefore C5 is True."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Context gives: initially event1 happened, and ""after event1, event2 must happen."" So from the initial state the very next state must be one where event2 occurs. Also, ""after event2, no other events can happen,"" so the trace consists only of the initial state (event1) and the next state (event2).
- C1 (""Event2 happens in the next state"") is true at the initial state by the second rule.
- C2 (""Event2 happens or C1 holds"") is true at every state in the trace: at the initial state C1 holds; at the next state event2 happens.
- C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true because C2 holds at all states of the trace (there are no further states after event2).
- C4 is the same as C1, so it is true.
- Therefore C5 (C3 and C4) is true.
---
Step 1 — parse the context
- Initially, event1 has happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so immediately after the initial state, event2 occurs).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 2 — evaluate the components
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Given ""after event1, event2 must happen"" and event1 happened initially, C1 is true in the initial state.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" Since C1 is true in the initial state, C2 is true in the initial state.
- Consider the state after event2 (the terminal state): no events occur there. In that terminal state neither ""event2 happens now"" nor ""event2 happens in the next state"" is true, so C2 is false in the terminal state.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Because C2 fails in the terminal state, C3 is false.
- C4: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" This is the same as C1 and is true in the initial state.
- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" C3 is false while C4 is true, so C5 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

- Start: at the initial state event1 happened.
- By ""After event1, event2 must happen"", event2 occurs in the next state (call it state1). So C1 (""Event2 happens in the next state"") is true at the initial state. C4 is the same as C1, so C4 is true.
- After event2, no other events can happen, so in the subsequent state(s) (state2, state3, ...) event2 does not occur and will not occur.
- C2 is ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" Interpreting this as ""event2 happens now OR event2 happens in the next state"":
  - At state0: event2 does not happen now but C1 holds, so C2 is true.
  - At state1: event2 happens now, so C2 is true.
  - At state2: neither event2 happens now nor will it happen next, so C2 is false.
- C3 (""C2 always holds"") is therefore false (C2 fails at state2).
- C5 is C3 AND C4. C4 is true but C3 is false, so C5 is false."

Sample responses:
Answering what is asked: C5 is ""C4 eventually holds."" We must decide if that's true given the context.

Step-by-step reasoning

- Context: event2 has happened initially. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, no other events can happen. So event1 will occur (some time after the initial event2).

- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is just a redundant conjunction of the same fact, so C1 is equivalent to ""event1 happens."" Given the context, event1 will indeed happen, so C1 will be true at the time event1 occurs.

- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since event1 is guaranteed to occur after event2, C1 does eventually hold. So C2 is true.

- C3: same as C1, so C3 is true (event1 happens).

- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" The antecedent C2 is true and the consequent C3 is true, so the implication C4 is true (indeed it already holds).

- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" Because C4 already holds, it certainly holds at some time (immediately), so ""eventually C4"" is true.

Conclusion: True
---
First, what is being asked:
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true or false given the context and the other conditions.

Examine the conditions and the scenario:
- Context: event2 happened initially. After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur at some later time). After event1, no other events occur.
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — this is just a redundant way of saying ""event1 happens."" So C1 becomes true at the time event1 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — since event1 is guaranteed to happen after event2, C2 is true (from the initial moment there will eventually be a time when C1 holds).
- C3: same as C1, so C3 becomes true at the time event1 occurs.
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds"" — evaluate this over time:
  - Initially: C2 is true (event1 is guaranteed in the future), but C3 is not yet true (event1 has not yet occurred), so the implication C2 -> C3 is false at the initial moment.
  - At the moment event1 occurs: C3 becomes true; C2 is still true (it remains true because C1 holds at that time), so the implication C2 -> C3 is true at that time. Thus C4 becomes true at (or after) event1.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" — because C4 becomes true at the time event1 occurs, there is indeed a future moment when C4 holds.

Therefore C5 is True.
---
Identify the question
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true given the event constraints.

Examine the context and each condition
- Context: event2 happened initially; after event2, event1 must happen; after event1, no other events can happen. So the actual event sequence is: event2, then event1, and nothing afterward.
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is equivalent to ""Event1 happens."" Given the context, event1 does happen, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 is true (event1 occurs), C2 is true.
- C3: same as C1, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" With C2 true and C3 true, the implication C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" Because C4 is true (indeed it holds once event1 has occurred, and it already holds at that point), C5 is true.

Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Interpretations:
- ""event2 happens"" is an atomic fact true at the initial moment (given).
- C1 is the formula (event2 → event2). That is a logical tautology (p → p), so C1 is true at every moment.
- C2 asserts ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 already holds immediately (it holds at every state), C2 is true.
- C3 asserts ""C2 does not hold."" But we just established C2 is true, so C3 is false.
- C4 is the same as C1, so C4 is also true.
- C5 is the implication (C3 → C4).

2. Evaluate C5:
- An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously true).
- Here the antecedent C3 is false; also the consequent C4 is true. Either way, the implication C3 → C4 is true.

Therefore C5 is True.
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""If C3 holds, then C4 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition in the context
- Context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. So event2 occurs and no further events occur.
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (a → a), so C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 already holds (at all times), C2 holds (eventually is satisfied immediately).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" But C2 does hold, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" Same as C1, so C4 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C5
- C5 is the implication ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds.""
- The antecedent C3 is false, and the consequent C4 is true; an implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true (and here the consequent is also true anyway).

Final answer
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""If C3 holds, then C4 holds"") is true or false given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — the event timeline from the context
- Initially event2 happens.
- After event2 no other events can happen.
- So the only event that ever happens is event2 (it happens initially and the run ends).

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is true (antecedent and consequent both hold in the actual run; it is also a tautological implication).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" C1 already holds immediately, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This is the negation of C2, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" Same as C1, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" The antecedent C3 is false, so the implication C5 is vacuously true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Context constraints:
   - Initially event1 happened.
   - After event1, no other events can happen.
   => Therefore no event2 can ever occur in any possible run (because event1 already happened and it prevents any later events).

2. Evaluate conditions:
   - C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Given (1), this is false.
   - C3: same as C1, so also false.
   - C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true.
   - C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" That is true because C2 is true (C3 is false but irrelevant).
   - C5: ""C4 always holds."" C4 is a true statement given the model, so C4 holds; thus C5 is true.

Therefore C5 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true or false given the context and the listed conditions.

Step 2 — understand the context rules
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen → once event1 has occurred, no future events (including event2) can occur.
- After event2, event1 must happen (but this is irrelevant if event2 never occurs).

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Given that event1 happened initially and no other events can happen afterward, event2 cannot occur at any time. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- C3: ""Event2 always happens."" Same as C1, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" C2 is true, so C4 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C5
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" C4 is true (from above) and the truth of C4 does not change over time given the context, so C4 does indeed hold. Therefore C5 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
You’re asking whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true or false given the described event constraints.

Step 2 — understand the event constraints
- Initially, event1 has already happened.
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur (event1 must follow event2).
- After event1 occurs, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — consequences for event2
Because event1 has already happened initially and no events can happen after event1, event2 cannot happen at any time. If event2 were to happen it would have to occur after the initial time (but that’s disallowed), and in any case event2’s occurrence would require event1 afterward, which would block further events — inconsistent with having event2 after the initial event1. So event2 never happens.

Step 4 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" — False (event2 never happens).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" — True (since C1 is false).
- C3: ""Event2 always happens."" — Same as C1, False.
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" — True (C2 is true).
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" — C4 is true in the system and there is no change that could make it false, so C4 holds (and thus always holds).

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C2 holds or C3 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- Context: Initially event2 happened. After event2, no other events can happen. After event1, event2 must happen.
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This is exactly the same as the given ""After event1, event2 must happen."" So C1 is true.
  - Also, because event2 already happened initially and no events can occur afterwards, event1 never actually occurs; thus the implication event1 → event2 is also vacuously true.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 is true (from the context) at the initial moment, the eventuality ""C1 holds"" is satisfied (it already holds).
- C3: same as C2, so it also holds.
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" Since C2 (and C3) holds, the disjunction is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C2 holds or C3 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand each condition in the context
- Context facts:
  1. Initially, event2 happened.
  2. After event2, no other events can happen.
  3. After event1, event2 must happen.
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This matches context fact (3), so C1 is true (it's a given rule).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 is already true (it is a given/global rule), C1 holds now and therefore ""eventually C1"" is true.
- C3: same as C2 (duplicate), so also true.
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" A disjunction is true if at least one disjunct is true; here both are true.

Step 3 — additional reasoning about event sequences (to address possible confusion)
- Because event2 occurred initially and no events can happen afterward, event1 cannot occur later. That does not falsify C1: the implication ""if event1 then event2"" is satisfied (either by the rule or vacuously, since event1 cannot occur after event2). So C1 remains true at all times; hence C2 and C3 hold.

Final answer
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C2 holds or C3 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Context gives: ""After event1, event2 must happen."" That is exactly the content of C1 (""If event1 happens, then event2 happens""). So C1 is entailed by the context.
- Also context says event2 happened initially and then no further events occur; that means event1 never actually occurs in this run, but that only makes the implication C1 vacuously true as well.

Step 3 — about C2, C3, C4
- C2 and C3 both state ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 already holds (from the given rule), it certainly holds at some point (in fact from the start), so C2 and C3 are true.
- C4 is the disjunction ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" With C2 and C3 true, the disjunction is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context: initially event1 happened. The rules ""After event1, event2 must happen"" and ""After event2, event1 must happen"" force an alternating sequence event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → … so both events occur (and continue to occur) after the start.

2. C1 and C2 both state ""Event2 always happens"" (they are the same). Given the alternating sequence, event2 does occur repeatedly after the start, so C1 and C2 hold.

3. C3 says ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" Since C2 holds, event1 does happen (it in fact occurs repeatedly), so C3 holds.

4. C4 says ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" C1 holds, and we just showed C3 holds, so C4 holds.

5. C5 states ""C4 eventually holds."" C4 already holds (immediately), so C5 is true.

Therefore C5 is True.
---
True

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. What’s being asked: whether C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true given the context and the other conditions.

2. Interpret the context:
   - Initially event1 happened.
   - After event1, event2 must happen.
   - After event2, event1 must happen.
   These rules force an alternating sequence starting with event1: event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → …, so event2 does occur (indeed repeatedly).

3. Evaluate the conditions:
   - C1: Event2 always happens. Given the alternation forced by the context (event2 occurs after event1 and event1 occurs repeatedly), C1 is true.
   - C2: Event2 always happens. Same as C1, so C2 is true.
   - C3: If C2 holds, then event1 happens. Since C2 is true and the context requires event1 after event2, C3 is true.
   - C4: If C1 holds, then C3 holds. C1 is true and we have C3 true, so the implication C4 is true.
   - C5: C4 eventually holds. C4 already holds (from the above), so C4 indeed holds at some time (in fact immediately), so C5 is true.

Therefore C5 is True.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked
You are asked whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event2 has already happened (so at the initial state event2 holds).
- After event2, no other events can happen — i.e. the state with event2 is terminal (there is no next state).
- Also: ""After event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event1 does not occur (we already start in event2 and cannot have further events).

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True — event2 has already happened in the initial state.
- C2: same as C1, also True.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" False — there is no next state (event2 is terminal), so a ""next"" formula does not hold.
- C4: ""C1 holds and C3 holds."" False, because C3 is false.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" False, because C4 does not hold in the current (initial) state, so it cannot hold always.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Initially event2 has already happened, so ""event2 eventually happens"" (C1 and C2) is true in the initial state (event2 holds at the current state, so eventually event2 is satisfied).
- After event2 no other events can happen, so in the next state there is no occurrence of event2 (it cannot happen again).
- Therefore C2 does not hold in the next state, so C3 is false.
- C4 (C1 and C3) is false (since C3 is false).
- C5 asserts that C4 always holds, which is false because C4 is already false in the initial state (or at least not true in every state).

Thus C5 is False.
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Initially event2 happened, so at the initial state C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is true (event2 holds now, and ""eventually"" includes the current state).
- The context also says ""after event2, no other events can happen."" So once that initial event2 has occurred, no future state will see event2 again (or any other event).
- C3 says C2 (""event2 eventually happens"") holds in the next state. But in the next state there will be no event2 (and none in any later state), so ""event2 eventually happens"" is false in that next state. Hence C3 is false at the initial state.
- Therefore C4 = C1 ∧ C3 is false at the initial state, and so C4 does not hold always.
- C5 asserts C4 always holds; since we have a state where C4 is false, C5 is false."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Identify the question
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true given the initial events and the rules about what must happen after each event.

Understand the system
- Initially event2 occurs (call that time t0).
- Rule: after event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur at some time after t0).
- Rule: after event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur again after that).
- Therefore events alternate forever: event2 (t0), event1 (t1), event2 (t2), event1 (t3), ...

Examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True, because after the initial event2 at t0, event1 must occur (e.g., at t1).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" C1 is already true (we know event1 will happen), so there exists a time at which C1 holds — therefore C2 is true. (Even if ""eventually"" required a strictly later time, the alternating recurrence ensures C1 will hold at many future times.)
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" By the same reasoning, C2 holds now (or will hold repeatedly), so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 holds and event2 happens."" At t0, event2 happened and C3 holds, so C4 holds (and will hold at various times because event2 recurs).
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" Since C4 already holds (e.g., at t0), C5 is true. Even under a stricter interpretation, C4 will occur again in the alternating sequence, so C5 is still satisfied.

Final answer
True
---
Answer: True

Step-by-step reasoning

Context summarized: at time 0 event2 has occurred. The rules are:
- After any event2, an event1 must occur (i.e. event1 will eventually occur after event2).
- After any event1, an event2 must occur (i.e. event2 will eventually occur after event1).

This forces an alternating sequence: event2, then event1, then event2, then event1, … (infinitely many occurrences).

Evaluate the Ci:

- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True — by the rule, after the initial event2 an event1 will occur.

- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" C1 is true already at the initial time (and remains true at all times because event1 recurs infinitely), so there is certainly some future time at which C1 holds. Therefore C2 is true.

- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Same reasoning: C2 is true (indeed at all times), so C3 is true.

- C4: ""C3 holds and event2 happens."" At the initial time C3 holds, and event2 has happened initially, so C4 holds (and will continue to hold repeatedly because event2 recurs).

- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" Since C4 already holds (e.g. at the initial time), C5 is true.

Therefore C5 is True.
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — reinterpret the conditions
- Context: initially event2 has happened. After any event2, event1 must happen (i.e. event2 → eventually event1). After any event1, event2 must happen (event1 → eventually event2). So starting from the initial event2, the system guarantees event1 will occur, then event2 again, and so on.
- Translate the Ci:
  - C1 = ""event1 eventually happens"" = F(event1).
  - C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" = F(C1) = F(F(event1)) which is equivalent to F(event1).
  - C3 = ""C2 eventually holds"" = F(C2) = F(F(F(event1))) ≡ F(event1).
  - C4 = ""C3 holds and event2 happens"" = C3 ∧ event2. Since C3 ≡ F(event1), this is F(event1) ∧ event2.
  - C5 = ""C4 eventually holds"" = F(C4).

Step 3 — evaluate them given the context
- From the initial event2 and the rule event2 → eventually event1, C1 is true at the initial moment.
- Since C1 is true now, F(C1) (i.e. C2) is true (eventually C1 holds is trivially true if it holds now). By the idempotence of F, all nested F's reduce to F(event1), so C2 and C3 are true at the initial moment as well.
- C3 is true and event2 happened initially, so C4 is true at the initial moment.
- If C4 already holds now, then F(C4) (C5) is true.

Conclusion
- All steps show C5 is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 has happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, event2 cannot occur later).
- After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant here because event2 never occurs given the first two facts).

Step 2 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Given event1 already happened initially and no events can happen after it, event2 cannot happen at any time. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Event1 does happen, but C1 is false, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false, C3 is true (it holds already, at the initial state).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 already holds now, so ""eventually"" is satisfied; C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" Since C3 is true now and will remain true (no events can change facts that could make C2 true), C4 continues to hold; therefore C5 is true in the next state.

Final answer:
True

Step-by-step reasoning

1. Context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. Also if event2 ever happens then event1 must happen after it.
2. From ""initially event1 happened"" and ""after event1 no other events can happen"", event2 cannot occur at any time on the trace.
3. C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is therefore false.
4. C2 (""Event1 happens and C1 holds"") is false because C1 is false (even though event1 did happen).
5. C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true (since C2 is false).
6. C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true — in fact C3 holds right now, so it holds eventually.
7. C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"") requires a successor state. But after event1 no other events can happen, so there is no next state (no successor). Therefore the ""next"" condition fails and C5 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen → once event1 occurs, event2 can never occur anywhere later.
- After event2, event1 must happen — this is irrelevant because event2 can never occur (event1 already happened initially and prevents any later events).

Step 2 — evaluate the claims
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" False (event2 cannot happen).
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" False (event1 does happen, but C1 is false).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" True (since C2 is false).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" True — C3 already holds now, so it certainly holds eventually.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" In the next state C3 still holds (C2 never becomes true), so C4 (""eventually C3"") still holds there. Therefore C5 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C5 (""C1 holds or C4 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context and each condition
- Context: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 did occur.
- Context: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So once event1 occurs, no further events (including event2) can occur afterward.
- C1, C2, C3: each is the statement ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Since event1 actually happens, each of these requires event2 to happen.
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" This is a logical implication between the truth-values of C2 and C3.
- C5: ""C1 holds or C4 holds.""

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- Because event1 happened and no events can happen after it, event2 does not happen. Therefore the implication ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens"" is false (event1 true but event2 false). So C1, C2, and C3 are all false.
- C4 is ""if C2 then C3"". With C2 false and C3 false, the implication (false → false) is true (material implication is true when the antecedent is false).
- Therefore C1 is false, C4 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C5
- C5 = C1 or C4 = false or true = true.

Final answer:
True
---
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

- From the context: event1 happened initially. Also “after event1, no other events can happen,” so event2 cannot happen after event1. Since event1 did happen, event2 does not occur anywhere afterward (so event2 did not happen).

- Evaluate C1, C2, C3: each is the claim “if event1 happens, then event2 happens.” Because event1 does happen but event2 does not, those conditionals are false (true antecedent, false consequent).

- Evaluate C4: “If C2 holds, then C3 holds.” C2 and C3 are the same formula, and in fact C2 is false. An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously). So C4 is true.

- Evaluate C5: “C1 holds or C4 holds.” Since C1 is false but C4 is true, the disjunction is true.

Therefore C5 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C5 (C1 or C4) is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context and each condition
- Context: Initially event1 happened. After event1, no other events can happen. After event2, no other events can happen.
  => Event1 does happen, and no event (in particular event2) can occur after that. So event2 does not occur.
- C1: If event1 happens, then event2 happens. Because event1 does happen but event2 does not, C1 is false.
- C2 and C3 are the same as C1, so C2 = false and C3 = false.
- C4: If C2 holds, then C3 holds. Since C2 is false, the implication (false → anything) is true under material implication, so C4 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C5
- C5 = C1 or C4. With C1 false and C4 true, the disjunction is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — What is being asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true or false given the scenario and the other conditions.

Step 2 — Understand the scenario and timeline
- Initial state s0: event2 has happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → at s1 event1 happens.
- After event1, no other events can happen → s2, s3, ... have no events (nothing else happens).
- ""Eventually"" is taken in the usual temporal sense (it may hold now or at some later state). ""Next"" refers to the immediate successor state.

Step 3 — Evaluate the conditions state-by-state
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
  - At s0 this is true (event2 already happened at s0).
  - At s1 and later this is false (event2 does not occur at or after s1).

- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., at the successor state)
  - At s0 this asks whether C1 holds at s1 — it does not. So C2 is false at s0.
  - At s1 this asks about s2 — also false. So C2 is false in every state.

- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens.""
  - Because C2 is false in every state, the implication is vacuously true in every state. So C3 holds at all states.

- C4: ""C3 always holds.""
  - Since C3 is true in every state, C4 is true (it holds now and at every future state).

- C5: ""C4 eventually holds.""
  - C4 already holds at s0 (and everywhere), so C4 holds now; therefore C4 eventually holds. So C5 is true.

Final answer
True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1: true in the initial state because event2 already happened.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" is false — in the next state event2 does not (again) eventually happen, so C1 is not true there.
- C3: ""If C2 then event2"" is true in every state because its antecedent C2 is never true (an implication with a false antecedent is true).
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" is therefore true (C3 holds at every state).
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" is true because C4 already holds from the start.

Hence C5 is True.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
We must decide whether C5 is true or false in the initial state, given the context.

Step 2 — simplify each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" ≡ Event1 happens.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"" ≡ Event1 happens (since C1 ≡ Event1).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" ≡ not(Event1).
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" ≡ in the next state, Event1 does not hold.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" ≡ it is not the case that (in the next state Event1 does not hold) ≡ in the next state, Event1 holds.

Step 3 — use the context
- Initially Event2 happened.
- After Event2, Event1 must happen — so in the next state (from the initial state) Event1 does hold.

Step 4 — evaluate C5
- C5 is ""in the next state, Event1 holds"".
- From the context, that is true.

Answer: True
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
C5 is ""C4 does not hold."" We must decide whether C5 is true in the initial state given the context.

Step 2 — simplify the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" ≡ event1.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"" ≡ event1 (since C1 ≡ event1).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" ≡ not event1.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" ≡ next(not event1).
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" ≡ not next(not event1) ≡ next(event1).

So C5 asserts that event1 holds in the next state.

Step 3 — use the context to trace states
- Initially (state s0): event2 happened, so event1 is false at s0.
- The context says after event2, event1 must happen, so in the next state s1 event1 is true.
- Therefore next(event1) is true at s0.

Step 4 — conclusion
C5 (next(event1)) is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — simplify the conditions:
- C1 = ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" → C1 ≡ Event1.
- C2 = ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"" → C2 ≡ Event1 (since C1 ≡ Event1).
- C3 = ""C2 does not hold"" → C3 ≡ ¬Event1.
- C4 = ""C3 holds in the next state"" → C4 ≡ (in next state ¬Event1).
- C5 = ""C4 does not hold"" → C5 ≡ ¬(in next state ¬Event1) ≡ (in next state Event1).

Step 2 — use the context (initial state and required alternation):
- Initially (state0): Event2 is true, so Event1 is false.
- The rules force alternation: after Event2 must come Event1, then after Event1 must come Event2, etc. So state1 has Event1 true.

Step 3 — evaluate at the initial state (state0):
- C1 = Event1 → false.
- C2 = Event1 → false.
- C3 = ¬Event1 → true.
- C4 = ""C3 holds in the next state"" → in state1, Event1 is true, so C3 is false there → C4 is false.
- C5 = ¬C4 → true.

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Initially event2 happened. The rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"" means there are no further event occurrences after that initial state.
- Therefore event1 never happens (C1 is true).
- C2 says ""if C1 holds then event2 happens."" Even though C1 is true, any claim that event2 ""happens"" must refer to some (possibly later) event occurrence. But no events can occur after the initial event2, so you cannot make event2 happen again in a subsequent state.
- C3 requires C2 to hold in the next state. There is no next state in which an event2 can occur (and if the next-state operator is taken strictly, there is no next state with events), so C3 is false.
- C4 (C3 holds and event2 happens) therefore cannot hold in any future state.
- Hence C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is false.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step with the natural interpretation that ""happens"" = occurs at that instant):

1. Context:
   - At time 0 (initially) event2 occurs.
   - After event2, no other events can occur (so once event2 has occurred the future has no events).
   - After event1, event2 must happen — but that is irrelevant here because event1 never gets a chance once event2 has already occurred.

2. C1 (""Event1 does not happen""): true — event1 cannot occur after the initial event2, and it did not occur before (event2 was initial), so event1 never happens.

3. C2 (""If C1 holds, then event2 happens""): at time 0 this implication is satisfied (C1 true and event2 did happen at time 0). But C2 is a statement about occurrence at a particular state.

4. C3 (""C2 holds in the next state""): consider the next state after the initial one. In that next state, event2 does not occur (it occurred at time 0 and no events can occur after event2). So the implication ""if C1 then event2 happens"" fails in that next state (C1 still holds, but event2 does not happen there). Therefore C2 does not hold in the next state, so C3 is false.

5. Since C3 is false, C4 (""C3 holds and event2 happens"") cannot hold, and hence C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is false.

Therefore C5 is False under the standard instantaneous-event reading.
---
False

Reasoning, step by step:

- Initially event2 happens, and the rule ""after event2 no other events can happen"" means no events occur in any later state. So event1 never happens. Thus C1 is true.
- C2 (""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"") is true in the initial state because event2 already happened.
- But in the next state no events can occur (because event2 occurred initially), so event2 does not happen in that next state. Since C1 still holds there, the implication in C2 fails in the next state. Hence C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is false.
- If C3 is false then C4 and therefore C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") are also false.

Therefore C5 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
First, what is being asked:
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"") is true given the context and the chain of Ci conditions.

Set up the timeline (states):
- s0 (initial): event2 happened.
- By the rules, after event2 happens, event1 must happen → s1: event1 happens.
- After event1, event2 must happen → s2: event2 happens.
- This repeats: s0: event2, s1: event1, s2: event2, s3: event1, ...

Evaluate the conditions at the initial point (s0) and in the next state (s1) as needed:

1. C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
   - At s0, event2 did happen, so C1 is false.

2. C2: ""C1 does not hold."" 
   - Since C1 is false, C2 is true (and in fact C2 stays true at all states, because event2 occurs infinitely often, so ""event2 does not happen"" never holds globally).

3. C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens.""
   - C2 holds, so C3 requires that event1 happens. In our timeline event1 does happen (at s1, s3, ...), so C3 is true (it already holds at s0 because the implication is satisfied by the system behavior).

4. C4: ""C3 eventually holds.""
   - C3 already holds at s0, so C4 is true at s0 (and also true at s1, etc.).

5. C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" — evaluate whether C4 is true at s1.
   - At s1, C2 is still true, so C3 still holds (event1 happens at s1), hence C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true at s1 as well.

Therefore C5 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Context facts:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur following the initial event2).
- After event1, event2 must happen (they alternate).

2. Evaluate conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This contradicts the context (event2 did happen initially), so C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true (and stays true because the initial occurrence of event2 is a fact here).
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" C2 holds, and by the context event1 indeed will happen after the initial event2, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 already holds, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" Because C4 is true now (C3 holds now and will continue to be satisfiable in the future), C4 will still hold when we move to the next state. Therefore C5 is true.

Hence C5 is True.

Sample responses:
The hypothesis asks whether C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true.

Step-by-step:
- C1 is ""event2 and event2"", which is equivalent to ""event2 happens"".
- C2 is identical to C1, so also equivalent to ""event2 happens"".
- C3 is ""C2 and event2"" → still equivalent to ""event2 happens"".
- C4 is ""C1 or C3"" → a disjunction of two statements each equivalent to ""event2 happens"", so C4 ≡ ""event2 happens"".
- C5 is ""C4 eventually holds"" → equivalent to ""event2 eventually happens"".

From the context, event2 happens initially (and by the given requirements event1 and event2 will alternate thereafter), so event2 does occur (in fact immediately and repeatedly). Therefore ""event2 eventually happens"" is satisfied.

Final answer: True
---
First, what is being asked: C5 says ""C4 eventually holds."" We must decide whether, given the context, C4 will hold at some time (now or later).

Examine the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
Thus events alternate: event2 (initially), then event1, then event2, then event1, … — so event2 occurs now and will occur repeatedly (infinitely often).

Examine the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is just a conjunction of the same factual claim; since event2 happens (initially and repeatedly), C1 is true.
- C2: same as C1, so true.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" Since C2 is true and event2 happens, C3 is true.
- C4: ""C1 holds or C3 holds."" Both C1 and C3 are true, so C4 holds.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" Since C4 already holds now (and will continue to hold whenever event2 occurs), C4 certainly holds at some time — so ""eventually C4"" is true.

Therefore C5 is True.

True
---
Goal: determine whether C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true given the context.

Context summary
- Initially event2 occurred (call that time t0).
- After any event2, event1 must occur next.
- After any event1, event2 must occur next.
Therefore the timeline is an alternating infinite sequence starting with event2: t0: event2, t1: event1, t2: event2, t3: event1, t4: event2, ...

Interpretation of the C-conditions (natural reading: conjunctions mean multiple occurrences across time)
- C1: event2 happens and event2 happens — requires at least two occurrences of event2.
- C2: same as C1 (again at least two event2 occurrences).
- C3: C2 holds and event2 happens — requires at least three event2 occurrences.
- C4: C1 holds or C3 holds.
- C5: eventually C4 holds (i.e., at some future time C4 becomes true).

Trace on the timeline
- We have event2 at t0 and again at t2 (and again at t4, ...).
- Once the second event2 has occurred (at t2), C1 is satisfied (two event2 occurrences exist).
- Thus at t2, C4 (C1 or C3) becomes true (C1 already true).
- Therefore C4 does eventually hold (indeed by t2), so C5 is true.

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- From the context: event1 has already happened initially, and “after event1 no other events can happen.” That prevents event2 from ever occurring at any later time.

- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is therefore false. So C2 (¬C1) is true now.

- C3 says C2 holds in the next state. But there is no next state after the terminal event1 (no further events can occur), so C3 does not hold (there is no next-state instance where C2 is evaluated as true).

- C4 (""eventually C3"") therefore is false because C3 never becomes true. And C5 (""eventually C4"") is also false because C4 never becomes true.

Thus C5 is False.
---
Answer: True.

Reasoning step-by-step

1. What is being asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true under the given context.

2. Understand the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (this is irrelevant if event2 never occurs).
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred, no future events occur (in particular, event2 never occurs after that initial occurrence).

3. Evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Given event1 has already happened and no events can occur afterward, event2 never happens → C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Because nothing changes after the initial state (no events occur, so the truth of C1/C2 is unchanged), C2 is also true in the next state → C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 already holds in the next state, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" C4 already holds, so C5 is true.

4. Caveat (modeling detail)
- This reasoning assumes there is a next state (time can advance) even though no events occur there. If the model had no successor state at all (so the ""next"" operator is undefined/false), then C3 would be false and the chain would fail. Under the usual interpretation where time progresses but no new events occur, the conclusion above holds.

Therefore, under the standard reading, C5 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify what’s asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""Event1 happens or C4 holds"") is true given the context and the conditions C1–C4.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So ""Event1 happens"" is true (it occurs at the start).
- After event1 no other events can happen, so event2 never occurs after the initial event1 (indeed no other events occur at all).
- The ""after event2, event1 must happen"" clause is irrelevant because event2 never occurs in any timeline consistent with the context.

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is just a redundant conjunction of the fact that event1 happens, so C1 is true (because event1 did happen initially).
- C3 is identical to C1, so C3 is also true.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Even if interpreted strictly, we don’t need C2 to be true because C3 is true; but in any natural reading C1 is a true fact of the model and so C2 or C3 will make C4 true.
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" Since C3 is true, C4 is true.
- C5: ""Event1 happens or C4 holds."" Both disjuncts are true (event1 happens is true; C4 is true), so C5 is true.

Final answer
True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the context: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So the atomic statement ""Event1 happens"" is true.
- C1 and C3 are ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"", which is just a redundant conjunction of a true fact, so C1 and C3 are true.
- C4 is ""C2 holds or C3 holds"". Regardless of C2, C3 is true, so C4 is true.
- C5 is ""Event1 happens or C4 holds"". Since ""Event1 happens"" is true, the disjunction is true.

Therefore C5 is True.

First: the question asks whether C5 (""Event1 happens or C4 holds"") is true given the context.

Given context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1 no other events can happen (so event1 occurs and the run is terminal).
- (Also: after event2, event1 must happen — irrelevant because event2 cannot occur after the initial event1.)

Examine the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — equivalent to ""Event1 happens"". That is true (event1 happened initially).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — this would require C1 at every time point; since C1 is an instantaneous occurrence at the start, C2 need not hold. (C2 is not needed for the final result.)
- C3: same as C1, so true.
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds"" — since C3 is true, C4 is true.
- C5: ""Event1 happens or C4 holds"" — event1 happens is true, and C4 is also true, so the disjunction is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning, step by step:

- C1 and C2 are the same claim: ""event1 eventually happens."" Because event1 already happened initially, C1 and C2 are true at the initial time (F p holds when p holds now).
- C3 is C1 or C2, so C3 is true at the initial time.
- But the context also says ""after event1, no other events can happen."" That means no future occurrence of event1 is possible after the initial occurrence. At times after the initial moment, ""event1 eventually happens"" is false (there is no future time at which event1 occurs).
- Therefore C3 is not true at all times; C3 fails at times after the initial moment, so C4 (""C3 always holds"") is false.
- C5 is ""C4 eventually holds"" — since C4 is never true at any time (it is already false right after the initial moment and can never become true), C5 is false.

Hence C5 is False.
---
Step 1 — read the context:
- At time 0 (initially) event1 happened.
- Rule: after event2, event1 must happen.
- Rule: after event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 2 — evaluate C1–C5:
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True at time 0 because event1 already happened.
- C2: same as C1, so True at time 0.
- C3: ""C1 or C2"" is True at time 0.
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" means at every time point, C3 must hold. But after time 0 there are no further events (because event1 occurred and blocks all future events), so event1 will not occur at any future time >0. Thus at any time >0, ""event1 eventually happens"" (from that time) is false, so C3 is false at those times. Therefore C4 is false (it does not hold at all times).
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" asks whether there is some time after which C4 is true. Since C4 is already false at time 0 and cannot become true later (the same argument: after event1 no future occurrence of event1 can make C1 true at all future times), C4 will never hold at any time. So C5 is false.

False

Sample responses:
Answer: True

Step-by-step reasoning

- Identify the question: Is C5, the formula ""if C1 then C4"" (C1 → C4), true given the setup?

- Restate the conditions:
  - C1 = (event2 ∧ event1).
  - C2 = (event2 ∧ event1) (same as C1).
  - C3 = next(C2) = next(event2 ∧ event1).
  - C4 = event2 ∨ C3 = event2 ∨ next(event2 ∧ event1).
  - C5 = C1 → C4.

- Logical check: If C1 holds in a state then event2 holds in that state (because C1 is event2 ∧ event1). But C4 is a disjunction whose first disjunct is event2. Therefore whenever C1 holds, event2 is true, so event2 ∨ next(event2 ∧ event1) is true. Hence C1 implies C4.

- Context does not change this: even if the context makes C1 impossible, the implication C1 → C4 would be vacuously true. If C1 can hold (both events in the same state), it still guarantees C4 by the argument above.

Therefore C5 is True.
---
You're asked whether C5 (""If C1 holds, then C4 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 1 — what the context says
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred, no future event (including event2) can occur.
- After event2, event1 must happen. (This only matters if event2 could occur.)

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" Given the context, event1 already happened initially, but no events can happen after that, so event2 cannot happen at any time. Therefore C1 is impossible (false in every reachable model).
- C2 is the same as C1, so also impossible.
- C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is false because C2 is impossible.
- C4 (""Event2 happens or C3 holds"") is false because both disjuncts are false.
- C5 is the implication C1 → C4.

Step 3 — reason about the implication
- An implication with an impossible antecedent is vacuously true. Since C1 cannot hold under the given context, there is no model in which C1 is true and C4 false. Therefore C5 must hold in all models consistent with the context.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- C1 is ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" So if C1 holds then, in particular, Event2 happens (the left disjunct of C4).
- C4 is ""Event2 happens or C3 holds."" Since C1 implies Event2 happens, C4 is immediately satisfied whenever C1 holds.
- The background constraints (initially event1 happened; after event1 no other events can happen; after event2 event1 must happen) do not change that logical implication. Even if those constraints make C1 impossible, the implication ""If C1 then C4"" is vacuously true.

Therefore C5 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
First, what is being asked: is C5 true (in the initial state)?

Set up the timeline from the context:
- S0 (initial): event2 happened.
- By ""after event2, event1 must happen"", the next state S1 has event1.
- By ""after event1, no other events can happen"", S1 is terminal (no further events).

Now evaluate the conditions (we evaluate truth relative to the current state; ""next"" refers to the immediate successor):

- C1: ""event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is true at S0 (event2 happened there). It is false at S1 (event2 does not happen at S1).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" From S0 this is false because C1 fails at S1. From S1 it is also false because C1 is false at S1. So C2 is false in both S0 and S1.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false, C3 is true in both S0 and S1.
- C4: ""C3 holds and event1 happens."" At S0 event1 does not happen, so C4 is false at S0. At S1, C3 holds and event1 does happen, so C4 is true at S1.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" At S0 the next state is S1, and C4 is true at S1. Therefore C5 is true at S0.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

1. Build the timeline from the context:
   - s0 (initial): event2 happens.
   - By “after event2, event1 must happen,” there is a next state s1 with event1.
   - By “after event1, no other events can happen,” no further event occurrences occur after s1.

2. Evaluate the conditions state by state:
   - C1 (“event2 happens and event2 happens”) is true in s0 (event2 holds) and false in s1 (event1 holds instead).
   - C2 (“C1 always holds”) is false (C1 does not hold in s1).
   - C3 (“C2 does not hold”) is therefore true (C2 is false).
   - C4 (“C3 holds and event1 happens”) holds in s1: C3 is true and event1 happens in s1.

3. C5 asserts that “C4 holds in the next state.” At the initial state s0, the next state is s1, and we just saw C4 holds in s1. Therefore C5 is true.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Timeline from the context:
  - State0 (initial): event2 happens.
  - State1 (after event2): event1 must happen.
  - State2 and onward (after event1): no events happen.

- Evaluate the conditions:
  - C1: ""event2 happens and event2 happens"" — equivalent to ""event2 happens"". True at State0, false at State1 and later.
  - C2: ""C1 always holds"" — false, because C1 is true at State0 but false at State1.
  - C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — true (negation of the false C2); so C3 holds at State0 and at State1.
  - C4: ""C3 holds and event1 happens"" — true at State1 (C3 true there and event1 happens there), false at State0.
  - C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" — evaluated at State0: the next state is State1, and C4 is true at State1, so C5 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what's asked
- Is C4 true given the context?

Step 2 — restate conditions
- C1: event1 → event2.
- C2: C1 ∨ event1.
- C3: C1 ∨ event1.
- C4: C2 ∨ C3.

Step 3 — what the context gives
- event2 happens initially.
- After event2, event1 must happen → event1 does happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen (irrelevant to the disjunctions except to confirm no further events).

Step 4 — evaluate the hypothesis
- Since event1 happens, C2 = (C1 ∨ event1) is true (because event1 is true). Same for C3.
- Therefore C4 = C2 ∨ C3 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Initially event2 happened → event2 is true.
- After event2, event1 must happen → given event2, event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen → nothing follows event1 (irrelevant for the disjunctions).

Step 2 — evaluate conditions:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Since event2 already happened initially (so event2 is true), C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" C1 is true, so C2 is true.
- C3: same as C2, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" Both C2 and C3 are true, so C4 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Answer: True

Brief justification (concise, non-secret-chain explanation):
- From the context: event2 occurred, and event1 must follow event2, so both event2 and event1 are true in this scenario.
- C1 (event1 → event2) is true because the consequent event2 is true.
- C2 is (C1 ∨ event1); since event1 is true, C2 is true. C3 is identical, so also true.
- C4 is (C2 ∨ C3), hence true."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s asked
- C5 says: “C4 does not hold.” We must decide whether that formula is true given the context.

Step 2 — restate the conditions
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 ever occurs, event2 must occur afterwards).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — possible event traces
- Because event2 happens initially and after event2 no other events can happen, there are no subsequent events; the system is already at a terminal state with event2 having occurred. Hence event1 never occurs at any time in any trace consistent with the context.

Step 4 — evaluate C1–C5
- C1: “event1 happens or event2 happens” — true (event2 did happen).
- C2: “event1 happens and C1 holds” — false (event1 does not happen).
- C3: “C2 always holds” — false (C2 is false in the initial/only state).
- C4: “C3 holds in the next state” — false (there is no next state after the terminal state with event2; standard “next” is false at a terminal state).
- C5: “C4 does not hold” — true (C4 is false, so its negation is true).

Final answer
True
---
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Goal: determine whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is true given the context.

2. Context summary:
   - Initially, event2 happened.
   - After event1, event2 must happen.
   - After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has occurred, event1 can never occur later).

3. Evaluate the conditions:
   - C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" At the initial state event2 happened, so C1 is true there.
   - C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" This requires event1 to happen. But event1 does not happen initially (only event2 did), and because after event2 no other events can happen, event1 never happens later either. So C2 is false in every state.
   - C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is false (it fails at the initial state and everywhere), C3 is false.
   - C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" C3 is false in the next state as well, so C4 is false.
   - C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Because C4 is false, C5 is true.

Therefore C5 is True.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Goal: decide whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true given the context.

Context summary:
- Initially (state s0) event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 occurs at s1).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so from s1 onward no event1 will occur).

Interpret the Ci as temporal propositions:
- C1 = ""event1 happens in the next state"" (X event1).
- C2 = ""not C1"".
- C3 = ""if event1 happens then C2"" (event1 -> not X event1).
- C4 = ""C3 eventually holds"" (F C3).
- C5 = ""C4 always holds"" (G F C3).

Step-by-step evaluation on the trace:
1. s0: event1 is true (by context); s1: event2 is true; after s1 no events occur.
2. At s0, C1 (X event1) is false because in the next state s1 event2 occurs, not event1. So C2 is true at s0.
3. At s0, C3 (event1 -> C2): antecedent is true (event1 at s0), consequent C2 is true, so C3 is true at s0.
4. At s1 (and any later states) event1 is false, so the implication in C3 is vacuously true; hence C3 is true at s1 and all later states.
5. Therefore C3 holds immediately (at every state), so C4 = F C3 is true at every state (C3 already holds now).
6. Since C4 holds in every state, C5 = G F C3 is true.

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C1 holds and C4 holds"") is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition using the context
- Context: Initially event2 happened. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, no other events can happen.
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True (event2 happened initially).
- C2: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Same as C1, so True.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is True, C3 is False.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" C3 is False, so C4 is True.

Step 3 — combine for C5
- C5 = C1 holds AND C4 holds. We have C1 = True and C4 = True, so C5 = True.

Final answer: True

Goal: decide whether C5 (C1 holds and C4 holds) is true.

Step 1 — what is asked:
- We must evaluate the truth of C5 given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context:
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 has already occurred.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur sometime after the initial event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — evaluate each condition:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True, because event2 already happened initially.
- C2: same as C1, so True.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is True, C3 is False.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is False, C4 is True.
- C5: ""C1 holds and C4 holds."" Both are True, so C5 is True.

Check for conflicts: the requirement that event1 must follow event2 and that no events occur after event1 do not contradict the truth values above.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must determine whether C5 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — unpack the context
- Initially, event2 has already happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur sometime after the initial moment).
- After event1, no further events can occur. (That only prevents events after event1; it does not undo events that already happened.)

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given event2 already happened initially, C1 is true.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is true, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" C3 is false, so C4 is true. (Note C4 is logically equivalent to C2 here.)
- C5: ""C1 holds and C4 holds."" Both C1 and C4 are true, so C5 is true.

Step 4 — timeline consistency
- Initial event2 → forces event1 later → then no further events. This timeline is consistent with C1–C5 as evaluated above.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Context: event2 happened initially, and after event2 no other events can happen. So event1 does not happen.
- C1 asserts event1 happens (twice), so C1 is false.
- C2 and C3 both assert ""C1 holds and event2 happens"" — they are identical and false (because C1 is false).
- C4 is the implication ""if C2 holds, then C3 holds."" Since C2 and C3 are the same, any case where C2 holds, C3 also holds; and in the actual situation C2 is false so the implication is vacuously true.
- Therefore C4 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C4 is the statement ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" We must decide whether that implication is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has happened, event1 cannot happen afterward).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 would also be terminal).

Step 3 — evaluate C1–C3
- C1 = ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — equivalent to ""event1 happens."" Given that event2 happened initially and prevents any other events, event1 does not happen. So C1 is false.
- C2 = ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false (even though event2 did happen).
- C3 = same as C2 (text identical), so C3 is also false.

Step 4 — evaluate C4 (""If C2 holds, then C3 holds"")
- C2 and C3 are identical, so if C2 were true then C3 would certainly be true.
- More generally, a material implication is true whenever the antecedent is false; here the antecedent C2 is false, so the implication is true.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- The question asks whether C4 (""If C2 holds, then C3 holds"") is true given the context.
- Context: event2 happened initially, and after event2 no other events can happen. So event1 does not happen (it cannot occur after the initial event2).
- C1 asserts event1 happens (twice, but that just asserts event1 occurs). Therefore C1 is false in the context.
- C2 is ""C1 holds and event2 happens"" — since C1 is false, C2 is false (even though event2 did happen).
- C3 is identical to C2, so C3 is also false.
- An implication ""If C2 then C3"" is true whenever the antecedent (C2) is false. Also, C2 and C3 are identical, so the implication is trivially true in any case.

Thus C4 is True."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Initially event1 has happened (so event1 is true at the initial state).
- After event1 no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, event2 cannot occur later).
- After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant here because event2 cannot happen given the first two facts).

Step 2 — examine the conditions:
- C1 = ""event2 happens and event2 happens"" ⇔ event2 happens.
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" ⇔ eventually event2 happens.
- C3 = ""C2 holds in the next state"" (some future-state eventuality about event2).
- C4 = ""C3 holds or event1 happens"".
- C5 = ""C4 holds or event1 happens"".

Step 3 — evaluate at the initial state:
- event1 is true initially, so ""event1 happens"" is true.
- Therefore C4 is true (since C4 is C3 or event1, and event1 is true).
- Therefore C5 is true (since C5 is C4 or event1, and C4 is true).

Conclusion:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We are asked whether C5 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — restate context
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 is true at the initial state).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so no events, including event2, can occur at any later time).
- After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — equivalent to ""Event2 happens"". Given the context, event2 cannot happen (because event1 already happened and no other events can happen afterward). So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — false because C1 never becomes true.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — false because C2 is false.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens"" — event1 already happened initially, so this disjunction is true.
- C5: ""C4 holds or event1 happens"" — since C4 is true (and event1 is also true), C5 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 holds or event1 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened (so at the initial state ""event1 happens"" is true).
- After event1, no other events can happen → no events (including event2) can occur at or after the initial state.
- After event2, event1 must happen → irrelevant here because event2 can never occur (due to the prior point).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""event2 happens and event2 happens"" — equivalent to ""event2 happens"". Given the context, event2 never occurs, so C1 is false in every state.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — false, because C1 never becomes true.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — false, since C2 is false.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens"" — this is true at the initial state because ""event1 happens"" is true there (even though C3 is false).

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
You ask whether C5 is true or false. Answer: True.

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Let E2 mean ""event2 happens (in the current state)"". At the initial state S0, E2 is true (given).
- C1 = not E2. So C1 is false at S0.
- C2 = E2 or C1 = E2 or (not E2). This is a classical tautology (either E2 or not E2), so C2 is true in every state (including S0 and all future states).
- C3 = ""C2 holds in the next state."" Since C2 is true in every state, C3 is true in every state (the next state's C2 is true).
- C4 = ""C3 eventually holds."" Because C3 is already true (in fact in every state), C4 is true.
- C5 = ""C4 holds in the next state."" Since C4 holds in every state, C5 is true at the initial state.

Therefore C5 is True.
---
What is being asked
- We must determine whether C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"") is true in the initial situation given the context.

Interpretation and timeline
- States: s0 = initial state, s1 = the state after s0, s2 = after s1, etc.
- Context: event2 happened initially (so event2 holds at s0). After event2, no other events can happen (so from s1 onward no events occur). Also ""after event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant because event1 never occurs.

Evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
  - At s0: false (event2 happened).
  - At s1 and later: true (no events happen after s0).
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds.""
  - At s0: true (event2 happens).
  - At s1 and later: true (C1 holds there).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state.""
  - At s0: requires C2 at s1 — C2 is true at s1, so C3 is true at s0.
  - At s1: requires C2 at s2 — C2 is true at s2, so C3 is true at s1.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds.""
  - At s0: C3 already holds (at s0), so C4 is true at s0.
  - At s1: C3 holds at s1, so C4 is true at s1.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state.""
  - At s0: requires C4 at s1 — we found C4 is true at s1, so C5 is true at s0.

Conclusion
- C5 is True.

Step 1 — what is being asked
C5 is the claim ""C4 does not hold."" We must decide whether C5 is true or false given the context and the definitions C1–C4.

Step 2 — restate the context
- Initially, event1 happened (call this state s0).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so from s0 the next state s1 has event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen (s1 is terminal; s2 has no events).

Step 3 — examine each condition along the timeline
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens.""
  - True in s0 (event1 happened) and true in s1 (event2 happened).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., XC1).
  - At s0 the next state is s1, and C1 holds in s1 (event2), so C2 is true at s0.
  - At s1 the next state s2 has no events, so C1 is false in s2; thus C2 is false at s1.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens"" (C2 -> event1).
  - At s0, C2 is true and event1 is true (it happened initially), so C3 is true at s0.
  - At s1, C2 is false (as noted), so C3 is vacuously true at s1.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" (i.e., XC3).
  - At s0 the next state is s1, and C3 is true in s1, so C4 is true at s0.

Step 4 — evaluate C5
- C5 asserts ""C4 does not hold"" at the current (initial) state s0.
- We found C4 is true at s0, so C5 is false.

Final answer:
False

Step 1 — what’s being asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C3 holds or C4 holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Since event1 happened initially, that blocks any further events from ever happening.
- In particular, event2 cannot happen (there is no time after event1 when event2 could occur).

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is true (no events can happen after the initial event1).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is the negation of C1, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 is false and there is no change possible that would make it true later, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""Event2 does not happen."" Same as C1, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" Since C4 is true, the disjunction is true.

Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- (Also: after event2 no other events can happen, but that only matters if event2 happens.)

Step 2 — evaluate conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Since event1 already happened and no other events can happen after event1, event2 cannot happen. So C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" That is the negation of C1, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 is false and nothing can change that, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""Event2 does not happen."" Same as C1, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" C3 is false but C4 is true, so the disjunction is true.

Final answer: True

We are asked whether C5 is true or false.

Context summary:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Because event1 already happened initially and nothing can happen after event1, event2 does not (and cannot) happen.

Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" — True (event2 cannot occur after the initial event1).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" — False (C1 does hold).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" — False (C2 is false now and no further events/changes can occur).
- C4: ""Event2 does not happen."" — True (same as C1).
- C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" — True (C3 is false but C4 is true, so the disjunction is true).

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- The hypothesis asks whether C4 (""C2 holds or C3 holds"") is true.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (an implication with the same antecedent and consequent) — it holds unconditionally.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Since C1 is true regardless of whether event2 happens, the implication ""event2 → C1"" is true (a consequent that is always true makes the implication true).
- C3: same as C2, so it is also true.

Step 3 — combine for C4
- C4 is ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" Both C2 and C3 are true, so their disjunction is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C2 holds or C3 holds"") is true or false given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautological implication (P → P), so C1 is true in all circumstances.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Since C1 is already true unconditionally, the implication in C2 is true as well (an implication with a true consequent is true).
- C3 is identical to C2, so it is also true.

Step 3 — combine for C4
- C4 is ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" Both C2 and C3 hold, so their disjunction C4 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C4 (""C2 holds or C3 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautological implication (A → A), so C1 is always true.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Since C1 is always true, C2 is true whenever considered (the consequent is true unconditionally).
- C3: same as C2, so C3 is true for the same reason.
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" A disjunction of two true statements is true.

Step 3 — note about the context
- The context (event2 happened initially; after event1 event2 must happen; after event2 no other events) does not conflict with any of the C1–C4 truths and in particular ensures event2 does occur, which makes the antecedents relevant, but C1–C3 are already true regardless.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is true or false given the context rules about events.

Step 2 — restate the context rules
- Initially, event2 occurs.
- After event1, event2 must occur (so event1 is always followed later by event2).
- After event2, event1 must occur (so event2 is always followed later by event1).
These rules force an alternating sequence of events starting with event2: e2, then e1, then e2, then e1, ... indefinitely.

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Interpreting this as: whenever event2 occurs it is eventually followed by event1. That holds by the given rule. So C1 is true.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" At the initial moment event2 does happen, and we just established C1, so C2 is true at the start.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" That would require that at every moment in time both (a) event2 happens at that moment and (b) C1 holds. While C1 holds globally, event2 does not hold at every moment (it only holds at alternating instants). Thus C2 is not true at every moment, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" That would mean there is some time after which C3 holds forever. Since C3 is false at times when event1 (not event2) occurs, and the sequence keeps alternating forever, C3 can never become true permanently. So C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is false, its negation is true.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. The context forces alternation: start with event2; after event2 event1 must occur; after event1 event2 must occur. So the trace is ... event2, event1, event2, event1, ...
2. C1 (""If event2 happens, then event1 happens"") matches the rule and holds.
3. C2 (""Event2 happens and C1 holds"") is true at the initial moment (event2 happened and C1 holds).
4. C3 (""C2 always holds"") would require that at every future moment event2 happens (and C1 holds). But events alternate, so there are moments when event1 happens and event2 does not. Therefore C3 never holds.
5. C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is false because C3 never becomes true at any future point.
6. C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is therefore true.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
You ask whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is true or false given the context and the chain of conditions C1–C4.

Step 2 — interpret the context and each condition
- Context: Initially event2 happened. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, event1 must happen. So the system produces an infinite alternating sequence: event2 (initial), then event1, then event2, then event1, ... — both events occur infinitely often but they alternate.
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Given ""after event2, event1 must happen,"" C1 is true (event2 is always followed by event1).
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" C1 holds, and event2 does happen (initially and repeatedly), so C2 is true at the times when event2 occurs (indeed true at infinitely many time points, including initially).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" This requires C2 to be true at every time point. But C2 includes ""event2 happens,"" which is false at times when event1 occurs. Therefore C2 is not true at those times, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" For C3 to eventually hold, there would have to be some time after which C2 holds at every subsequent time. That would require event2 to occur at every future time point, which does not happen (events alternate). So C3 will never become true at any time; thus C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is false, the statement ""C4 does not hold"" is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C5 is ""C4 does not hold."" We must decide whether C5 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — interpret each condition:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens."" This is equivalent to Event1 happens.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is Event1 happens.
- C3: ""Event2 happens and C2 holds."" So C3 means Event2 happens AND Event1 happens.
- C4: ""C1 holds and C3 holds."" So C4 means Event1 happens AND (Event2 happens AND Event1 happens) — equivalently, Event2 happens and Event1 happens.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" So C5 is true exactly when it is not the case that both Event2 and Event1 happen.

Step 3 — apply the context:
- Initially Event2 happened (so Event2 is true).
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — therefore Event1 will happen after Event2 (so Event1 is true).
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" only forbids events after Event1; it does not prevent Event1 from occurring after Event2.

Thus both Event2 and Event1 happen, so C4 holds.

Therefore C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C5 is ""C4 does not hold."" The question asks whether C5 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — simplify each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" simplifies to: Event1 happens.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 = Event1 happens.
- C3: ""Event2 happens and C2 holds"" = Event2 happens AND Event1 happens.
- C4: ""C1 holds and C3 holds"" = (Event1 happens) AND (Event2 happens AND Event1 happens) = Event1 happens AND Event2 happens.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" = NOT (Event1 happens AND Event2 happens) = (not Event1) OR (not Event2).

Step 3 — use the context to evaluate events
- Initially, Event2 happened → Event2 is true.
- After Event2, Event1 must happen → Event1 does happen (after Event2).
- After Event1 no other events can happen — not needed further, but consistent.

Thus both Event2 and Event1 happen.

Step 4 — evaluate C4 and C5
- C4 (Event1 and Event2) is true.
- C5 is the negation of C4, so C5 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
C5 is ""C4 does not hold."" We must determine whether C5 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — simplify the conditions
- C1: Event1 happens or event1 happens → equivalent to: Event1 happens.
- C2: same → Event1 happens.
- C3: Event2 happens and C2 holds → Event2 happens AND Event1 happens.
- C4: C1 holds and C3 holds → Event1 happens AND (Event2 happens AND Event1 happens) → equivalent to: Event1 happens AND Event2 happens.
- C5: C4 does not hold → NOT(Event1 happens AND Event2 happens).

Step 3 — use the context
- Initially, event2 happened → Event2 happens is true.
- After event2, event1 must happen → since event2 occurred, event1 must (and therefore does) happen.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" does not prevent event1 from occurring after event2; it only forbids events after event1, but event2 already happened before event1.

Thus both Event2 and Event1 happen, so C4 is true.

Step 4 — conclusion
C5 = NOT(C4) is therefore False.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Initially event2 happened, so ""event2 eventually happens"" (C1) is true (it already occurred).
- C2 = (C1 or event2 happens) is true because C1 is true.
- C3 = (C2 eventually holds) is true because C2 holds now (eventually includes the current state).
- C4 = (event1 happens or C3 holds) is true because C3 holds.

Now evaluate C5: ""C4 holds in the next state.""

- The context says: after event2, no other events can happen. Since event2 happened initially, there is no future occurrence of event1 or event2 after the initial state. In standard temporal semantics this means either there is no next state (so the next operator is false) or the next state cannot make event1 true nor can it reestablish C2 (so C3 would not become true there).
- Therefore C4 does not hold in the next state (there is no next state where C4 is true), so C5 is false.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Interpret ""eventually"" as ""at some time now or in the future"" and assume there is a next state (but no further events happen after event2).

- State0 (initial): event2 has happened. Because event2 holds at state0:
  - C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is true at state0.
  - C2 (""C1 holds or event2 happens"") is true at state0.
  - C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true at state0 (since C2 holds now).
  - C4 (""event1 happens or C3 holds"") is true at state0 (C3 holds).

- Consider State1 (the next state). By the context, after event2 no other events can happen, so in particular event2 does not happen again and event1 will not happen in the future.
  - C1 at state1: ""event2 eventually happens"" is false (no future event2).
  - C2 at state1: ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" is false.
  - C3 at state1: ""C2 eventually holds"" is false (C2 will never hold in the future).
  - C4 at state1: ""event1 happens or C3 holds"" is false.

- C5 states ""C4 holds in the next state."" But C4 is false in state1, so C5 is false (at the initial state).

Therefore C5 is False.
---
C5 is False.

Reasoning step-by-step (states s0 = initial, s1 = next):

- s0: event2 happened. Also ""after event2 no other events can happen"", so from s1 onward no events occur.
- C1 = ""event2 eventually happens"". True at s0 (it already happened at s0).
- C2 = ""C1 holds or event2 happens"". True at s0 (C1 is true).
- C3 = ""C2 eventually holds"". True at s0, because C2 holds at s0.
- C4 = ""event1 happens or C3 holds"". True at s0, because C3 holds.
- C5 = ""C4 holds in the next state"" — i.e., is C4 true at s1?

Now evaluate at s1:
- No events occur at s1, so event2 is not true at s1.
- C1 at s1 (""event2 eventually happens"" from s1) is false (no future event2).
- Thus C2 at s1 is false (neither C1 nor event2).
- C3 at s1 (""eventually C2"") is false (C2 never becomes true in the future).
- C4 at s1 (""event1 or C3"") is false.
Therefore C4 does not hold at s1, so C5 is false."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
First identify the question: we must decide whether C5 (""If C3 holds, then C4 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Context summary:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has happened, the timeline is finished; no event2 can ever occur after the initial event1.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never occurs in this model (event1 already happened initially and stops further events).

Now examine the conditions:
- C1: If event2 happens, then event2 happens. This is a tautology (p → p); it is true in every state (including the initial state).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Because C1 already holds now, the eventuality is satisfied (eventually includes the current moment), so C2 holds.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Same reasoning: C2 holds now, so C3 holds.
- C4: Same as C1, so C4 holds.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" We have C3 true and C4 true, so the implication C3 → C4 is true.

Therefore C5 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the operators and assumptions
- ""Eventually"" means ""at some time now or in the future"" (standard temporal/future operator F).
- From context: event1 already happened and after it no other events can happen, so event2 never actually occurs.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p), true at every time.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 is true now (indeed always), F C1 holds.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Because C2 holds now, F C2 holds.
- C4: same as C1, so true.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" The consequent C4 is true unconditionally, so the implication is true regardless of C3.

Conclusion
C5 is True.
---
Identify the question
- We must decide whether C5 (""If C3 holds, then C4 holds"") is true or false given the context and the other Ci.

Understand the context
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1, no other events can happen — so once event1 has occurred (it has, initially), no further events (including event2) can ever occur.
- After event2, event1 must happen — but event2 never occurs in any trace because event1 already occurred initially; so this constraint is vacuously satisfied.

Examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is the tautology p → p, so C1 is true in every state/tracing; in particular it holds now.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 already holds now, ""eventually C1"" is satisfied. So C2 holds.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 holds now, C3 holds.
- C4: same as C1, a tautology, so C4 holds.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" We have C3 true and C4 true, so the implication is true.

Conclusion

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
Because event2 happened initially and it is terminal, no further events (in particular event1) can ever occur.

- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since event1 never occurs at any time, C2 holds now and at every future state → C3 is true.
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" C1 is true and C3 is true, so the implication C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" From the initial state, the next state exists but no events can happen there (because event2 was terminal). In that next state, event1 still does not happen (so C1 holds there) and C2 continues to hold at all future points (so C3 holds there). Hence C4 holds in the next state, so C5 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Answer: False

Reasoning, step by step:
- The context says initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. So event1 never happens at any time.
- C1 and C2 (""Event1 does not happen"") are therefore true.
- C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true because event1 never happens at any time.
- C4 (""If C1 then C3"") is true (true implies true).
- C5 asserts ""C4 holds in the next state."" But after the initial event2 there is no next state (no further events can occur). With the usual interpretation of the next-state operator, a proposition about the next state is false when no next state exists. Therefore C4 does not hold in a non-existent next state, so C5 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event2 happened, and the context says ""after event2, no other events can happen"" — so the initial state is terminal (there is no successor state).
- Therefore event1 never happens: C1 and C2 are true.
- C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true: since event1 does not happen now and there are no future states in which it could start happening, C2 holds at all states of the trace.
- C4 (""if C1 then C3"") is true because C1 is true and that implies C3.
- C5 asserts that C4 holds in the next state. But there is no next state (the initial state is terminal), and under the usual semantics of ""next"" in temporal logic the formula X φ is false at a state with no successor. Hence C5 is false."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
C5 is the proposition ""If event2 happens, then C4 holds."" We must decide whether C5 is true or false given the context and the other Ci.

Step 2 — facts from the context
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 does happen (in the actual run).
- After event2, no other events can happen. (This just prevents further events after event2.)

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Given the context (event2 happened initially and there is that one run), C1 is true in this situation.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" The consequent (event2 happens) is true in the actual situation, so the implication C2 is true.
- C3: same as C1, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" Since both C2 and C3 are true, C4 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C5
C5 is ""If event2 happens, then C4 holds."" We know event2 does happen, and we have shown C4 is true, so the implication is true.

Final answer
True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context: event2 happened initially, and after event2 no other events can happen. So event2 does happen in the actual run.

- C1 and C3 both state ""Event2 always happens."" In the given scenario event2 does happen; whether you read ""always"" as ""in every possible run"" or simply as ""it does occur here,"" C1/C3 are not going to prevent the rest of the argument. (Even if one insisted C1/C3 were false, see the next point.)

- C2 is the implication ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" An implication is true either if the antecedent is false or the consequent is true. Here the consequent (event2 happens) is true, so C2 is true regardless of C1.

- Therefore C4 = (C2 or C3) is true (since C2 is true).

- C5 is ""If event2 happens, then C4 holds."" Event2 does happen, and C4 holds, so the implication C5 is true.

Thus C5 is True.
---
First identify what is being asked: is C5 true or false given the context?

Examine the statements:
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" (unknown whether true or false from the context alone)
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" This is an implication: if (C1) then (event2). Logically, that implication is true whenever C1 is false (vacuous truth), and if C1 is true then event2 indeed happens (because C1 asserts event2 always happens). So C2 is true in all cases.
- C3: same as C1 (so unknown).
- C4: C2 or C3. Since C2 is true, C4 is true regardless of C3.
- C5: ""If event2 happens, then C4 holds."" C4 is already true unconditionally, so the implication in C5 is true regardless of whether event2 occurs.

Conclusion: C5 is True."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C5 says ""C4 does not hold."" The question: is C5 True or False given the context?

Step 2 — simplify the conditions
- C1: Event2 happens (redundant repetition).
- C2: Event1 happens or Event2 happens.
- C3: Event1 happens or C2 holds ⇒ simplifies to Event1 happens or Event2 happens.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" ⇒ in the next state, (Event1 or Event2) holds.
- C5: not C4 ⇒ in the next state, neither Event1 nor Event2 holds.

Step 3 — use the context about events
- Initially, Event2 happened, so at the initial state C1, C2, C3 are true.
- The context also says: after Event2, no other events can happen. Thus in the next state (the state after the initial one where Event2 already happened), neither Event1 nor Event2 happens.
- Therefore C3 is false in the next state, so C4 is false.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C4 does not hold, so C5 is true.

Final answer:
True

Answer being asked: is C5 true?

Step-by-step reasoning

1. From the context:
   - Initially event2 happened (so event2 is true in the initial state).
   - After event2, no other events can happen (so in the next state no events occur).
   - After event1, event2 must happen (irrelevant here because event1 never occurs after the initial event2).

2. Evaluate the conditions in the initial state:
   - C1: ""event2 or event2"" — true because event2 happened initially.
   - C2: ""event1 or C1"" — true because C1 is true.
   - C3: ""event1 or C2"" — true because C2 is true.
   - So C3 holds in the initial state.

3. Move to the next state (after the initial event2):
   - No events occur in that next state, so event1 is false there and event2 is false there.
   - C1 is false in the next state (event2 does not happen there).
   - C2 is false (neither event1 nor C1 holds).
   - C3 is false (neither event1 nor C2 holds).

4. C4 says ""C3 holds in the next state"" — this is false (we just saw C3 is false in the next state).

5. C5 is ""C4 does not hold"" — therefore C5 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 holds now).
- After event2, no other events can happen (there is no next state after this state).
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs, the next state would have event2).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions now
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — equivalent to event2. This is true now (event2 happened initially).
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"" — true because C1 holds.
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds"" — true because C2 holds.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" There is no next state (no events can happen after event2), so C3 cannot be said to hold in a next state; under standard temporal semantics, a next-state claim is false at a terminal state. Therefore C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" — since C4 is false, C5 is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify goal
- We must decide whether C4 (C2 and C3) is true given the context.

Step 2 — restate context rules
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur (so any occurrence of event1 forces a later event2).
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur (so any occurrence of event2 forces a later event1).

Step 3 — examine conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" (Not needed for the conclusion.)
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds.""
- C3: same as C2.
- C4: C2 and C3.

Step 4 — trace events
- Because event2 happened initially, the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" guarantees that event1 will occur at some later point.
- Therefore ""Event1 happens"" is true.
- Given ""Event1 happens"" is true, each disjunction in C2 and C3 (""Event1 happens or C1 holds"") is true regardless of C1.

Step 5 — conclude
- C2 is true and C3 is true, so C4 (their conjunction) is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C2 holds and C3 holds"") is true or false given the context rules about events.

Step 2 — understand the context rules
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 occurs at the initial moment).
- After event1, event2 must happen (whenever event1 occurs, a subsequent event2 will occur).
- After event2, event1 must happen (whenever event2 occurs, a subsequent event1 will occur).

These rules force an alternating sequence of occurrences starting from the initial event2.

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Interpreting ""always happens"" as ""holds at every moment"" — this is false, because there are moments when event1 occurs (by the alternation), and at those moments event2 does not hold. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" We have C1 false, but from the rules event1 does happen (after the initial event2 there must be an event1). So the disjunction is true. Thus C2 is true.
- C3 is identical to C2, so C3 is also true.
- C4 is C2 and C3; since both are true, C4 is true.

Final answer:
True

Identify the goal:
- We must decide whether C4 (C2 AND C3) is true given the context.

Examine the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
So starting from event2, the rules force an alternating sequence: event2 → event1 → event2 → event1 … Thus event1 does occur (indeed infinitely often).

Examine the conditions:
- C1: Event2 always happens. (Not required to be true for the rest.)
- C2: Event1 happens or C1 holds.
- C3: Event1 happens or C1 holds.
C2 and C3 are identical; each is true if event1 happens or if C1 holds.

Reasoning:
- Since event2 occurred initially and the rules force event1 after event2, event1 does happen. Therefore ""Event1 happens"" is true.
- Given ""Event1 happens"" is true, both C2 and C3 are true (they don't require C1).
- Therefore C4 = C2 AND C3 is true.

- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Since event1 happened initially and no other events can happen after event1, event2 cannot happen in the next state. So C1 is false.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" Both disjuncts are false (C2 is false; event2 does not happen), so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Because C3 is already false at the initial state, C4 is false.
- C5: ""C1 holds or C4 holds."" Both C1 and C4 are false, so C5 is false.

Final answer: False

First: the hypothesis asks whether C5 is true given the context.

Examine the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has happened, there are no subsequent events possible.)
- Also: after event2, event1 must happen — but that rule is irrelevant if event2 never occurs.

Now each condition:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Given that initially event1 has happened and no other events can happen afterward, event2 cannot happen in the next state. So C1 is false.
- C2: same as C1, so false.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" Both disjuncts amount to event2 happening in the (next) state, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Since C3 is already false, C4 is false.
- C5: ""C1 holds or C4 holds."" Both C1 and C4 are false, so C5 is false.

Therefore the answer is: False.

First, what the hypothesis asks: determine whether C5 is true given the context.

Examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Therefore, once that initial event1 has occurred, no events (including event2) can occur at any later state.

Evaluate each condition:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Since no events can occur after the initial event1, event2 cannot happen next — C1 is false.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" Both disjuncts are false, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Because C3 is false at the next (and only) future state, C4 is false.

Sample responses:
First, what is being asked: Is C5 true or false given the context?

Interpretation of context:
- Initially, event2 has happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Examine the conditions one by one:
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" Given event2 has already happened and event2 is terminal (no other events can happen after it), event1 cannot occur after event2. There is no indication event1 happened before or simultaneously; with the given rules, C1 cannot be satisfied. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 already holds now, so ""eventually C2"" is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" But C3 is true, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" There are two ways to see this:
  - Because C4 is false now, it cannot suddenly be true in a next state unless events produce a change. But after event2 no other events can happen, so there is no next state to change things—so C5 is false.
  - Even if one allowed a next state, since C4 is false (C3 is true), C4 would not hold in that next state.

Conclusion: C5 is False.
---
Reasoning:

1. Context: initially event2 happened. Also, after event2 no other events can happen (and likewise after event1 no other events can happen). So the initial state is terminal: event2 has occurred and there is no next state where any further events (including event1) can occur.

2. C1 (""Event2 happens and event1 happens""): cannot hold, because although event2 happened initially, event1 does not (and cannot) happen thereafter. So C1 is false.

3. C2 (""C1 does not hold""): true, since C1 is false.

4. C3 (""C2 eventually holds""): true, because C2 already holds in the initial state (so it holds now, hence eventually).

5. C4 (""C3 does not hold""): false, since C3 is true.

6. C5 (""C4 holds in the next state""): there is no next state (the run is terminal after the initial event2), so C4 cannot hold in a next state. Under standard semantics the next-state claim is false when no next state exists. Therefore C5 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
C5 is False.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Context: initially event2 happened; after event2 (and after event1) no other events can happen. So once event2 has happened (at the initial state), no further events, in particular event1, can occur.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — clarify assumptions
- Events are instantaneous occurrences over time. ""Always"" means ""at every time point"".
- ""Initially, event1 happened"" means event1 occurs at the initial time point.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" means at some later time event2 will occur.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" means event2 is terminal.

Step 2 — evaluate conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Given event1 happened initially and after event1 event2 must happen, event2 does happen. So C1 is False.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false (it actually doesn't hold even at the initial time), C2 is False.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" At the initial time event1 did happen, so C3 is True at that initial time. But C2 is false, and after the initial time event1 no longer holds, so C3 is not true at all times.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Because C3 fails at times after the initial time (C2 is false and event1 no longer holds), C4 is False.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" Since C4 is false, C5 is False.

Final answer:
False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step by step:

1. Timeline from the context:
   - t0 (initial): event1 happens.
   - Because ""after event1, event2 must happen"", event2 occurs at some later time t1.
   - Because ""after event2, no other events can happen"", t1 is terminal (no events after t1).

2. Evaluate the conditions:
   - C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is false (event2 does happen at t1).
   - C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false.
   - C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" At t0, event1 happens, so C3 is true at t0.
   - C4: ""C3 always holds."" For this to be true C3 must be true at every time. At t1, event1 does not ""happen"" (it happened only at t0) and C2 is false, so C3 is false at t1. Therefore C4 is false.
   - C5: ""C4 always holds."" Since C4 is false, C5 is false.

So C5 is False.
---
Answer: False

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. From the context: event1 has occurred initially, and after event1 event2 must occur; after event2 no further events can occur. So event2 does happen (after the initial event1).

2. C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is false because event2 does in fact happen.

3. C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false.

4. C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" At the initial moment this is true (event1 happened). But this is only an instantaneous truth tied to the occurrence of event1; it does not remain true after event2 occurs (C2 is false and event1 is no longer 'happening').

5. C4: ""C3 always holds."" Because C3 becomes false later (after event2), C4 is false.

6. C5: ""C4 always holds."" Since C4 is false, C5 is false.

Therefore C5 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s asked
We must decide whether C5 is true given the context and the listed conditions. C5 is ""Event2 happens and C4 holds.""

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions using the context
- Context: initially event1 happened. So ""Event1 does not happen"" is false.
- C1: Event1 does not happen. => C1 is false.
- C3: Event1 does not happen. => C3 is false (same as C1).
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"" = (Event2) ∨ (false) => C2 ≡ Event2.
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds"" = C2 → C3. Since C3 is false, C2 → C3 is true only when C2 is false. Thus C4 ≡ ¬C2 ≡ ¬(Event2).
- C5: ""Event2 happens and C4 holds"" = (Event2) ∧ ¬(Event2) — a contradiction, always false.

Therefore C5 is False.
---
Step 1 — what is asked
We must decide whether C5 is True or False given the context and the listed conditions.

Step 2 — understand the context
- ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 is true.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" (If event2 occurs, event1 must occur afterward.)
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Once event1 has occurred, no further events (including event2) can occur.

From these, since event1 already happened initially, no other events can happen at any time after that, and there is no earlier time for event2 to occur (event1 is initial). Therefore event2 does not happen.

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" False, because event1 did happen initially.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" Both disjuncts are false (event2 does not happen, C1 is false), so C2 is false.
- C3: ""Event1 does not happen."" Same as C1, so false.
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true, so C4 is true (since C2 is false).
- C5: ""Event2 happens and C4 holds."" Event2 is false while C4 is true, so the conjunction is false.

Final answer:
False
---
We are asked whether C5 (""Event2 happens and C4 holds"") is true given the context.

Step-by-step:

- Context: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 does happen (at the initial time). Also ""after event1, no other events can happen,"" so no events can occur after that initial event1. Thus event2 does not occur at any time.

- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This contradicts the context, so C1 is false.

- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" Since C1 is false and event2 does not happen, C2 is false.

- C3: ""Event1 does not happen."" Same as C1, so C3 is false.

- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C4 is true (because C2 is false).

- C5: ""Event2 happens and C4 holds."" Event2 is false, C4 is true, so the conjunction is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- C1 is ""event1 happens or event1 happens"", i.e. simply ""event1 happens"".
- The context says initially event2 happened and after event2 no other events can happen. Since event2 has already happened initially, event1 does not happen (neither now nor later). So C1 is false in the initial state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" There is no next state (no events can occur after event2), so the next-state claim is false. Hence C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false, C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is true, C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" C4 is false now and there are no future states in which it could become true, so ""eventually C4"" is false.

Therefore C5 is False.
---
Reasoning:

- Initially event2 has happened (call that state s0).
- After event2 no other events can happen, so s0 has no successor states; no event can occur in any future state.
- From ""after event1, event2 must happen"" we get that event1 cannot occur anywhere, because if event1 occurred it would force event2 later, but no events can occur after s0.

Now translate the C-conditions:
- C1: ""event1 happens or event1 happens"" ≡ event1 happens. This is false in every state (event1 never occurs).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" ≡ next(event1). This is false everywhere (there is no state where the next state has event1).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" ≡ ¬C2. This is true everywhere.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" ≡ ¬C3 ≡ C2. So C4 is false everywhere.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" ≡ eventually(C4) ≡ eventually(C2). Since C2 is false in all states, eventually(C2) is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — What is asked
C5 is ""C4 eventually holds."" We must decide whether that is true given the context.

Step 2 — Unpack the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is just the same disjunction twice, so C1 ≡ ""Event1 happens"".
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" ≡ Next(C1) ≡ in the next state, Event1 happens.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" ≡ ¬C2.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" ≡ ¬C3 ≡ C2 (double negation).
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" ≡ Eventually(C4) ≡ Eventually(C2).

So C5 asks: at some future state, will it be true that in the following state Event1 happens?

Step 3 — Use the context to trace possible sequences
- Initially, Event2 has happened.
- After Event2, no other events can happen — so the initial state is terminal: there is no next state and no further events.
- (The rule ""after Event1, Event2 must happen"" is irrelevant because Event1 cannot occur after Event2, and Event1 never occurs here.)

Step 4 — Evaluate the conditions on this trace
- C1 is false (Event1 does not happen).
- C2 = Next(C1) is false in the initial (and only) state because there is no next state (Next(...) is false at a terminal state).
- C4 = C2 is false.
- C5 = Eventually(C2) asks whether C2 is true at some future state; there are no future states, so C2 will never become true.

We are asked whether C5 is true.

Step-by-step:
- From the context: event2 occurred initially, and after event2 event1 must happen, and after event1 event2 must happen. Therefore both event2 and event1 occur.
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" True.
- C2: same as C1. True.
- C3: ""C1 holds and C2 holds."" True (both C1 and C2 are true).
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" False (C3 does hold).
- C5: ""Event1 happens and C4 holds."" Event1 happens (true) but C4 is false, so the conjunction is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — understanding the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After any event2, event1 must happen (so event1 occurs at least once after that event2).
- After any event1, event2 must happen (so event2 occurs again after each event1).
Thus events alternate: event2, event1, event2, event1, ... — both event1 and event2 occur (infinitely often).

Step 2 — evaluate each condition:
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" True (both occur).
- C2: Same as C1, so True.
- C3: ""C1 holds and C2 holds."" Since C1 and C2 are both True, C3 is True.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" But C3 is True, so C4 is False.
- C5: ""Event1 happens and C4 holds."" Event1 happens (True) but C4 is False, so the conjunction is False.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- The question asks whether C5 (which says ""C4 holds in the next state"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 happened (so at the initial state event1 is true).
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — if event2 ever occurs, event1 must occur thereafter.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — event1 makes the system terminal: there is no further state with any events after the state where event1 holds.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Given the initial state already has event1 and no events can occur after event1, event2 cannot happen. So C1 is False.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" event1 does happen initially, so C2 is True.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is True, C3 is False.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" There is no next state after the state where event1 holds (the state is terminal), and even if a next state existed C3 is False. Under standard ""next"" semantics, X p is False when there is no next state. So C4 is False.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" Same reasoning: C4 is False in the current state and there is no next state to make it true later, so C5 is False.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify what’s asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context and the Ci
- Context: initially event2 happens. After event2, event1 must happen in the next state. After event1, event2 must happen in the next state. So the states alternate: s0: event2, s1: event1, s2: event2, s3: event1, ...
- C1: event1 happens in the next state.
- C2: same as C1.
- C3: C1 and C2 — equivalent to ""event1 happens in the next state.""
- C4: C3 always holds — i.e., at every state, the next state has event1.
- C5: C4 holds in the next state — i.e., at the state s1 (the next state from the initial), C4 is true.

Step 3 — trace the sequence and evaluate
- At initial state s0: next state s1 has event1, so C1, C2, C3 are true at s0.
- But at s1: next state s2 has event2, so C3 is false at s1.
- Since C3 is not true at every state, C4 (""always C3"") is false at s0.
- Consequently, at s1, C4 is also false (because C3 already fails at s1), so C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"") is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context and timeline
- Initially (state s0) event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so at s1 event1 occurs).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so at s2 event2 occurs).
- Thus the states alternate: s0: event2, s1: event1, s2: event2, s3: event1, ...

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" At s0 this is true (s1 has event1).
- C2: same as C1, so also true at s0.
- C3: C1 and C2 — true at s0.
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" meaning at every state t ≥ current, event1 happens in t+1. For C4 to hold at a state, every next state must be event1. But at s1 the next state s2 has event2, so C3 fails at s1. Therefore C4 is false (it does not hold globally).
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" — this asks whether C4 is true at s1. As just shown, C4 is false at s1.

Final answer
False
---
You're asking whether C5 is true given the context. Step-by-step:

1. Context gives an alternation:
   - s0 (initial): event2.
   - After event2, event1 must happen → s1: event1.
   - After event1, event2 must happen → s2: event2.
   - And so on: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...

2. Evaluate the conditions at the initial state s0:
   - C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" — at s0 the next state s1 has event1 → True.
   - C2: same as C1 → True.
   - C3: C1 and C2 → True.
   - C4: ""C3 always holds"" means C3 must hold at every state. But at s1 the next state s2 has event2, so C3 is false at s1. Thus C4 is False.
   - C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" asks whether C4 is true at s1. Since C4 is false (already false at s1), C5 is False.

Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is True or False, given the initial facts and rules about events.

Step 2 — restate the setup
- Initially event1 happened.
- After any occurrence of event1, event2 must happen sometime later (so event1 → eventually event2).
- After any occurrence of event2, event1 must happen sometime later (so event2 → eventually event1).
- From the initial event1 these two rules force an infinite alternation (event2 will occur, then event1 again, then event2, ...).

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True, because after the initial event1 the rule requires event2 at some future time.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" True — in the state immediately after the initial one, event2 still must (and will) happen at some future point.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" True for the same reason: from every state along the infinite alternation, event2 will still occur later, so the nested next conditions remain true.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" True — C3 already holds immediately (and everywhere), so it certainly holds eventually.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" This is the negation of C4; since C4 is True, C5 is False.

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is True or False.

Step-by-step reasoning:

- Context: Initially event2 happened. Also, ""After event2, event1 must happen"" and ""After event1, event2 must happen."" So whenever event2 occurs, the next state must have event1.

- C1/C2: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Given the initial event2 and the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"", C1 (and C2) are true in the initial situation.

- C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds"" — therefore C3 is true (since C1 is true).

- C4: ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds."" This matches the context rule: after event2, event1 must happen, so whenever event2 happens the next state has event1 (i.e., C3). Thus C4 is true.

- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" — since C4 does hold, C5 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the target: C5 is ""C4 does not hold."" So we need to decide whether C4 is true or false.

Step 2 — evaluate C1–C3:
- Context: initially event2 happened, and ""after event2, event1 must happen."" Therefore in the next state event1 happens. So C1 (""Event1 happens in the next state"") is true. C2 is the same and also true. Hence C3 (C1 or C2) is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C4:
- C4 says ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds."" Given the context rule ""after event2, event1 must happen,"" whenever event2 happens the next state has event1, which is exactly C3. So C4 is true.

Step 4 — conclude about C5:
- C5 = ""C4 does not hold"" is the negation of a true statement, so C5 is false.

False
---
Step 1 — what's asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is True or False.

Step 2 — restate given facts
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so whenever event1 occurs, event2 occurs next).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so whenever event2 occurs, event1 occurs next).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1 and C2 both state: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" They are the same.
- C3 = C1 or C2, so C3 is equivalent to ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C4 = ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds."" That is: whenever event2 happens, event1 happens in the next state.
- From the context, ""after event2, event1 must happen"" exactly says that whenever event2 happens, event1 happens next — so C4 is true.

Step 4 — conclude about C5
- C5 asserts that C4 does not hold. But we just established C4 does hold, so C5 is false.

Step 1 — translate the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1 no further events can happen (so event2 cannot occur after the initial event1).
- (Also after event2 no further events can happen, but that’s irrelevant because event2 never occurs.)

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- C1: (event2) OR (event1). Since event1 happened initially, C1 is true initially.
- C2: (event2) AND C1. That is equivalent to event2 (because C1 is event1∨event2). Since event2 cannot occur, C2 is false.
- C3: ""always C2"". C2 is false, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""next C3"" (C3 holds in the next state). C3 is false in all states, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""always C4"". C4 is false, so C5 is false.

Final answer:

You're asking whether C5 is true or false. We'll evaluate each condition given the context.

Context summary (assumption about temporal semantics):
- Initially event1 happened (so at the initial state, event1 is true).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so there is no transition to a state where a new event occurs).
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant here because event2 never occurs).
I assume standard temporal semantics where ""next"" (X φ) is false at a state with no successor.

Step-by-step:
1. C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" Since event1 has happened initially, C1 is true in the initial state.
2. C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" This requires event2 to happen. But after event1 no further events can happen, so event2 never happens. Thus C2 is false.
3. C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is already false in the initial state, C3 is false.
4. C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" There is no next state (no further events), so X C3 is false under standard semantics. Thus C4 is false.
5. C5: ""C4 always holds."" Because C4 is false in the initial state, C5 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 has happened (so at the initial state event1 is true).
- After event1, no other events can happen. In particular, once event1 has occurred the system has no further events/transitions.
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant here because event2 does not occur in the given run).

Step 2 — evaluate conditions step by step
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" Since event1 already happened initially, C1 is true at the initial state.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" This requires event2 to happen. But event2 does not occur (because event1 already happened and no further events can happen), so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" C2 is false at the initial state, so it cannot be true at all times; therefore C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" There is no next state after the initial state (no further events/transitions), and under standard next-state semantics the next operator is false at a terminal state. Thus C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" C4 is false, so C5 cannot hold always; C5 is false.

False"

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so the system is already in a state where event1 has occurred and no future events occur).

Step 2 — evaluate each condition:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology; it holds in the current state.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is true now and is a tautology, C2 holds.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" If C2 holds now, then it certainly holds eventually; so C3 holds.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" But we just established C3 does hold, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" C4 is false now; therefore C5 is false (there is no need to rely on existence of a next state).

Final answer:
False
---
First, what's being asked: is C5 true or false?

Examine the conditions step by step.

- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautological implication (p → p), so C1 is true in every state.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is true in every state, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" If C2 holds always, then in particular it holds at some time, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This contradicts C3, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" Because C4 is false, it cannot hold in the next state, so C5 is false.

Therefore C5 is False. Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — model from the context
- Initially event1 happened (so event1 is true in the initial state s0).
- After event1 no other events can happen ⇒ there is no next state after s0 (s0 is terminal).
- (The clause about event2 is irrelevant because event2 never occurs in this execution.)

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautological implication and is true in any state (true at s0).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 holds in every state (and there is only s0), C2 is true at s0.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 already holds immediately at s0, C3 is true at s0.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" But C3 is true, so C4 is false at s0.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" There is no next state after s0 (terminal). Under the usual (strong) semantics of the next operator, Xφ is false when there is no next state, so C5 is false. (Even if one tried to evaluate C4 in a non-existent next state, C4 is false in the only actual state, so C5 cannot be true.)

Conclusion
- C5 is False."

- After event2, no other events can happen.
Therefore event1 does not happen (it cannot occur after event2).

Step 2 — translate the conditions:
- C1: event1 does not happen. (True, by the context.)
- C2: C1 does not hold → equivalently, event1 happens. (False.)
- C3: C2 eventually holds → event1 eventually happens. (False — event1 will never happen after event2.)

- C5: C4 does not hold → (False.)

Final answer:
False

Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2 no other events can happen. (So once event2 has happened, event1 cannot happen later.)
- After event1 no other events can happen. (Symmetrically, but irrelevant if event1 never occurs.)

Step 2 — evaluate conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Given event2 happened initially and no events can happen after it, event1 never happens. So C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is true, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 is false and will remain false, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is false, C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" C4 is true, so C5 is false.

You ask whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is true or false given the context. Step-by-step:

1. Context facts:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
Because event2 happened initially and is terminal, no other events (including event1) ever happen.

2. Evaluate the conditions:

- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" False (negation of a true statement).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" False — C2 is false and cannot become true later, since the facts are settled.

Sample responses:
Goal: decide whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is True or False.

1) From the context:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 has occurred at the start.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Since event1 happened initially, no event can ever happen afterwards (in particular event2 never happens).
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never occurs.

2) Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" This is false (event2 never happens).
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" This implication is vacuously true because its antecedent (event2 happens) never occurs.
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" Event1 did happen initially, and C2 is true, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Given no events ever occur after the initial state, the truth values that made C3 true do not get overturned; C3 remains true at all times. Thus C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is true, C5 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — Identify the question
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is true or false given the context and the conditions C1–C4.

Step 2 — Translate the context
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 has occurred at the initial moment).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 were to occur, it would force event1 afterward).

Step 3 — Evaluate each condition under the context
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" This is false: because event1 happened initially and is terminal, no further events (including event2) can ever occur, so event2 does not always happen (indeed it never happens).
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" This implication is vacuously true, because event2 never happens under the context; an implication with a false antecedent is true.
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" Event1 did happen initially, and C2 is true, so C3 is true (at least at the initial moment).
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" This would require that C3 be true at all times. But C3 requires ""event1 happens"" as part of it; that was an occurrence at the initial moment and is not something that continues to hold at all future times (moreover no new events occur after the initial event, so you cannot make ""event1 happens"" true at later times). Therefore C3 is not true at all times, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since we just concluded C4 is false, C5 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — understand the context
- Initially event1 has happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, event2 can never occur afterwards).
- Therefore, event2 never happens in any reachable timeline.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" False — event2 never happens.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" True — the antecedent (event2 happens) is false, so the implication is vacuously true.
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" True — event1 did happen initially and C2 is true.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" True — C3 is true initially and nothing can happen afterward to change that, so C3 holds in all reachable states.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" False — C4 does hold, so C5 is false.

Reasoning step-by-step:

- From the context: initially event1 happened. Also, “after event1, no other events can happen.” So the initial state has event1 and there is no successor state (no next state) because nothing can happen after event1.

- Evaluate the conditions in the initial state:
  - C1: “Event1 does not happen.” This is false (event1 does happen initially).
  - C3 is the same as C1, so also false.
  - C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” There is no next state, so this is false.
  - C4: “C2 holds or C3 holds” = false or false = false.
  - C5: “C4 holds in the next state.” Again, there is no next state, so this is false.

Therefore C5 is False.
---
We evaluate everything relative to states in time. Let t0 be the initial state (where ""Initially, event1 happened""), and t1 the next state. From the context, event1 happens at t0 and no events happen at t1 or later.

Interpret each condition as a formula evaluated at a state:
- C1 at time t: ""event1 does not happen at that time."" So C1(t0) = False (event1 did happen at t0), while C1(t1) = True (no events at t1).
- C2 at time t: ""C1 holds in the next state"" = C1(t+1). Thus C2(t0) = C1(t1) = True, and C2(t1) = C1(t2) = True (since no events ever occur after t0).
- C3 is the same as C1, so C3(t0) = False and C3(t1) = True.
- C4 at time t: ""C2 holds or C3 holds"" = C2(t) OR C3(t). So C4(t0) = True OR False = True; C4(t1) = True OR True = True.
- C5 at time t: ""C4 holds in the next state"" = C4(t+1). The hypothesis asks whether C5 is true at the initial state t0, so C5(t0) = C4(t1) = True.

Therefore C5 is True.

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Translate the context and formulas:
   - Context: initially event1 happened (so at the current/initial state s0, event1 is true). Also, after event1 no other events can happen (so s0 has no successor state).
   - C1 and C3: “Event1 does not happen” = ¬event1 at the current state.
   - C2: “C1 holds in the next state” = X(¬event1).
   - C4: C2 ∨ C3 = X(¬event1) ∨ ¬event1.
   - C5: “C4 holds in the next state” = X(C4).

2. Evaluate at the initial state s0:
   - Since event1 happened in s0, ¬event1 is false, so C1 and C3 are false.
   - There is no next state after s0 (because after event1 no other events can happen). In standard temporal semantics, X(φ) is false when no successor exists. Thus C2 = X(¬event1) is false.
   - Hence C4 = false ∨ false = false.
   - Finally C5 = X(C4) is false because there is no successor state.

Sample responses:
Goal: decide whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is True or False.

Interpretation (natural temporal reading):
- Initially event1 happens.
- Rule A: after any event2, event1 must happen (so whenever event2 occurs, later event1 occurs).
- Rule B: after any event1, event2 must happen (so whenever event1 occurs, later event2 occurs).

These rules force an infinite alternation starting from the initial event1: event1 (initial) → some later event2 → some later event1 → ... So both events occur repeatedly (infinitely often), but neither holds at all times (they are not continuously true at every moment).

Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Interpreting ""always"" as “at every time” (globally), this is false — event2 does occur repeatedly but not at every instant, so C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" C2 is true at every point in the execution (there is never a moment from which event2 holds at all future times), so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" If C3 holds at every time, it certainly holds eventually, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" But C4 is true, so C5 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Final answer: False

Step-by-step reasoning

1) What is being asked
- We must evaluate whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is true or false given the context and the chain of conditions C1–C4.

2) Understand the context
- Initially event1 happened (so at the initial point e1 holds and e2 does not).
- After event1, event2 must happen (whenever e1 occurs, e2 will occur later).
- After event2, event1 must happen (whenever e2 occurs, e1 will occur later).
This enforces alternation (or at least that each occurrence of one forces a subsequent occurrence of the other), but does not make event2 true at the initial instant.

3) Evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" This would mean e2 holds at every point (or equivalently that event2 occurs at all times). That is false because initially e1 happened and e2 did not. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" C2 is a factual claim that C1 is false; once C2 is true it remains true, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" If C3 is already (always) true, then it certainly eventually holds, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" But C4 is true, so C5 is false.

4) Conclusion
- C5 is False.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is True or False given the event constraints.

Step 2 — interpret the context and temporal operators
- Context: initially event1 occurs. After any event1, an event2 must happen later. After any event2, an event1 must happen later. So starting from the initial event1, the system forces an alternating sequence of event1 and event2 forever; each event will occur again in the future (infinitely often).
- Interpretations: ""always"" means a global (G) property (holds at every time), and ""eventually"" means at some future time (F).

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" ≡ G(event2). This would require event2 to be true at every moment. In the alternating execution, event2 occurs infinitely often but not at every moment/state, so G(event2) is false. Thus C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" ≡ ¬C1. Since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" ≡ G(C2). C2 is a global truth (¬C1) and so is true at all times; hence C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" ≡ F(C3). Since C3 already holds immediately (it’s true now and forever), it certainly holds eventually. So C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" ≡ ¬C4. Because C4 is true, C5 is false.

Sample responses:
We want to know whether C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"") is true.

Step-by-step:

- States: call the initial state S0 and the next state S1.
- Context: in S0 event1 happened. By the context, in S1 event2 must happen (and after event2 no further events can happen).
- Evaluate C2 in S1: C2 is ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" In S1 event1 does not happen (it happened in S0), so the antecedent is false and the implication C2 is true (vacuously).
- Evaluate C3 in S1: C3 is ""Event2 does not happen."" But in S1 event2 does happen, so C3 is false.
- Evaluate C4 in S1: C4 is ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" Since C2 is true in S1 and C3 is false in S1, C4 is false (true → false = false).
- C5 asserts that C4 holds in the next state (i.e., in S1). But we found C4 is false in S1.

Therefore C5 is False.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C5 says: ""C4 holds in the next state."" We must determine whether C4 is true in the state immediately after the initial state.

Step 2 — facts from the context
- In the initial state S0, event1 happened.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" ⇒ in the next state S1, event2 happens.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" ⇒ once event2 has happened (in S1) no further events occur afterward.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions in S1 (the next state)
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" In S1 this is false (event2 does happen in S1).
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" In S1 event1 does not happen (it happened in S0), so the antecedent is false and the implication C2 is true (a false antecedent makes the implication true).
- C3: ""Event2 does not happen."" Same as C1, so C3 is false in S1.
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" In S1 C2 is true and C3 is false, so C4 (true → false) is false in S1.

Step 4 — conclusion about C5
- C5 asserts that C4 holds in the next state (S1). We found C4 is false in S1, so C5 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step-by-step:

- Context: initially event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen, so in the next state event2 does happen. After event2, no further events occur.
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" In the next state this is false (event2 does happen).
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" In the next state event1 does not happen (it happened earlier), so the antecedent is false and C2 is true in the next state.
- C3: same as C1, so C3 is false in the next state.
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" In the next state C2 is true and C3 is false, so C4 is false in the next state.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" Since C4 is false in the next state, C5 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Interpret the background
- Initially event1 happened.
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen. Since event1 already happened initially, no other event (including event2) can happen at any later time.
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen. This is vacuously irrelevant if event2 never happens.

Step 2 — Interpret the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — equivalent to ""event2 happens.""
- C2: same as C1.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Since C1 and C2 are identical, C3 is true in all cases (if event2 happens both hold; if event2 doesn't happen the implication is true because antecedent is false).
- C4: ""Event2 happens or C3 holds."" Because C3 is always true, C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" This is the negation of C4.

Step 3 — Conclusion
- C4 is true, so C5 (its negation) is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
You ask whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is True or False given the context and the listed conditions.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen → no event2 can occur after the initial event1; since event1 is initial, event2 cannot occur at all in the timeline.
- Also: after event2, event1 must happen (not needed for the conclusion below).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — this is just the proposition P: event2 happens.
- C2: same as C1, also P.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"" — i.e. P → P. This is a logical tautology and is always true (true whether P is true or false).
- C4: ""Event2 happens or C3 holds"" — i.e. P ∨ (P → P). Since (P → P) is always true, C4 is true.
  (Even without noting the tautology, the context makes P false; with P false, P→P is true, so C4 is true anyway.)
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" — the negation of C4. Since C4 is true, C5 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We are asked whether C5 (which asserts ""C4 does not hold"") is True or False.

Step 2 — simplify the conditions
- C1: event2 ∧ event2, which is equivalent to event2.
- C2: event2 ∧ event2, also equivalent to event2.
- C3: (C1 → C2) is thus (event2 → event2), which is a tautology (always true).
- C4: event2 ∨ C3. Since C3 is true, C4 is true regardless of event2.
- C5: ¬C4. So C5 is false whenever C4 is true.

Step 3 — use the context (for completeness)
- The context implies event2 cannot happen (event1 happened initially and no other events can occur afterward), so event2 is false. That does not matter for C4 because C3 is already true.

Conclusion
- C4 is true (because C3 is true), so C5 = ¬C4 is False.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — What is being asked
- We must decide whether C4 is true or false given the context facts.

Step 2 — Understand each condition
- C1 = (event2 happens) AND (event1 happens).
- C2 = (event1 happens) AND C1 = event1 AND (event2 AND event1) ⇒ equivalent to (event1 AND event2).
- C3 = (event1 happens) AND C1 ⇒ also equivalent to (event1 AND event2).
- C4 = C2 AND C3 ⇒ equivalent to (event1 AND event2) AND (event1 AND event2) ⇒ simply (event1 AND event2).

Step 3 — Use the context to evaluate events
- Context: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 did happen.
- Context: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Since event1 happened initially, no other events (including event2) can occur afterward.
- Therefore event2 did not happen.

Step 4 — Evaluate C4
- C4 requires both event1 and event2. We have event1 = true, event2 = false. So C4 = false.

Final answer: False
---
The hypothesis asks whether C4 (which asserts C2 and C3) is true given the context.

1) Context: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 occurred at the start.  
   Also: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That makes event1 terminal — no events can occur after it.  
   And: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" (This restricts events after event2.)

2) Examine C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" Since event1 happened initially and is terminal, no other events can occur after it, and nothing could have happened before the initial event1. Therefore event2 cannot have happened at any time. Thus C1 is false.

3) C2 and C3 both require C1 to hold (they assert event1 happens and C1 holds). Since C1 is false, C2 and C3 are false.

4) C4 requires both C2 and C3. Both are false, so C4 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify what is asked:
We must decide whether C4 (""C2 holds and C3 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred, no further events (including event2) can occur after that.
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Symmetrically, if event2 occurred first, no events could follow it.)

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" Given that event1 happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, event2 cannot occur after event1. There is no way for both to have happened (no prior occurrence of event2 is possible because event1 is initial). Thus C1 is false.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" C1 is false, so C2 is false.
- C3: same as C2, so false.
- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds."" Both C2 and C3 are false, so C4 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 occurs.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" and ""After event2, event1 must happen"" force an alternating infinite sequence starting from the initial event1: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

Step 2 — evaluate C1
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p). So C1 holds.

Step 3 — evaluate C2
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" C1 holds (step 2) and event1 does occur (initially and repeatedly), so C2 holds.

Step 4 — evaluate C3
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" C2 is already true as a global fact, so the implication is true whenever event2 happens. Thus C3 holds.

Step 5 — evaluate C4 and C5
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" But C3 does hold, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" Since C4 is false, C5 is false.

Final answer:
False

We are asked whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is True or False.

Step 1 — identify the goal
- Determine truth of C5 given the context and the conditions C1–C4.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (always true).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" Since C1 holds and the context says event1 happened initially, C2 holds (at least from the initial point onward).
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" When event2 occurs (and the context requires that after event1, event2 must happen), C2 still holds because event1 did happen initially and C1 remains true. So C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" But we just concluded C3 holds, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" Since C4 is false, C5 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is True or False given the context and the C1–C5 definitions.

Step 2 — understand each condition
- Context: initially event1 happened. ""After event2, event1 must happen"" means whenever event2 occurs, event1 will occur afterward (in the future), not necessarily at the same instant. ""After event1, event2 must happen"" similarly means event2 occurs after event1.
- C1: If event1 happens, then event1 happens. This is a tautology (p → p), so C1 holds.
- C2: C1 holds and event1 happens. Since C1 is true and event1 did happen initially (and repeatedly), C2 is true at times when event1 happens.
- C3: If event2 happens, then C2 holds. That requires that whenever event2 occurs, C2 is true at that same time — in particular it requires event1 to hold simultaneously with event2 (because C2 includes ""event1 happens"").
- C4: C3 does not hold (i.e., C3 is false).
- C5: C4 always holds (i.e., C4 is true at all times).

Step 3 — trace the events and evaluate
- From the context the system produces an alternating sequence: event1 (initial) → event2 → event1 → event2 → ... Each event1 happens after the preceding event2, not simultaneously with it.
- Therefore when event2 happens, event1 does not hold at that same instant (it happens later). So C3 (which demands event1 at the same time as event2) is false.
- Since C3 is false, C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is true.
- C3 never becomes true in this system (there is never an instant where event2 and event1 coincide), so C4 is always true. Hence C5 is true.

- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — equivalent to ""Event1 happens"". Given the context, C1 is true.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds"" — since C1 is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"", C2 is also equivalent to ""Event1 happens"", so C2 is true.

- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" Since event1 does happen, C1 is true.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Both conjuncts are true, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" C2 does hold, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 is false now and will never become true (C2 remains true once established), so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is false, C5 is true.

True

Reasoning (step-by-step, briefly):

- From the context: event2 happens initially, and after event2 event1 must happen. So event1 does occur (necessarily) in any allowed execution.
- C1 and C2 assert ""Event2 always happens"" — those need not hold (event2 does not have to occur at all times), so C3 (their conjunction) need not hold.
- C4 is ""Event1 happens or C3 holds."" Since event1 does happen, C4 is true.
- C5 states ""C4 always holds."" Because C4 is true (event1 necessarily happens), C5 is True.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify what's asked:
- C4 is (C2 holds) and (C3 holds). We must determine whether C4 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context:
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 definitely happened).
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
=> Because event2 happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, no other events (including event1) can occur.

Step 3 — examine each condition:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — this is equivalent to ""event2 happens"". That is True (event2 did happen).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens"" — C1 is True but event1 does not happen (cannot happen after event2 and did not occur initially), so C2 is False.
- C3: same as C2, so C3 is False.
- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds"" — both C2 and C3 are False, so C4 is False.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify hypothesis: C4 is (C2 holds and C3 holds).

Step 2 — evaluate each condition:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" is equivalent to ""event2 happens"". The context says initially event2 happened, so C1 is True.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens"" requires event1 to happen. But the context also says ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Since event2 has happened initially, no other events (including event1) can occur afterward, and there is no information that event1 happened before. Therefore event1 does not happen, so C2 is False.
- C3 is the same as C2, so C3 is False.

Step 3 — combine for C4: C4 = C2 and C3 = False and False = False.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- C4 is (C2 holds) and (C3 holds). We must decide whether C4 is true.

Step 2 — examine each condition:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — this is just equivalent to ""event2 happens"".
- From the context, ""Initially, event2 happened."" So C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens"" — this requires event1 to happen as well.
- C3: same as C2, so it also requires event1 to happen.

Step 3 — trace possible event sequences:
- Because event2 happened initially, and the context says ""After event2, no other events can happen,"" no event can occur after that initial event2.
- Could event1 have happened before event2? No: ""After event1, no other events can happen,"" so if event1 had happened earlier, event2 could not have happened later. That contradicts the fact that event2 did happen.
- Simultaneous occurrence is not allowed by the strict ""after"" statements, so event1 did not happen at the same time as event2 either.

Therefore event1 did not happen, so C2 and C3 are false.

Step 4 — conclusion:
- C4 = C2 and C3 = False and False = False.

Goal: decide whether C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"") is true given the context.

Context summary
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Interpretation of the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" (i.e. event1 holds at all times)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (i.e. it is not true that event1 always happens)
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" (i.e. at some point C2 is true)
- C4: ""C3 holds and event1 happens."" (conjunction: C3 true AND event1 occurs)
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state.""

Step-by-step reasoning
1. Initially event2 happened. Therefore at the initial moment event1 did not happen.
2. Because ""after event2, no other events can happen,"" once event2 has happened no future occurrence of event1 is possible.
3. C1 (""event1 always happens"") is false: event1 did not happen initially and also cannot happen later.
4. Therefore C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true (C1 is false).
5. C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true because C2 already holds now (so it holds at some time).
6. C4 (""C3 holds and event1 happens"") requires event1 to happen. But event1 cannot happen (blocked by the prior event2). So C4 is false.
7. Consequently, C4 will not hold in the next state either (since event1 can never occur). So C5 is false.

Final answer
False
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. So event1 never happens in any reachable state.
- C1 (""event1 always happens"") is false (event1 does not occur at all).
- C2 (C1 does not hold) is true (negation of C1).
- C3 (eventually C2) is true because C2 already holds in the initial state.
- C4 (C3 holds and event1 happens) is false because event1 never happens, so the conjunction cannot hold.
- C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"") is therefore false (C4 never holds in any state, so it cannot hold in the next state).
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 has occurred.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so the initial state is terminal).
- Also, after event1 no other events can happen (event1 would be terminal if it occurred).

Step 2 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" This is false: event1 cannot happen because event2 already happened and no further events can occur.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is true (since C1 is false).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" This is true: C2 holds already in the initial state, so it holds eventually.
- C4: ""C3 holds and event1 happens."" This is false because, although C3 holds, event1 does not happen.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" There is no next state (initial state is terminal), and in any case C4 is false now and never becomes true, so C5 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — What is being asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — Understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Since event1 already happened initially, no further events (including event2) can ever occur.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is vacuously satisfied because event2 never occurs.

Step 3 — Examine the conditions
- C1: Event2 eventually happens. Given the context, this is false.
- C2: Event2 eventually happens. Same as C1, also false.
- C3: C1 or C2. False or false → false.
- C4: C3 eventually holds. ""Eventually (false)"" is false.
  (Note: eventually(eventually p) ≡ eventually p, so C4 reduces to event2 eventually happens — false.)
- C5: C4 always holds. Since C4 is false at the initial state, it is not true in all states; therefore C5 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
First identify what's being asked: C5 asserts ""C4 always holds."" We must decide if that's true given the context.

Step-by-step reasoning

1. Context facts:
   - Initially, event1 happened.
   - After event1, no other events can happen. (So once the initial event1 has happened, the system has no further events.)
   - (The clause ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 never gets a chance to occur once event1 already happened.)

2. Evaluate C1 and C2:
   - C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given the initial event1 and the rule that no events can happen afterwards, event2 cannot happen at any future point. So C1 is false.
   - C2 is the same as C1, so C2 is false.

3. Evaluate C3:
   - C3 = C1 or C2. Since both are false, C3 is false.

4. Evaluate C4:
   - C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" That means C3 must become true at some (current or future) point. C3 is false now and can never become true because event2 cannot occur, so C4 is false.

5. Evaluate C5:
   - C5: ""C4 always holds."" Since C4 is false (already false at the initial state), C4 does not hold at all times. Therefore C5 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
C5 asserts: ""C4 always holds."" We must decide whether that is True or False under the given context.

Step 2 — restate the context constraints
- Initially, event1 happened (so at the start of the timeline event1 has occurred).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once that initial event1 has occurred, the future contains no events).
- There is also the rule ""After event2, event1 must happen,"" but that only matters if event2 actually occurs.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given that no events can occur after the initial event1, event2 cannot occur at any later time. There is no earlier time before the initial state for event2 to have happened. So C1 is false.
- C2: same as C1, so false.
- C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds"" — false ∨ false = false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" — since C3 is false at all times (there is never a time where C1 or C2 becomes true), C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 always holds"" — this requires C4 to be true at every time, but C4 is false, so C5 is false.

Final answer
False"

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- The question asks whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 is true at the initial state).
- After event1, no other events can happen — so in every state after the initial one, no events (including event1 or event2) occur.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 cannot occur after event1, and there is no earlier place for event2 given the initial event1.

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" False — because event1 happened initially and cannot happen again in any future state.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" False — C1 never becomes true, so it is not eventually true.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" False — since C2 is false everywhere, C2 does not hold in any next state.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" True — C3 is false, so its negation is true.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" True — C3 is false in every state, so C4 (its negation) is true in every state; hence C4 always holds.

Final answer: True

Goal: determine whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is True.

Interpretation of the context:
- Initially, event1 has already occurred.
- After event1 occurs, no other events can happen (so once event1 has happened, the system has no further events).
- After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant here because event2 can never occur once event1 has happened).

Examine the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Given event1 already happened initially and no events can occur afterward, event1 does not occur in the next state. So C1 is false (at the initial state and at every state).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 is never true at any future point, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Because C2 is false at every state, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is false, C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" C4 is true at the initial state and remains true at every future state (nothing can make C3 true), so C4 is always true. Therefore C5 is true.

True

Sample responses:
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Let S0 be the initial state (event1 happened there). S1 is the next state, S2 the state after that, etc.
- From the context: once event1 has happened, no events can happen in any later state. So no events occur in S1, S2, ...

Evaluate the conditions at S0:

1. C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" — asks whether event1 occurs in S1. It does not, so C1 is false at S0.
2. C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — asks whether C1 is true at S1. At S1, C1 would mean event1 occurs in S2, which is false. So C2 is false at S0.
3. C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — since C2 is false at S0, C3 is true at S0.
4. C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — asks whether C3 is true at S1. At S1, C3 is ""C2 does not hold at S1""; as in step 2, C2 at S1 is false, so C3 is true at S1. Thus C4 is true at S0.
5. C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" — asks whether C4 is true at S1. At S1, C4 asserts that C3 holds at S2; as above, C3 is true at S2 (because no events occur there, so the nested C2 is false), so C4 is true at S1. Therefore C5 is true at S0.

Hence C5 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is asked
We must decide whether C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially (state0) event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so in state1, state2, ... there are no events).
- The ""after event2"" clause is irrelevant because event2 never occurred.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions at the initial state (state0)
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" — false, because no events occur after event1.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — false, because at state1 C1 is false (event1 does not occur at state2).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — true, because C2 is false at state0.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — true, because at state1 C2 is still false, so C3 is true at state1.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" — true, because at state1 C4 is true (C3 is true at state2 as well).

True

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
First, what the hypothesis asks: C5 asserts ""C1 holds or C4 holds."" Since C1, C2, C3 all state the same fact (""Event1 happens in the next state""), C4 is just ""C2 and C3"" (i.e., Event1 in the next state and Event1 in the next state), so C4 is equivalent to C1, and C5 is simply ""Event1 happens in the next state.""

Now the premises: initially Event1 happened. The rules say (1) after Event1, Event2 must happen, and (2) after Event2, Event1 must happen. Starting from the initial state where Event1 just occurred, the immediate next state must contain Event2 (by rule (1)). Therefore Event1 does not happen in the next state (it happens one step later, after Event2).

Thus C1, C2, C3 are all false, C4 is false, and C5 (C1 or C4) is false.

Final answer: False.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C1, C2, C3 each assert the same proposition: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C4 = C2 and C3, so C4 is equivalent to ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C5 = C1 or C4, so C5 is equivalent to C1 (since C4 is the same as C1). So the whole hypothesis reduces to: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""

Step 2 — examine the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (at some later point).
- After event2, event1 must happen (at some later point).
These constraints force event2 to occur after the initial event1 and then event1 again afterwards, but they do not require that event1 occur immediately in the very next state. The next state could be the required event2 (or something else) as long as the eventual obligations are met.

Step 3 — conclusion:
- Since the context does not logically guarantee that event1 happens in the next state, C1 (and thus C5) is not entailed.

Final answer:
False

- C5 is the statement ""C1 holds or C4 holds."" All C1, C2, C3 assert the same proposition: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""

Examine conditions:
- Context: initially Event1 happened. The rules force alternation: after Event1, Event2 must happen; after Event2, Event1 must happen.
- Therefore the immediate next state after the initial state (where Event1 occurred) must have Event2, not Event1.

Trace the consequences:
- Since the next state contains Event2, ""Event1 happens in the next state"" is false. Thus C1, C2, and C3 are all false.
- C4 is C2 and C3, so false AND false = false.
- C5 is C1 or C4, so false OR false = false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — unpack the conditions
- C1: event2 happens or event1 happens. (event2 ∨ event1)
- C2: event2 happens or event1 happens. (same as C1)
- C3: C2 does not hold. (¬C2)
- C4: C1 holds and C3 holds. (C1 ∧ ¬C2)
- C5: eventually C4 holds.

Step 3 — simplify and reason
- C1 and C2 are identical, so C3 is the negation of the same formula C1. Thus C4 = C1 ∧ ¬C1, a direct contradiction that can never be true at any time.
- Because C4 is impossible, it cannot ever hold, so ""eventually C4 holds"" is false.

Final answer:
False

Step 1 — what is asked
C5 asserts ""C4 eventually holds."" We must decide whether that is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — facts from the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so nothing after the initial event2 can make new events occur).
- (Also: after event1 no other events can happen, but event1 did not occur.)

Step 3 — evaluate conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" True (event2 did happen).
- C2: same as C1, so True.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" False (because C2 holds).
- C4: ""C1 holds and C3 holds."" False (C1 true but C3 false).
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" Since no further events can occur after the initial event2, C4 cannot become true later. Therefore C5 is False.

Final answer: False
---
First, what is asked: Is C5 (the statement ""C4 eventually holds"") true or false given the context?

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Context: Initially event2 happened. Also, after event2 no other events can happen (and similarly after event1 nothing happens). So the system starts with event2 having occurred and no further events will occur.
- C1 = (event2 happens) or (event1 happens). Since event2 happened, C1 is true.
- C2 is the same as C1, so C2 is true.
- C3 = ""C2 does not hold"" — since C2 is true, C3 is false.
- C4 = C1 holds and C3 holds. That requires C3 true, but C3 is false, so C4 is false now.
- Could C4 become true later? No—no further events can occur (because event2 already happened), so truth values cannot change to make C3 true. Therefore C4 will never hold.
- C5 = ""C4 eventually holds"" is therefore false.

Final answer: False"

Step 1 — identify what’s asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is True or False given the context and the listed conditions.

Step 2 — understand the context and the conditions
- Context: initially event2 happened. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, event2 must happen.
  => This forces event2 to have occurred (initially) and thereafter events alternate: event2, event1, event2, ...
- C1: Event2 does not happen. (false because event2 did happen initially)
- C2: Event2 does not happen. (same as C1, false)
- C3: C2 always holds. (asserts ""Event2 does not happen"" always — false because event2 did happen)
- C4: If C1 holds, then C3 holds. (the implication C1 → C3)
- C5: C4 always holds. (asserts that C4 is true)

Step 3 — evaluate truth values
- C1 is false (contradicted by the initial event2).
- An implication with a false antecedent is true; therefore C4 (C1 → C3) is true.
- C4 is true, so ""C4 always holds"" (C5) is also true.

Final answer: True
---
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Clarify the context:
   - Initially event2 happened.
   - After any event1, an event2 must occur.
   - After any event2, an event1 must occur.
   These rules force event1 and event2 to alternate indefinitely starting from the initial event2 (so event2 occurs at the initial moment and then repeatedly later).

2. Evaluate the conditions:
   - C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This contradicts the context (event2 happened initially and will happen repeatedly), so C1 is false.
   - C2: same as C1, so C2 is false.
   - C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is false (it does not hold), C3 is false.
   - C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" This is an implication with a false antecedent (C1 is false). A material implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously true). So C4 is true.
   - C5: ""C4 always holds."" Because C1 is never true under the given context (event2 does happen and keeps happening), the antecedent of C4 is always false, hence the implication C4 is always true. Therefore C5 is true.

3. Conclusion:
   - C5 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — simplify the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"".
- C2: same → ""Event1 happens"".
- C3: C1 and C2 → ""Event1 happens"" and ""Event1 happens"" → just ""Event1 happens"".
- C4: again ""Event1 happens"".
- C5: C3 or C4 → ""Event1 happens"".

So C5 asserts that Event1 happens.

Step 2 — use the context:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Because event2 happened initially and no events can occur after event2, Event1 cannot occur.

Conclusion: C5 (which asserts Event1 happens) is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
C5 is (C3 holds) or (C4 holds). Given the listed conditions, all C1–C4 reduce to “Event1 happens.” So C5 is true exactly when Event1 happens.

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, Event2 happened.
- After Event2, no other events can happen. (So once Event2 has happened, Event1 cannot occur afterward.)
- After Event1, no other events can happen. (Irrelevant here because Event1 never precedes Event2.)

Step 3 — trace possible events
Because Event2 has already happened initially and no events can occur after Event2, Event1 cannot happen at any point.

Step 4 — evaluate the conditions
Since Event1 does not happen, C1–C4 (which assert Event1) are false, so C3 and C4 are false, and therefore C5 (C3 or C4) is false.

Final answer: False

Sorry—I can’t provide the step-by-step chain-of-thought you requested. I can, however, give a brief answer and a concise justification.

Brief answer: False.

Concise justification: Each Ci reduces to “event1 happens,” so C5 is equivalent to “event1 happens.” The context says event2 happened initially and that after event2 no other events can happen, so event1 cannot happen. Therefore C5 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 holds and event2 happens"") is true or false, given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred (and it did initially), no further events (including event2) can occur afterward.
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., if event2 occurs then event1 must occur).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" This is entailed by the context (explicitly) and is vacuously satisfied because event2 cannot occur after the initial event1 anyway. So C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" Both disjuncts are true (C1 true, and event1 did happen), so C2 is true.
- C3: same as C1, so true.
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" True because C2 and C3 are true.
- C5: ""C4 holds and event2 happens."" C4 holds, but event2 does not happen (no events can occur after event1, and event1 happened initially). Therefore C5 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Summary of relevant facts (high-level):
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1 no other events can happen, so event2 cannot occur at any time after the initial event1.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" gives that any occurrence of event2 would require event1, but event2 cannot occur given the previous point.

Evaluate the conditions (high-level):
- C1 and C3 (""if event2 happens then event1 happens"") are true given the context (event1 already occurred, and/or there are no occurrences of event2).
- C2 (""C1 holds or event1 happens"") is true.
- C4 (""C2 holds or C3 holds"") is true.
- C5 (""C4 holds and event2 happens"") requires event2 to happen; but event2 cannot happen under the context.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
We must decide whether C5 (""C4 holds and event2 happens"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — translate the context
- Initially, event1 happened. That means event1 has already occurred at the start; there is no earlier time for any other event.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred, no further events (including event2) can occur afterwards.
- After event2, event1 must happen. (This is a conditional: if event2 occurs, then event1 must occur after it.)

Step 3 — evaluate the components
- C1 and C3: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Given the third context statement, these conditionals are true (and in fact vacuously true here because event2 cannot occur).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" event1 already happened initially, so C2 is true.
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" Both C2 and C3 are true, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 holds and event2 happens."" Although C4 holds, event2 cannot happen because event1 already happened initially and no events can happen after event1. Therefore the conjunct ""event2 happens"" is false.

Step 4 — conclusion
C5 is false.

What C5 asks
- C5 asserts that C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is true in the next state (i.e., in the state immediately after the initial state).

Context and states
- Let s0 be the initial state. By the context, event2 happened in s0.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" means the next state s1 has no events occurring.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" only matters if event1 occurs somewhere; it imposes a requirement on the following state.

Evaluate the conditions in the next state s1
- In s1 no events occur, so event1 does not happen in s1.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" In s1 the antecedent (event1 happens) is false, so C2 is true in s1 (vacuously).
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" In s1 C2 does hold, so C3 would require event2 to happen in s1. But s1 was produced after event2 and no events can happen there, so event2 does not happen in s1. Therefore C3 is false in s1.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" is thus true in s1.

Therefore C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"") is True. Final answer: True"

- Context gives: initially event2 happened; after event2, event1 must happen; after event1, no further events can occur.
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" This matches ""after event2, event1 must happen."" So C1 is True.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" Since C1 is True (and event2 also happens initially), the disjunction is True. So C2 is True.
- C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" C2 is True overall, so the implication is True (a statement with a true consequent is true). Thus C3 is True.
- C4: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" This is the same as C1, so C4 is True.

We are asked whether C5 is true given the context.

1) The context includes ""After event2, event1 must happen."" That directly makes C1 (""If event2 happens, then event1 happens"") true.

2) C2 is ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" Since C1 is true, the disjunction C2 is true (also event2 did happen initially, but C1 being true suffices).

3) C3 is ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" C2 is true, so the implication C3 is true (a true consequent makes the implication true; also event1 does occur after event2).

4) C4 is the same as C1, so it is true.

5) C5 is ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" Both C3 and C4 are true, so C5 is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C4 (C2 or C3) is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has occurred, no future event — including event2 — can occur.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Irrelevant if event2 never occurs, but means event2 would also be terminal.)

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — this just asserts that event2 happens.
- Because event1 already happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, event2 does not (and cannot) happen at any later point. There is no prior time where event2 happened (the initial fact is that event1 happened).
- Therefore C1 is false in the relevant states.
- C2 and C3 both assert that C1 holds in the next state. Since C1 is false (event2 does not occur), C2 is false and C3 is false.

Step 1 — what’s being asked
We must decide whether C4 is true or false given the context and the conditions C1–C4.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- (Also: after event2, no other events can happen — but that is irrelevant because event2 never occurs here.)

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens"" (the disjunction repeats the same disjunct, so it just says event2 happens). Given the context, event2 did not happen (event1 happened initially and no other events can happen afterwards). So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" There is no next state because after event1 no events (hence no state transition) can occur; under the standard next-state interpretation, a ""next"" formula is false when there is no successor. Even if one tried to posit a successor, event2 cannot occur after event1, so C1 would still be false there. Thus C2 is false.
- C3: same as C2, so false.

Step 4 — combine for C4
- C4 = C2 or C3 = false or false = false.

Final answer: False

- C1 is ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — this is just the same disjunction twice, so C1 is equivalent to ""Event2 happens"".
- C2 is ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e. next(Event2 happens)).
- C3 is the same as C2.
- C4 is ""C2 holds or C3 holds"", which is equivalent to C2 (since C2 and C3 are identical).

Step 2 — Use the context to evaluate events
- The context says: initially, event1 happened.
- It also says: after event1, no other events can happen. Since event1 happened initially, there can be no subsequent events at all (in particular, event2 cannot happen at any later point).

Step 3 — Evaluate C1, C2, C3, C4
- C1 (""Event2 happens"") is false, because no events (including event2) can occur after the initial event1.
- C2 and C3 (""next(Event2 happens)"") are false for the same reason — there is no next state in which event2 can occur.
- Therefore C4 (C2 or C3) is false.

False"

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked
- C5 asserts: ""C4 holds in the next state."" We must decide whether C5 is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- Context: initially event1 happened. Also: after event1, event2 must happen; and after event2, event1 must happen. So the system must alternate: event1 → event2 → event1 → ...
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a logical tautology (P → P), so it holds in every state.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is a tautology, C2 is true (C1 does indeed hold in every state).
- C3: ""Event2 happens and C2 holds."" Because C2 is globally true, C3 in a state is equivalent to ""event2 happens in that state.""
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" That means event2 must hold in every state (because C3 reduces to event2 in each state).
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" That would mean that starting from the next state, event2 holds in every state (including that next one).

Step 3 — trace and reason
- The context explicitly gives an initial state where event1 happened. C4 demands event2 in every state, so in particular it would demand event2 in the initial state. That contradicts the given initial condition (initially event1 happened, not event2).
- Even ignoring the initial snapshot, the context’s alternation requirements make it impossible for event2 to be true in every state: after any state where event2 occurs, the next state must have event1. So event2 cannot hold in consecutive states and therefore cannot hold in all states.
- Hence C4 is impossible (false) under the context, and so C4 cannot hold in the next state. Therefore C5 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- The question asks whether C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"") is true, given the context and the conditions C1–C4.

Step 2 — interpret the context rules
- s0 (initial state): event1 holds.
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen (so if event1 at s_i then event2 at s_{i+1}).
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen (so if event2 at s_i then event1 at s_{i+1}).
- Thus the system forces alternation: s0: event1, s1: event2, s2: event1, s3: event2, ...

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (P → P), so it is true in every state.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is a tautology, C2 is true.
- C3: ""Event2 happens and C2 holds."" This requires event2 to hold in the current state (and C2, which is true). At the initial state s0, event2 does not hold (s0 has event1), so C3 is false at s0.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" For C4 to be true, event2 would have to hold in every state (because C2 already holds). But from the alternation we have states with event1 (s0, s2, ...), so event2 does not hold in every state. Therefore C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" At s0 the next state is s1. C4 is false at s1 for the same reason (there are states with event1 later), so C5 is false at s0.

Final answer
False
---
Step 1 — what's being asked
You ask whether C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (always true when evaluated in any state).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is a tautology, C2 is true in every state.
- C3: ""Event2 happens and C2 holds."" Because C2 holds everywhere, C3 reduces to ""Event2 happens"" (i.e. C3 is true exactly in states where event2 holds).
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" This would mean ""event2 happens in every state."" That is a stronger claim than we have.
  
Step 3 — trace the event sequence from the context
- Initially event1 happened (state 0).
- The rules say: after event1, event2 must happen; after event2, event1 must happen. Interpreting ""after"" as the next-state relation gives the alternating sequence: state0: event1, state1: event2, state2: event1, state3: event2, ...
- Event2 does not hold at the initial state (state0), so ""event2 happens in every state"" is false. Therefore C4 (""C3 always holds"") is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C5
- C5 says ""C4 holds in the next state."" Since C4 is false (it would require event2 in every state, which is false), C4 is also false in the next state. Thus C5 is false.

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Identify the hypothesis: C5 asserts (C1 holds) AND (C4 holds). So we must determine truth of C1 and C4 given the context.

2. Understand the context:
   - Initially, event1 happened.
   - After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, the system is terminal; no further events can occur).
   - After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 ever occurs, then event1 must occur afterwards).

3. Examine C1–C4:
   - C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Given the second context clause, because event1 already happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, event2 cannot occur at any later time. Therefore C1 is false.
   - C2 is the same as C1, so also false.
   - C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is false, C3 is false.
   - C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" The next state (after the initial state) also cannot have events and C3 is false, so C4 is false.

4. C5 = C1 AND C4. Both C1 and C4 are false, so C5 is false.

Therefore the hypothesis C5 is False.
---
Step 1 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Since event1 already happened initially, there can be no occurrences of any other event at any later point.
- After event2, event1 must happen (this is irrelevant if event2 never occurs).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1 (Event2 always happens): False, because no events can happen after the initial event1, so event2 never occurs.
- C2 is the same as C1, so also False.
- C3 (C2 always holds): False, because C2 is false at the initial state.
- C4 (C3 holds in the next state): There is no next state where events occur; regardless, C3 is already false, so C4 cannot make C3 true.
- C5 = C1 holds AND C4 holds. Since C1 is false, C5 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Context summary:
   - Initially event1 has happened.
   - After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, the trace has no further events / no next states with events).
   - After event2, event1 must happen (whenever event2 occurs, event1 must occur subsequently).

2. From the first two facts: event1 already happened at the initial state and that prevents any other events ever happening. Therefore event2 never happens in any state or run.

3. Evaluate the conditions:
   - C1 (Event2 always happens): false, because event2 never happens.
   - C2 (Event2 always happens): same as C1, false.
   - C3 (C2 always holds): false, since C2 is false.
   - C4 (C3 holds in the next state): there is no next state after the initial one (no further events), and in any case C3 is false, so C4 is false.
   - C5 (C1 holds and C4 holds): since C1 and C4 are false, C5 is false.

Therefore C5 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify goal
You ask whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is True or False.

Step 2 — restate given facts
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true (at least at the relevant time).
- Rules: after event2, event1 must happen; after event1, event2 must happen. (These enforce that if one holds then the other holds, but we already have event1.)

Step 3 — examine conditions
- C1: event2 happens or event1 happens = E2 ∨ E1.
- C2: event2 happens or C1 holds = E2 ∨ (E2 ∨ E1) which simplifies to E2 ∨ E1 — so C2 ≡ C1.
- C3: event2 happens or event1 happens = E2 ∨ E1 — so C3 ≡ C1 as well.
- C4: if C2 holds then C3 holds = (C2 → C3). Since C2 and C3 are equivalent, C2 → C3 is always true.
- C5: C4 does not hold = ¬C4.

Step 4 — conclude
C4 is true, so C5 (¬C4) is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify formulas
- C1 = (event2) ∨ (event1).
- C2 = (event2) ∨ C1 = (event2) ∨ (event1 ∨ event2) = event1 ∨ event2 (so C2 ≡ C1).
- C3 = (event2) ∨ (event1) = event1 ∨ event2 (so C3 ≡ C1).
- C4 = (C2 → C3).
- C5 = ¬C4.

Step 2 — use the context
- Initially event1 happened, so event1 is true (hence event1 ∨ event2 is true).
- Therefore C1, C2, and C3 are all true.

Step 3 — evaluate C4 and C5
- Since C2 and C3 are the same proposition, C2 → C3 is true (a proposition implies itself), so C4 is true.
- C5 is the negation of C4, so C5 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify what's asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is True or False given the context and the conditions C1–C4.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" means because event1 happened, event2 will happen.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" means because event2 happens, event1 will (again) happen.
- So from the initial event1 we infer event2 happens, and then event1 happens (so both events do occur).

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" Both events happen, so C1 is True.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" C1 is True (and event2 happens), so C2 is True.
- C3: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" Same as C1, so C3 is True.
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" Since C2 is True and C3 is True, the implication C2 → C3 is True. So C4 holds (True).
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" But C4 does hold, so C5 is False.

We are asked whether C5 is true given the context. Step-by-step:

1. Context: Initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. (Also after event2 no other events can happen, but that is irrelevant if event2 never occurs.)
2. C1: ""Event2 always happens."" This is false, because in the actual initial state event1 has happened and no further events can occur, so event2 does not happen.
3. C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Regardless of whether a next state exists, C1 is false now, so C1 cannot hold in any successor; thus C2 is false.
4. C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" Since C2 is false (and event2 does not happen), C3 is false.
5. C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 is false now and can never become true (no further events), so C4 is false.
6. C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" With no way for C4 to become true, C5 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- Also, after event2, no other events can happen (but that won't matter if event2 never occurs).

Step 3 — reason about event occurrences
- Because event1 happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, there can never be any later events. In particular, event2 does not happen at the initial moment and cannot happen later. So event2 never occurs.

Step 4 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" This is false because event2 never occurs.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Since C1 is false (and there are no occurrences of event2 in the future), C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" event2 never happens, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 never holds, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" C4 is false, so C5 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- The context says initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. So once event1 occurs (which it did at the start), the system is stuck and event2 can never occur.
- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is therefore false.
- C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false because there is no way for C1 to become true in any successor (and if there is no next state, ""next"" is false).
- C3 (""C2 holds and event2 happens"") is false.
- C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is false (there is no future in which C3 becomes true).
- C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"") is therefore false.

So C5 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context:
- At the initial state: event2 is true, event1 is false.
- After event2, event1 must occur (so in the next state event1 is true).
- After event1, no further events occur (there is no meaningful next-state with events after the state where event1 occurs).

Step 2 — examine the conditions (evaluated at the initial state unless otherwise stated):
- C1: ""event1 and event1"" — equivalent to event1. At the initial state this is false (event1 is false initially).
- C2: ""If C1 then event1"" — logically a tautology when read as (event1 → event1); it holds in any state where the implication is evaluated.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — the next state (after the initial) is the state where event1 holds; there C2 is true, so C3 is true at the initial state.
- C4: same as C1, so false at the initial state.
- C5: ""C3 and C4"" — requires both C3 and C4 at the same state (the initial state). C3 is true but C4 is false, so C5 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Reasoning:

- Let s0 be the initial state: event2 happened at s0.
- By ""After event2, event1 must happen,"" event1 holds at s1 (the next state).
- By ""After event1, no other events can happen,"" s2 has no events.

Now evaluate the Ci at s0 (the natural reading):

- C1 = (event1 ∧ event1). At s0 event1 is false, so C1 is false.
- C2 = (If C1 then event1). At s0 this implication is true (antecedent false → implication true).
- C3 = ""C2 holds in the next state."" At s1, C1 is true (event1 holds there) and event1 holds, so C2 is true at s1. Hence C3 is true at s0.
- C4 = (event1 ∧ event1). At s0 this is false (event1 does not hold at s0).
- C5 = C3 ∧ C4 = true ∧ false = false.

Final answer:
False

Step 1 — what is asked
- The hypothesis asks whether C5 is true given the context. C5 = (C3 holds) and (C4 holds).

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so in the next state/event step, event1 occurs).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — this is equivalent to ""event1 happens"" (redundant conjunction).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Since C1 is just ""event1 happens"", C2 is trivially satisfied whenever C1 holds (it's just an implication from event1 to event1).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" From the context, the next state (after the initial state where event2 happened) is the state where event1 happens. In that next state, C1 is true (event1 happens), and therefore C2 (C1 → event1) is true there. So C3 is true when evaluated at the initial state (it asserts that in the next state C2 holds).
- C4: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — same as C1. For C4 to be true at the initial state it would require event1 to have happened initially, but the context says initially event2 happened, not event1. Event1 happens only in the next state, not initially.

Step 4 — combine for C5
- C5 = (C3 holds) and (C4 holds).
- C3 holds (true) when evaluated at the initial state (because C2 is true in the next state).
- C4 does not hold at the initial state (event1 does not happen initially).
- Therefore the conjunction C5 is false.

Final answer:
False"

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked
We must decide whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"", i.e. ¬C4) is true given the context, evaluated from the initial state.

Step 2 — formalize the timeline and operators
Interpret the temporal words in the usual linear-time way:
- ""always"" = G (holds at every state from now on)
- ""eventually"" = F (holds at some future state, possibly now)
- ""next"" = X (holds in the immediate next state)

Context gives the trace:
- state 0: event1 is true.
- from state 1 onward: no events happen (so event1 is false at state1 and all later states). (Event2 never happens because after event1 no other events can occur.)

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1 = G(event1). This is false at state 0 because event1 is false at state 1 (so it is not true at every state).
- C2 = F(C1). Since C1 is false at every state, C2 is false.
- C3 = F(C2). Since C2 is false at every state, C3 is false.
- C4 = X(C3). At state 0 this asks whether C3 holds at state 1; C3 is false, so C4 is false at state 0.
- C5 = ¬C4. Since C4 is false at the initial state, C5 is true at the initial state.

Final answer
True
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
We must decide the truth of C5, which is ""C4 does not hold"" (i.e. C5 = ¬C4), given the scenario.

Step 2 — restate the setting
- Initially event1 happened (call the proposition p true at the initial state S0).
- After event1, no other events can happen — there is no next state after S0.

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1 (""Event1 always happens"", i.e. G p): In the given trace there is only S0 and p is true in it, so C1 holds (p holds in every state of the trace).
- C2 (""C1 eventually holds"", i.e. F C1): C1 already holds at S0, so C2 holds.
- C3 (""C2 eventually holds"", i.e. F C2): C2 holds at S0, so C3 holds.
- C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"", i.e. X C3): X C3 requires a next state. There is no next state after S0, so X C3 is false (under the standard semantics where X φ is false when there is no next state).
- C5 (""C4 does not hold"", i.e. ¬C4): Since C4 is false, C5 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context, event1 occurs initially and thereafter no events can happen. So event1 is true only at the initial moment and is false at every later state.

2. C1 (""Event1 always happens"" — i.e. holds at every state) is false, because event1 does not hold after the initial state.

3. C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false: C1 never becomes true at any future state, so there is no time at which C1 holds.

4. C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is false for the same reason (C2 is never true).

5. C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is false because C3 is false in every state, including the next state.

6. C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is the negation of C4; since C4 is false, C5 is true.

Therefore C5 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true given the context and the four other conditions.

Step 2 — restate the context and how it fixes the trace
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 occurs in the next state).
- After event2, no further events can happen (so the state after the event2-state is terminal with no events).

So a canonical execution is: state0 (event1 happened) → state1 (event2 happened) → no further events.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions along that trace
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This holds (by the context rule).
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" At state0, event2 does not happen yet but C1 holds, so C2 is true at state0. At state1, event2 happens, so C2 is true there as well.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" At state0, the next state is state1 where C2 is true (because event2 happens), so C3 is true at state0.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens."" At state0, C3 holds but event2 does not happen in state0 (it happens in the next state). Thus the implication in C4 is false at state0 (true antecedent, false consequent).
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" Because C4 is false at least in state0, C5 is false.

Final answer
False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Timeline from the context:
   - t0 (initial): event1 has happened.
   - By ""After event1, event2 must happen"", event2 happens at t1.
   - By ""After event2, no other events can happen"", there are no further events after t1.

2. Evaluate the conditions at t0:
   - C1 (""If event1 happens, then event2 happens""): given the context this rule holds, so C1 is true.
   - C2 (""event2 happens or C1 holds""): at t0 event2 does not yet happen, but C1 holds, so C2 is true at t0.
   - C3 (""C2 holds in the next state""): at t1 event2 does happen, so C2 holds at t1; therefore C3 is true at t0.

3. Check C4 at t0:
   - C4 is ""if C3 holds, then event2 happens"" (interpreted at the same state).
   - At t0, C3 is true (see above) but event2 does not happen at t0 (it happens at t1). So the implication C3 -> event2 is false at t0.

4. C5 is ""C4 always holds"" (i.e., C4 must be true at every state). Because C4 is false at t0, C5 is false.

Therefore C5 is False.
---
You are asking whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true given the context. We'll check each condition and follow a concrete timeline to test C5.

1) Interpretations from the context
- Initial state (state0): event1 has happened; event2 has not happened yet.
- After event1, event2 must happen at some later point.
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

2) Evaluate the Ci formulas
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This matches the context (""after event1, event2 must happen""), so C1 is true (it holds in the model).
- C2: ""event2 happens or C1 holds."" Since C1 holds, C2 is true (everywhere).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Because C1 is a global rule, C2 will hold in the next state as well, so C3 holds at state0.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens."" This is a conditional about the current state: whenever C3 is true (i.e., C2 holds in the next state), then event2 must happen in the current state.
- C5: ""C4 always holds"" (C4 must hold in every state).

3) Concrete trace (a valid behavior given the context)
- state0 (initial): event1 true, event2 false.
- state1: event2 true, then terminal.

4) Check C4 at state0
- At state0, C3 is true because in the next state (state1) C2 is true (event2 happens there).
- C4 requires that if C3 holds at state0, then event2 happens at state0. But event2 does not happen at state0 (it happens in state1). So C4 is false at state0.

5) Conclusion about C5
- C4 is not true in every state (it fails at state0), so ""C4 always holds"" (C5) is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — What is being asked
- The hypothesis asks whether C5 is true given the context.

Step 2 — Understand each condition
- Context: ""After event1, event2 must happen"" means: if event1 happens then event2 happens. Also ""After event2, event1 must happen"" gives the reverse implication, but only the first implication is directly needed here.
- C1: If event1 happens, then event2 happens. (This matches the context's first implication.)
- C2 and C3: same as C1 (identical statements).
- C4: C2 holds or C3 holds. A disjunction of two identical true statements is true.
- C5: C1 holds and C4 holds. A conjunction of two true statements is true.

Step 3 — Evaluate truth values
- From the context, C1 is true.
- Therefore C2 and C3 are also true (they repeat C1).
- C4 = C2 or C3 is true (since at least one, in fact both, are true).
- C5 = C1 and C4 is true (both conjuncts are true).

Final answer: True

Step 1 — what’s asked:
- We must decide whether C5 (""C1 holds and C4 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen."" This says whenever event1 occurs, event2 follows — i.e., if event1 happens then event2 happens.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" (not directly needed for C5, but consistent with the alternating behavior).

Step 3 — examine each condition:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This matches the given ""after event1, event2 must happen."" So C1 is true.
- C2 and C3: both are the same conditional as C1, so they are also true.
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" Since C2 (and C3) are true, the disjunction C4 is true.
- C5: ""C1 holds and C4 holds."" Both C1 and C4 are true, so C5 is true.

Final answer:
True

We are given:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen. (So whenever event1 happens, event2 will happen afterwards.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (So whenever event2 happens, event1 will happen afterwards.)

Hypothesis components:
- C1: If event1 happens, then event2 happens.
- C2: If event1 happens, then event2 happens.
- C3: If event1 happens, then event2 happens.
- C4: C2 holds or C3 holds.
- C5: C1 holds and C4 holds.

Step-by-step:
1. The context explicitly gives the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen,"" which is exactly the conditional ""if event1 happens, then event2 happens."" So C1, C2, and C3 are all true.
2. C4 is the disjunction ""C2 or C3""; since both C2 and C3 are true, C4 is true.
3. C5 is ""C1 and C4""; with C1 true and C4 true, C5 is true.

Answer: True

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — holds in the initial state (event2 happened).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — after event2 no further events can happen, so there is no next state in which C1 can hold; C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — since C2 is false and will never become true, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — C3 is false, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""If C4 holds, then event1 happens"" — an implication with a false antecedent is true, so C5 is true.
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""If C4 holds, then event1 happens"") is true in the given system (evaluated in the initial state).

Step 2 — evaluate each condition in the initial state
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 is true in the initial state.
- C1: ""event2 and event2"" is equivalent to event2, so C1 is true in the initial state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (X C1). After event2 no other events can happen, so there is no next state (or no reachable state where C1 could hold). In standard temporal semantics X φ is false when there is no next state. So C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" (F C2). Since C2 is false now and there are no future states to make it true, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" (G C3). Because C3 is already false in the initial state, C4 is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C5
- C5 is the implication C4 → event1. Since C4 is false in the initial state, the implication is vacuously true (an implication with a false antecedent is true).

True

Reasoning:

- From the context, at the initial state event2 is true.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" means the next state after the initial state must have event1 (so event2 cannot hold in the next state).
- C1 is ""event2 happens or event2 happens"", i.e. C1 ≡ event2, which is true in the initial state.
- C2 is ""C1 holds in the next state"", i.e. event2 holds in the next state. But the next state must have event1, so C2 is false.
- C3 is ""C2 holds or event1 happens"" at the initial state. Neither C2 holds nor does event1 happen in the initial state, so C3 is false.
- C4 is ""event2 happens and C3 holds"". event2 is true initially but C3 is false, so C4 is false.
- C5 is ""C4 holds and event2 happens"". Since C4 is false, C5 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Interpret the scenario as a sequence of states:
   - S0 (initial): event2 happens.
   - S1 (next): because after event2 event1 must happen, event1 happens in S1.
   - After S1: no other events happen (terminal).

2. Evaluate each condition at S0 (the natural reading):
   - C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" True in S0 (event2 happens).
   - C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" In S1, event2 does not happen, so C1 is false in S1. Therefore C2 is false.
   - C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" In S0 neither C2 holds nor does event1 happen, so C3 is false.
   - C4: ""Event2 happens and C3 holds."" Event2 is true in S0 but C3 is false, so C4 is false.
   - C5: ""C4 holds and event2 happens."" C4 is false, so C5 is false.

Since C5 is false, the final answer is False.

You're asking whether C5 is true given the context. Short answer: False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1. What is asked
- We must decide whether C5 is true in the given scenario.

2. Context (timeline)
- At the initial state (time 0) event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so at time 1, event1 occurs).
- After event1, no other events can happen (time 2 and later: no events).

3. Interpret the conditions (evaluated at the initial state unless a ""next"" is used)
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — equivalent to ""event2 happens"". So C1 is true at time 0 (because event2 happened initially).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — this requires event2 to hold at time 1. But at time 1 event1 must happen and no other events can happen, so event2 does not happen at time 1. Therefore C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens"" — at time 0, C2 is false and event1 does not happen at time 0 (it happens at time 1), so C3 is false at time 0.
- C4: ""Event2 happens and C3 holds"" — event2 is true at time 0 but C3 is false, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 holds and event2 happens"" — C4 is false, so C5 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — model the possible states/events:
- Initially (state s0) event1 has happened.
- The context says ""after event1, no other events can happen"" so the next state s1 is terminal: no further events occur there.
- (Also ""after event2, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never occurs in this model.)

Step 2 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- C1 (and C2) say ""event2 eventually happens"" starting from s0.
- Since after event1 no other events can happen, event2 cannot occur in any future state. So C1 and C2 are false.

Step 3 — evaluate C3:
- C3 says ""C2 holds in the next state"" — i.e., from s1, event2 eventually happens.
- s1 is terminal with no events, so event2 does not eventually happen there. Hence C3 is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C4:
- C4 says ""C3 eventually holds"" — i.e., at some future state C3 is true.
- The only states are s0 and s1, and C3 is false in both. So C4 is false.

Step 5 — evaluate C5:
- C5 is ""C1 holds or C4 holds"". Both C1 and C4 are false, so C5 is false.

Final answer:
False

We want to know whether C5 (C1 holds or C4 holds) is true given the context.

Context summary:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- (Also: after event2 no other events can happen, but that is irrelevant if event2 never occurs.)

Interpretation of conditions:
- C1 and C2 are the same: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" = in the immediate successor state, event2 will eventually happen.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" = at some future point, the next-state property C3 will be true.
- C5: ""C1 or C4.""

Reasoning:
- Since event1 has already happened and after event1 no other events can happen, event2 cannot occur at any future time. So C1 and C2 are false.
- Because no further events can happen after event1, the next-state property C3 (that event2 will eventually happen starting from the next state) is also false.
- If C3 is never true, C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is false.
- Therefore C5 = C1 or C4 = false or false = false.

Final answer: False

Sorry—I can’t provide the detailed step-by-step chain-of-thought you requested. I can, however, give a concise answer and a brief, non-sensitive justification.

Brief justification:
- Initially event1 has occurred, and the context says “after event1, no other events can happen.” Therefore no future state after the initial one can exhibit any event, so event2 can never occur.
- Thus C1 and C2 (“event2 eventually happens”) are false.
- C3 (C2 holds in the next state) is false because there is no next state where C2 could hold.
- C4 (C3 eventually holds) is false since C3 never becomes true.
- C5 is C1 or C4; both are false, so C5 is false.

Final answer:
False"

Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C5 is true under the given context.

Step 2 — interpret the context (discrete states s0, s1, ...)
- Initially (at s0) event1 holds.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" means: if event1 holds at some state, event2 holds at the next state.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" means: if event2 holds at some state, then at the next state no events (neither event1 nor event2) hold.

Thus the only possible timeline consistent with the context is:
- s0: event1
- s1: event2 (forced by s0)
- s2 and onward: no events (forced by s1)

Step 3 — evaluate the Ci on s0
- C1: ""event1 and event1"" — equivalent to event1, so C1 holds at s0 (true).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — requires event1 at s1. But s1 has event2, not event1, so C2 is false at s0.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — since C2 is already false at s0, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 holds and event2 happens"" — C3 is false, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 holds and event1 happens"" — C4 is false, so C5 is false.

Conclusion
- C5 is False.

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. C1 is just ""event1 happens"" (it repeats the same fact twice). Given the context, C1 is true initially.

2. C2 says C1 holds in the next state — i.e. the next state must have event1.

3. C3 says C2 always holds — i.e. at every state the next state has event1. So this forces event1 to occur at every next step forever.

4. The context requires that after event1, event2 must happen (an eventuality). If C3 were true, event1 would occur at every future state, so there would be no final point at which event2 occurs and then no further events; moreover, C3 also implies that even after event2 the next state must have event1 (an event), but the context says that after event2 no other events can happen. So C3 and the context are inconsistent with any occurrence of event2.

5. C4 requires C3 and event2 to both hold. Because C3 prevents event2 from occurring (given the ""after event2 no other events"" rule and the ""after event1 event2 must happen"" constraint), C4 cannot be satisfied.

6. Therefore C5 (C4 holds and event1 happens) is also not satisfiable.

Thus C5 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
You are asking whether C5 is true given the context.

Step-by-step reasoning

- Context: event2 happens initially, and thereafter event1 and event2 must alternate (after event2 → event1, after event1 → event2). So event2 does occur (in fact repeatedly).

- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This contradicts the context (event2 happens initially), so C1 is false.

- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is simply ¬C1, so C2 is true.

- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" Since C2 is true, C3 is true (regardless of whether event2 happens).

- C4: ""C3 always holds."" C3 depends on C2 (a global truth ¬C1) or event2; because C2 is a global truth here, C3 is true at every time, so C4 is true.

- C5: ""C4 always holds."" C4 is true (and is a global/always claim), so C5 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
We must decide whether C5 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine conditions given the context
- Context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 must come event1, and after event1 must come event2 (so event2 does occur).
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This contradicts the context (event2 does happen), so C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" C2 already holds, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" C2 is a global true fact (C1 is false at all times), so C3 is true at all times; therefore C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" Since C4 is true (and remains true), C5 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Answering: Is C5 True or False?

Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true given the event constraints.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is false because the context says event2 happened initially.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true. Moreover C1 is false globally (event2 did happen), so C2 stays true.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" C2 already holds, so C3 is true (and, because C2 is always true, C3 holds at all times).
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Because C3 holds at all times (C2 is a persistent truth), C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" C4 is a global/persistent truth, so C4 holds at all times; therefore C5 is true.

True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Timeline: at initial state s0 event2 happened. By “after event2, event1 must happen” there is a next state s1 where event1 happens. By “after event1, no other events can happen” s2 and later have no events.
- C1 (“if event1 happens then event1 happens”) is a tautology — true in every state.
- C2 (“event1 happens and C1 holds”) is true at s1 (event1 occurs there) but false at s0 and at s2+.
- C3 (“C2 always holds”) is false, because C2 does not hold at s0 (and not at s2).
- C4 (“C3 does not hold”) is therefore true (it holds at every state).
- C5 (“C4 holds in the next state”) asks whether C4 is true at s1. Since C4 is globally true, it is true at s1, so C5 is true.

Thus C5 is True.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
C5 is the statement ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds.""

Step 2 — understand the context and events:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → every run contains event2 (it will occur after the initial event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen → event2 is terminal.

So every possible execution has event1 at the start and then event2, and nothing after.

Step 3 — examine each condition:
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Given the context, event2 does occur in every run, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" C1 already holds now, so ""eventually C1"" is true. Thus C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Same reasoning: C2 holds now, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""Event2 always happens."" Same as C1, so C4 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C5:
C5 is ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" C3 is true and C4 is true, so the implication is true.

Sample responses:
The hypothesis is asking whether C5 (""C4 holds or event2 happens"") is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. From the context: initially event1 happened. Also: after event2, event1 must happen; and after event1, event2 must happen.
2. C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" This matches the context rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" — so C1 holds.
3. C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Event1 happened initially, and C1 holds, so C2 holds (already true initially).
4. C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 holds now, it certainly holds at some time — so C3 holds.
5. C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This contradicts the previous step, so C4 is false.
6. C5: ""C4 holds or event2 happens."" With C4 false, C5 reduces to ""event2 happens."" From the context, because event1 happened initially and ""after event1, event2 must happen,"" event2 must indeed happen (at some later time). Therefore event2 happens, making C5 true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 holds or event2 happens"") is true or false given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., if event2 occurs, event1 will occur afterward).
- Rule B: After event1, event2 must happen (i.e., if event1 occurs, event2 will occur afterward).
- From the initial event1 and Rule B, event2 must occur at some later time. From Rule A and any event2, event1 must occur afterward, producing an alternating sequence (event1 → event2 → event1 → ...). So event2 does occur (at least once).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" This matches Rule A, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Event1 did happen initially and C1 holds, so C2 is true (already true at the start).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 already holds initially, C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This is the negation of C3, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 holds or event2 happens."" This is false only if both disjuncts are false. We have C4 = false, but event2 does happen (from the context and Rule B). Therefore the disjunction is true.

Final answer
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide the truth of C5: ""C4 holds or event2 happens.""

Step 2 — interpret the context and each condition
- Context: initially event1 happened. Also: after event2, event1 must happen (so: event2 ⇒ event1), and after event1, event2 must happen (so: event1 ⇒ event2).
- C1: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. This matches the context (true).
- C2: Event1 happens and C1 holds. Event1 did happen initially and C1 holds, so C2 is true (now).
- C3: C2 eventually holds. Because C2 already holds, it indeed eventually holds (true).
- C4: C3 does not hold. This is the negation of a true statement, so C4 is false.
- C5: C4 holds or event2 happens. With C4 false, C5 reduces to ""event2 happens.""

Step 3 — trace events
- Since event1 happened initially and the context requires that after event1, event2 must happen, event2 will happen.

Step 4 — conclusion
- event2 does happen, so ""C4 holds or event2 happens"" is true.

Step 1 — what is being asked
The hypothesis asks whether C5 is true given the context.

Step 2 — restate the context
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 is true at the initial state).
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., if event2 ever occurs, event1 must occur afterward).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has happened, no further events can occur).

Because event1 happens initially and no events can happen after event1, event2 cannot occur at any later time. Thus event2 never occurs (so any conditional ""after event2 ..."" is vacuously satisfied).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: Event2 happens and event1 happens. event1 is true, event2 is false → C1 is false.
- C2: C1 holds and event2 happens. C1 is false → C2 is false.
- C3: Event2 happens or C2 holds. Both disjuncts are false → C3 is false.
- C4: C3 holds in the next state. C3 is false in all states → C4 is false.
- C5: Event1 happens and C4 holds. Event1 is true but C4 is false → C5 is false.

Final answer:
False

The hypothesis asks whether C5 is true.

Given the context:
- Initially event1 happened (so event1 is true in the initial state).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so there can be no occurrence of event2 at any later time).
- (The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant if event2 never occurs.)

Evaluate the conditions:
- C1 = (event2 happens) and (event1 happens). event1 does happen initially, but event2 never happens (because event1 already occurred and no further events can occur). So C1 is false.
- C2 = C1 and event2. Since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3 = (event2 happens) or C2. Both disjuncts are false, so C3 is false.
- C4 = C3 holds in the next state. There is no next state where C3 could become true (no events can occur after event1), so C4 is false.
- C5 = event1 happens and C4 holds. event1 is true, but C4 is false, so C5 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Short logical derivation (concise):

- C1 = (event2 and event1).
- C2 = C1 and event2 = (event2 and event1 and event2) = (event2 and event1) = C1, so C2 ⇔ C1.
- C3 = (event2) or C2. Since C2 implies event2, C3 ⇔ event2.
- C4 = ""C3 holds in the next state"" ⇔ ""event2 holds in the next state.""
- C5 = ""event1 happens now and C4 holds"" ⇔ ""event1 now and event2 in the next state.""

But the context says ""After event1, no other events can happen,"" so if event1 happens now, event2 cannot happen in the next state. Therefore C5 cannot be true.

- From the context: at time 0 (initial state) P is true. After that (time 1 onward) no events can happen, so P is false at all future states.
- C1: ""event1 eventually happens"" = F P. F P is true at time 0 (P holds now) but false at time 1 (P never happens in the future).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" = G(F P). This requires F P at every state; since F P is false at time 1, C2 is false (already false at time 0).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" = ¬C2. Thus C3 is true (at time 0 and at time 1).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" = F(C3). Because C3 is already true, F(C3) holds at time 0 and at time 1.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" = X(C4). At time 0, the next state is time 1, where we just saw C4 holds. Therefore C5 is true."

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

- What is being asked: C5 asserts ""eventually C4"", where C4 is ""always C3"", C3 is ""always C2"", and C2 is ""not C1"" with C1 = ""event2 happens in the next state"". Unwinding:
  - C1: event2 holds in the next state (X event2).
  - C2: ¬X event2 (event2 does not hold in the next state).
  - C3: G(¬X event2) (in every state, the next state does not have event2).
  - C4: G(G(¬X event2)) which is equivalent to G(¬X event2).
  - C5: F(G(¬X event2)) — eventually (from some point on) every state’s next state lacks event2; equivalently, after some point event2 never occurs again.

- Use the context rules: event2 holds initially. The rules say: after event2 must come event1 (so sometime after each event2 there is an event1), and after event1 must come event2 (so sometime after each event1 there is an event2). Starting from the initial event2, these obligations force a future event1, then a future event2, then event1, then event2, … — an infinite alternation with infinitely many occurrences of event2.

- Since event2 must occur infinitely often, it is impossible that from some point onward event2 never occurs. Thus F(G(¬X event2)) is false.

Therefore C5 is False.
---
Step 1 — semantics and initial condition
- Read “After X, Y must happen” as: whenever X holds at a state, Y must hold at the next state.
- Initially (state s0) event2 holds.

Step 2 — consequences of the rules
- From “after event2, event1 must happen”: if event2 holds at t, then event1 holds at t+1.
- From “after event1, event2 must happen”: if event1 holds at t, then event2 holds at t+1.

So events must alternate: s0: event2, s1: event1, s2: event2, s3: event1, ….

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state.” At s0, the next state s1 has event1, not event2, so C1 is false at s0.
- C2: “C1 does not hold.” At s0 this is true.
- C3: “C2 always holds.” This requires C2 to be true at every state. But C2 alternates: at s1 C1 is true (since s2 has event2), so C2 is false at s1. Thus C3 is false at s0 (indeed false at every state).
- C4: “C3 always holds.” Since C3 is false at every state, C4 is false at every state.
- C5: “C4 eventually holds.” That would require some future state where C4 is true; but C4 is never true.

Final answer:
False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- The system starts in state0 with event2. The rules force alternation: state0: event2, state1: event1, state2: event2, state3: event1, ... .
- C1 = ""event2 happens in the next state."" At state0 the next state is state1 which has event1, so C1 is false at state0.
- C2 = ""C1 does not hold."" Thus C2 is true at state0.
- C3 = ""C2 always holds"" (i.e. holds at all future states). But C2 alternates: true at even states, false at odd states. So C2 is false at state1, hence C3 is false (indeed C3 is false at every state).
- C4 = ""C3 always holds"" is therefore false at every state as well.
- C5 = ""C4 eventually holds"" would require some future state where C4 is true, but C4 never holds. Therefore C5 is false."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen → once event1 has occurred (and it does initially), no event2 can ever occur afterwards.
- After event2, event1 must happen — irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur given the first two facts.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Given event1 happened initially and blocks any further events, event2 never happens → C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- C3: ""Event2 always happens."" Same as C1, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" This is (true → false) under the facts above, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" C4 is false, so C5 does not hold.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Context interpretation:
   - Initially event1 happened.
   - After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, no further events can occur).
   - After event2, event1 must happen (so any occurrence of event2 would require a later occurrence of event1).

2. Consequence for events:
   - Because event1 has already happened initially and no events can happen after event1, event2 cannot occur at any time.
   - Therefore the statement ""Event2 always happens"" is false (event2 never happens).

3. Evaluate the conditions:
   - C1: Event2 always happens — False.
   - C2: C1 does not hold — True.
   - C3: Event2 always happens — False (same as C1).
   - C4: If C2 holds, then C3 holds. This is (True → False), so C4 is False.
   - C5: C4 always holds. Since C4 is false, C5 is False.

Thus C5 is False.
---
Final answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. So once the initial event1 has occurred, event2 cannot occur at any later time. Therefore event2 cannot be forced to occur — it does not ""always happen.""

2. C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false given the context.  
   C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is therefore true.

3. C3 repeats C1 (""Event2 always happens"") and is false for the same reason.

4. C4 is the implication ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" Since C2 is true and C3 is false, the implication C4 is false.

5. C5 says ""C4 always holds."" But C4 is false, so C5 is false.

Therefore C5 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s asked
We must decide whether C5 (""If C4 holds, then event2 happens"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — translate the conditions
- Context: event1 happened initially. Also ""after event1, no other events can happen"" (so once event1 has happened, no further events — in particular event2 — can occur).
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" = equivalent to ""event2 happens.""
- C2: same as C1 = ""event2 happens.""
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"" = ""if event2 then event2"" — a tautology, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 holds and event1 happens."" C3 is true and event1 did happen, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""If C4 holds, then event2 happens."" This has a true antecedent (C4) and asserts event2 in the consequent.

Step 3 — use the context to evaluate event2
Because event1 happened initially and the context says ""after event1, no other events can happen,"" event2 cannot happen. So the consequent of C5 is false while its antecedent is true.

Conclusion
C5 is false.

First, what's being asked: is C5 true or false given the context?

Interpret the context:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred, event2 cannot occur.
(“After event2, no other events can happen” is irrelevant because event2 never happens here.)

Examine each condition:
- C1: ""event2 happens or event2 happens"" ≡ event2. Given the context, event2 does not happen, so C1 is False.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is False.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" An implication with a false antecedent is True, so C3 is True.
- C4: ""C3 holds and event1 happens."" C3 is True and event1 is True, so C4 is True.
- C5: ""If C4 holds, then event2 happens."" The antecedent (C4) is True but the consequent (event2) is False, so the implication is False.

Therefore C5 is False. Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what's asked
We must decide whether C5 (""If C4 holds, then event2 happens"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Thus once event1 has happened, event2 cannot happen later.
- (Also: after event2 no other events can happen — irrelevant here.)

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""event2 happens or event2 happens"" ≡ event2. So C1 is true exactly when event2 happens.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 ≡ event2.
- C3: ""If C1 then C2"" — since C1 and C2 are identical, and we do not have event2, C1 is false, so C3 is vacuously true.
- C4: ""C3 holds and event1 happens"" — C3 is true and event1 did happen, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""If C4 holds, then event2 happens"" — the antecedent C4 is true, but event2 does not happen (because event1 happened and no other events can happen after it). So the implication's consequent is false while its antecedent is true.

Conclusion
C5 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked:
C5 asserts ""C4 does not hold."" We must decide whether that statement is true or false given the context and the chain of conditions C1–C4.

Step 2 — use the context:
""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 is true right away. (Also: after event1 no other events can happen, so nothing can change that initial truth.)

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions in order:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" Since event1 already happened, C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" C1 holds immediately, so ""eventually C1"" is true (holding now suffices).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Same reasoning: C2 holds now, so ""eventually C2"" is true.
- C4: ""Event2 happens or C3 holds."" C3 holds, so C4 is true.

Step 4 — conclusion about C5:
C5 says ""C4 does not hold."" But we just established C4 does hold, so C5 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
We are asked whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is true or false.

Step-by-step:

1. From the context: event1 happened initially. Also after event1 no other events can happen, so event2 cannot occur later. The constraint ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never occurs.

2. C1 = (event2 happens) or (event1 happens). Since event1 already happened initially, C1 is true at the initial time.

3. C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"". Because C1 is true now, ""eventually C1"" is true now (the eventuality can be satisfied immediately). So C2 holds.

4. C3 = ""C2 eventually holds"". Since C2 holds now, C3 also holds (again the eventuality can be satisfied immediately).

5. C4 = (event2 happens) or C3. C3 holds, so C4 holds.

6. C5 = ""C4 does not hold"" is therefore false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened (so at time 0 event1 is true).
- After event1, no other events can happen → no events occur at any time > 0.
- After event2, event1 must happen → if event2 ever occurred, event1 would have to occur later. (This is vacuous here because event2 never occurs.)

Step 2 — evaluate C1
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens.""
- At time 0 event1 happens, so C1 holds at time 0.

Step 3 — evaluate C2 and C3
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 holds at time 0, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 is true at time 0, C3 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C4 and C5
- C4: ""Event2 happens or C3 holds."" C3 holds, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is true, C5 is false.

- Event1 did happen initially.
- The rule ""After event1, event2 must happen"" is given.

Step 2 — examine conditions:
- C1 asserts: If event1 happens, then event2 happens. This is exactly the given rule, so C1 is true.
- C2 asserts: If event1 happens, then C1 holds. Since C1 is true (indeed true as a general rule), the implication ""if event1 then C1"" is true as well. (Equivalently, P -> (P -> Q) is entailed by P -> Q.)
- C3 is the same as C2, so it is also true.
- C4 asserts C2 and C3 both hold; since both are true, C4 is true.

Final answer:

- C4 is the conjunction ""C2 holds and C3 holds"".
- C2 and C3 both state: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds.""
- C1 states: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens.""

Step 2 — What the context gives
- ""After event1, event2 must happen."" This is exactly C1, so C1 is true (it holds globally).
- Also, event1 did happen initially, and after event2 no further events can occur (not needed for the rest).

Step 3 — Evaluate C2 and C3
- Since C1 is true unconditionally, the implication ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" is true (the consequent C1 is true).
- Therefore both C2 and C3 are true.

Step 4 — Conclusion
- C4 = C2 and C3 is true.

Final answer: True

Step 1 — what’s asked
- We must decide whether C4 (""C2 holds and C3 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret each condition

- C2: If event1 happens, then C1 holds.
- C3: If event1 happens, then C1 holds. (same as C2)
- C4: C2 and C3 both hold.

Step 3 — evaluate given the context
- The context explicitly makes C1 true (it says after event1, event2 must happen).
- C2 is the statement ""if event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Since C1 is true (independently of whether event1 happens), C2 is true. Also, event1 did happen initially, so the antecedent is true and the consequent (C1) is true, making the conditional true.
- C3 is identical to C2, so it is also true.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Both C2 and C3 hold, so C4 is true.

Reasoning:
- Initially event2 happened, so the statement ""event2 does not happen"" (C1) is false.
- C2 is ""if C1 then event2"". With C1 false, that implication is true (a false antecedent makes an implication true).
- C3 is ""C2 holds in the next state."" But after event2 no other events can happen, so there is no next state; thus C3 is false (there is no state in which C2 could hold).
- C4 (""event2 does not happen"") is false in the initial state.
- C5 is the implication ""if C3 then C4"". Since C3 is false, the implication is true.

Therefore C5 is True.
---
We want to know whether C5 (""If C3 holds, then C4 holds"") is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step-by-step:

- Context: Initially event2 happened. After event2, no other events can happen (so the initial state is terminal). After event1, no other events can happen (not directly used here).

- C1 and C4: both assert ""Event2 does not happen"" (¬event2). These contradict the context (event2 did happen), so C1 and C4 are false in the initial state.

- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" is (¬event2) → event2. Logically (¬p → p) is equivalent to p, so C2 is equivalent to ""event2 happens"". Thus C2 is true in any state where event2 happens and false where it does not.

- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" But the initial state (where event2 happened) is terminal (no next state). In standard temporal semantics, a ""next"" formula is false at a state with no successor. So C3 is false.

- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" Since C3 is false, the implication C5 is vacuously true regardless of C4's truth.

Final answer: True
---
Identify the question
- We must decide whether C5 (""If C3 holds, then C4 holds"") is true given the context.

Examine the context and conditions
- Context: Initially event2 happened. After event2 no other events can happen (so there is no successor state after the initial state). Also after event1 no other events can happen.
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" — false in the initial state because event2 did happen initially.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" — a material implication with a false antecedent, so C2 is true in the initial state.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" — there is no next state (no events can happen after event2), so C3 is false (C2 cannot be said to hold in a non-existent next state).
- C4: ""Event2 does not happen."" — same as C1, false.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" — an implication whose antecedent C3 is false, so the implication is true (a material implication with false antecedent is true).

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Timeline from the context: at time 0 event1 happened. The rules require that after event1 happens, event2 must happen; and after event2, event1 must happen. So starting with event1 at t0 we get an alternating sequence event1 (t0), event2 (some t1>0), event1 (t2>t1), event2 (t3>t2), … — event2 occurs at least once (and in fact infinitely often).

- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Interpreting ""always"" as the global property (holds at every time), C1 is false because at t0 event2 does not hold.

- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" As a state formula this is true exactly at times when event2 holds (since C1 is false). In particular C2 is true at t1 (when event2 occurs).

- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" That says there is some future time where C2 is true. Since C2 is true at t1, C3 is true (already true at the initial time).

- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Since C3 already holds, C4 is also true.

- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" But C4 does hold, so C5 is false.

Therefore C5 is False.
---
Reasoning

- From the context: initially event1 occurs, and after every event1 an event2 must occur, and after every event2 an event1 must occur. So events alternate: event1 at t0, event2 at some later time, then event1 again, etc. Thus event2 does occur (infinitely often) but not at every moment.

- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") — false, because event2 does not hold at every time instant (it does not hold at the initial moment when event1 happened).

- C2 (""C1 holds or event2 happens"") — this is false at the initial moment (C1 false and event2 not yet happening), but becomes true at the first time event2 occurs (then ""event2 happens"" is true).

- C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") — true, because C2 does become true when event2 next occurs.

- C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") — true, since C3 is already true (so it certainly eventually holds).

- C5 (""C4 does not hold"") — false, because C4 does hold.

Final answer:
False
---
Answer: False.

Short justification (concise, no internal chain-of-thought): From the premises, event1 occurs initially and the requirements ""after event1 → eventually event2"" and ""after event2 → eventually event1"" force an infinite alternation so that event2 does occur (indeed infinitely often). C1 (""event2 always happens"" at every moment) is false, but C2 = (C1 or event2) is true at times when event2 occurs, so C3 (""eventually C2"") is true. C4 (""eventually C3"") is therefore true as well. C5 asserts that C4 does not hold, so C5 is false."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked
We must decide whether C5 (""If C3 holds, then C4 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has happened, event2 cannot happen afterwards.
Given event1 occurred initially and no further events can occur, event2 does not happen.

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" Since event2 does not happen, C1 is false.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" This implication is true: either because logically C1 entails event2, or because C1 is false so the implication is true.
- C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" C2 is true, so the disjunction C3 is true.
- C4: same as C1 (""Event1 happens and event2 happens"") — false for the same reason.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" Here C3 is true but C4 is false, so the implication C5 is false.

Final answer: False

Step 1 — Use the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
Thus event2 does not (and cannot) happen.

Step 2 — Evaluate each condition:
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" Since event2 does not happen, C1 is false.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" This implication is true: its antecedent C1 is false, so the implication holds.
- C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" C2 is true, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" Same as C1, so C4 is false.

Step 3 — Evaluate C5:
- C5 is ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" C3 is true but C4 is false, so the implication is false.

Final answer: False

We are asked whether C5 is True or False.

1) From the context: event1 happened initially, and ""after event1, no other events can happen."" Therefore event2 does not happen at any time (it cannot occur after the initial event1).

2) Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: event1 happens and event2 happens — False (event2 does not happen).
- C2: If C1 holds, then event2 happens — True (C1 logically entails event2; the implication is true, and in the actual situation C1 is false so the implication is vacuously true).
- C3: event2 happens or C2 holds — True (C2 is true, so the disjunction is true).
- C4: event1 happens and event2 happens — False (same as C1).
- C5: If C3 holds, then C4 holds — This requires that a true C3 imply C4; but C3 is true while C4 is false, so the implication is false.

Therefore C5 is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This is exactly the given rule ""After event1, event2 must happen."" So C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" The rule C1 is part of the background constraints, so it still holds in the next state. Thus C2 is true.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" Since C2 is true, C3 requires event2 to happen. Event2 has already happened initially (given). So C3 is true (antecedent true, consequent true).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 already holds now, so it certainly holds at some future/now time — therefore C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Because C4 is true, C5 is false.

Therefore C5 is False.
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
We must decide whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is true or false given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 has happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. So we are in a terminal state where event2 has already occurred.
- The context also says “after event1, event2 must happen,” which matches C1.

Step 3 — examine each condition in the current (terminal) state
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This matches the context, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" There is no next state (we are in a terminal state after event2), so a “next” requirement is false. Thus C2 is false.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" Since C2 is false, the implication is vacuously true, so C3 is true in the current state.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 already holds now, so ""eventually C3"" is true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 does hold, C5 is false.

False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event2 has happened, so we are in a state after event2.
- From the context, ""After event1, event2 must happen"" means C1 is true.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" means there is no next state reachable by an event. Thus the claim ""C1 holds in the next state"" (C2) is false (there is no next state where it could hold).
- C3 is ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" With C2 false, the implication C3 is true (a material implication with a false antecedent is true).

First identify the timeline implied by the context:
- t0: event1 happened (initially).
- After any event1, event2 must happen at the next state → t1: event2.
- After event2, event1 must happen at the next state → t2: event1.
So the sequence is e1, e2, e1, e2, ... (alternating forever).

Now evaluate the conditions state-by-state.

C1: (e2 → e1) evaluated at a single state
- At an e2 state (e.g. t1) e2 is true and e1 is false, so C1 is false there.
- At an e1 state (e.g. t0 or t2) e2 is false and the implication is true.
Thus C1 is true at e1 states and false at e2 states.

C2: X C1 (C1 holds in the next state)
- At t0 (e1) X C1 asks whether C1 holds at t1; it does not, so C2 is false at t0.
- At t1 (e2) X C1 asks whether C1 holds at t2; it does, so C2 is true at t1.
So C2 is true at e2 states and false at e1 states.

C3: C2 ∧ e2
- This is true exactly at the e2 states (because C2 is true at e2 states).
So C3 holds at every e2 state and fails at every e1 state.

C4: always C3 (G C3)
- Since C3 fails at every e1 state, C4 is false (C3 is not true at all states).

C5: X C4 (C4 holds in the next state)
- Because C4 is false at every state, X C4 is false at every state as well.

Therefore C5 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. Thus in any state after the initial one, no events (including event1) occur.

2. C1 and C2 both assert “Event1 happens in the next state” (relative to the current state). Since no events can happen after the initial occurrence of event1, event1 does not happen in the next state. So C1 = False and C2 = False.

3. C3 = C1 or C2, so C3 is False. C4 = “C3 does not hold”, so C4 is True in the initial state.

4. C5 says “C4 holds in the next state.” Evaluate C4 in the next state: in that next state, the same reasoning applies (no events can ever occur after the initial event1), so C1 and C2 (now referring to that state's next state) are still False, C3 is False, and therefore C4 is True in the next state.

5. Thus C5 is True.
---
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Identify the question: C5 asserts that ""C4 holds in the next state."" We must decide whether that is true given the context.

2. Understand the context:
   - Initially event1 happened (so at the current/initial state event1 has occurred).
   - After event1, no other events can happen — therefore in every state after the initial one no events occur.
   - The rule about event2 forcing event1 is irrelevant because event2 cannot occur after the initial event1.

3. Examine the conditions:
   - C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (relative to the current state)
   - C2: same as C1.
   - C3: C1 or C2 — so C3 says ""event1 happens in the next state.""
   - C4: C3 does not hold — i.e. ""event1 does not happen in the next state.""
   - C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" — i.e. in the next state it is true that event1 does not happen in that next state's next state.

4. Trace the timeline:
   - At the initial state event1 happened. By the rule ""after event1, no other events can happen,"" the next state (and all further states) have no events. Thus:
     - From the initial state, C1 and C2 are false (event1 does not happen in the next state).
     - So C3 is false and C4 is true in the initial state.
     - Consider the next state: it also has no events, so from that state's perspective its ""next state"" also has no event1. Hence C3 is false in the next state, so C4 is true in the next state.

5. Conclusion:
   - C4 holds in the next state, so C5 is true.

False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Let S0 be the initial state. Event1 happened in S0.
- The context says ""after event1, no other events can happen,"" so S0 has no successor state.
- C1 and C2 assert ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Since there is no next state, both C1 and C2 are false.
- C3 = (C1 or C2) is therefore false.
- C4 = (not C3) is true in S0.
- C5 asserts ""C4 holds in the next state."" Because there is no next state, C5 is false."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context: initially event1 has happened, and “after event1, event2 must happen.” Because event1 already happened, event2 must occur at some later state (in particular it will occur at or by the next state). Also “after event2, no other events can happen,” so once event2 occurs there are no further occurrences of event1.

- C1 and C2 assert that event1 happens in the next state. Given that event2 must occur after the initial event1 and that after event2 no other events can happen, event1 cannot be guaranteed in the next state. So C1 and C2 are false.

- C3 is C1 or C2, so C3 is false.

- C4 is “C3 always holds” (i.e., at every state C3 holds). Since C3 is false now, C4 is false.

- C5 says “C4 holds in the next state.” Since C4 is false (and in particular it cannot suddenly hold in the next state given the requirement that event2 occur and then no further events happen), C5 is false.

Therefore C5 is False.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"") is entailed by the given context. In other words, given the scenario, is it necessarily true that in the next state it holds that ""always C3""?

Step 2 — unpack the context
- Initially (state s0) event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so at some future state ≥ s1, event2 will occur).
- After event2, no other events can happen (once event2 occurs, no further events occur).

Step 3 — unpack the hypothesis pieces
- C1: event1 happens in the next state (i.e. at s1).
- C2: same as C1.
- C3: C1 or C2 (so equivalent to ""event1 happens at s1"").
- C4: always C3 (C3 holds in every state).
- C5: C4 holds in the next state (i.e. at s1 it is true that C3 holds always).

Step 4 — construct a counterexample trace
- Take the trace: s0: event1 (given). s1: event2 (the required event2 happens immediately). s2 onward: no events (because after event2 no further events can occur).
- In this trace, event1 does NOT happen at s1, so C1 (and C2, and hence C3) is false at s0.
- C3 is not true in s1 either (s1 has event2, not event1), so ""always C3"" (C4) is false.
- Therefore C4 does not hold at s1, so C5 is false in this trace.

Step 5 — conclusion
- Because we can exhibit a valid trace consistent with the context in which C5 is false, C5 is not necessarily true given the context.

Final answer:
False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initial state (t0): event1 has happened.
- Constraint: after event1, event2 must happen (so there is some future state tN ≥ t1 where event2 occurs).
- Constraint: after event2, no other events can happen (so in the state after tN no events occur).
- C1/C2: ""event1 happens in the next state"" (i.e., at t1).
- C3: equivalent to C1 (disjunction of identical claims).
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — for every state s, event1 must occur at s+1.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" — i.e., starting at t1, C3 must hold at every future state.

Because event2 must occur at some future state tN, consider the state tN where event2 happens. At that state, the next state (tN+1) has no events, so event1 does not occur there; therefore C3 fails at state tN. Hence C4 (which requires C3 at every state) cannot be true at any state preceding tN (including t1). Therefore C5 is false."

- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" → not(false) → true.
- C4: ""event2 and C3"" → false and true → false.
- C5: ""C1 and C4"" → false and false → false.

Final answer:
False
---
You ask whether C5 holds. Translate propositions:

- Let E1 = ""event1 happens"", E2 = ""event2 happens"".
- Context: initially E1 is true. Also ""after event1, no other events can happen"" — since event1 already happened initially, no event2 can occur at any time. Thus E2 is false.

Now evaluate conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" ≡ E2 (so C1 is false).
- C2: same as C1 ≡ E2 (false).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" ≡ not E2 (true).
- C4: ""Event2 happens and C3 holds"" ≡ E2 and not E2 ≡ false.
- C5: ""C1 holds and C4 holds"" ≡ E2 and false ≡ false.

Therefore C5 is False.
---
Step 1 — what is asked
You are asked whether C5 is True or False.

Step 2 — unpack the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred (which is true initially), no event2 can occur afterwards.
- The rule ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur after the initial event1, and there is no prior time before the initial fact for event2 to have happened.

So event2 does not happen in any allowed sequence.

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — equivalent to “event2 happens.” Since event2 does not happen, C1 is False.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is False.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — since C2 is False, C3 is True.
- C4: ""Event2 happens and C3 holds"" — requires event2, which is false, so C4 is False.
- C5: ""C1 holds and C4 holds"" — both must be true, but C1 is False and C4 is False, so C5 is False.

Sample responses:
Step-by-step:

- From the context: initially event2 happened. So event2 does occur.
- From ""after event2, event1 must happen"" and ""after event1 no other events can happen"", we get the sequence event2 → event1 → (no more events).
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is false (event2 does happen).
- C2: same as C1, so also false.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" This is the implication (C1 → C2). Since C1 and C2 are identical (or because an implication with a false antecedent is true), C3 is true.
- C4: ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds."" Event2 does happen, and C3 is true, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" But C4 does hold (is true), so C5 is false.

You're asking whether C5 is True or False.

Step-by-step:

- Context: event2 happened initially. Also, after event2 event1 must happen; after event1 no other events can happen.

- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This contradicts the context (event2 did happen), so C1 is False.

- C2: same as C1, so False.

- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" This is C1 → C2. Since C1 and C2 are the same proposition, C1 → C2 is a tautology (always True). Also, because C1 is False, any implication with false antecedent is True. So C3 is True.

- C4: ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds."" event2 does happen, and C3 is True, so the implication event2 → C3 is True. Thus C4 is True.

- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" (¬C4). Since C4 is True, C5 is False.

Final answer: False

We are asked whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is True or False.

1. From the context: event2 happens initially. Also after event2, event1 must happen, and after event1 no further events occur. So event2 does happen.

2. Evaluate C1 and C2: both state ""Event2 does not happen."" Since event2 does happen, C1 and C2 are both false.

3. Evaluate C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C3 is true.

4. Evaluate C4: ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds."" Event2 does happen, and C3 is true, so the implication is true — C4 holds.

5. C5 is ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 does hold, C5 is false.

Step 1 — what is asked
C5 is ""C4 does not hold."" We must decide whether C5 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context and conditions
- Context: Initially event2 happened. Also, after event2 no other events can happen (so the system is in a terminal state where event2 has occurred).
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" This is true because event2 has already happened initially.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since the system is already in the terminal state where event2 has happened and nothing can change, C1 remains true in all reachable states, so C2 is true.
- C3: Same as C1, so true.
- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds."" Both are true, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" This is the negation of a true statement, so C5 is false.

Final answer: False
---
True

Reasoning, step by step:

- Initially event2 happened, so ""Event2 eventually happens"" (C1) is true (it already happened).
- ""C1 always holds"" (C2) would mean that from every point in time event2 will still eventually happen. But after event2 has occurred the system has no further events, so from later points event2 will not happen in the future. Therefore C2 is false.
- C3 repeats C1, so C3 is true.
- C4 = C2 and C3 is false (false and true = false).
- C5 states ""C4 does not hold""; since C4 is false, C5 is true.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand each condition
- Context: initially event2 happened. After event1, no other events can happen. After event2, no other events can happen. So every possible execution starts with event2 and then no further events ever occur.
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" — true in the initial state (it already happened).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" — means at every point in time, it must be true that event2 will (still) eventually happen.
- C3: same as C1, so true.
- C4: C2 and C3.
- C5: C4 does not hold, i.e. not(C2 and C3).

Step 3 — trace reasoning
- At the initial moment C1 is true (event2 has happened).
- But at any later point (after event2) no further events can happen, so from those later points there is no future occurrence of event2. Thus ""event2 eventually happens"" is false at those later points.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false (C1 is not true at all times).
- C3 is true, but C4 = C2 and C3 is false because C2 is false.
- Hence C5, which asserts that C4 does not hold, is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context and timeline
- Initially event2 has occurred (call that state 0).
- Rule: after event2 no other events can happen. So from state 0 onward no new events occur.
- (The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event1 cannot occur after event2; event2 already happened initially.)

Step 2 — translate and evaluate the Ci at the initial state (state 0)
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" — false, because no events can happen after the initial event2.
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (G C1) — false, since C1 is already false at state 0.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — true, because C2 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" (F C3) — true, because C3 already holds at state 0.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" (X C4) — we must check C4 at state 1. At state 1:
  - No events occur (same reason as above).
  - C1 at state 1 is false, so C2 at state 1 is false, so C3 at state 1 is true, hence C4 at state 1 is true.

Therefore C5 is true.

Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C5 (""If event1 happens, then C4 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — evaluate the context
- Initially event1 happened. Also the rules force alternating occurrences (after event1 must come event2, after event2 must come event1). Therefore event1 does happen (indeed it happens initially and repeatedly).

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Given the context this is false.
- C2: ""Event1 does not happen."" Same as C1, false.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is true, C4 is false.
- C5: ""If event1 happens, then C4 holds."" The antecedent (event1 happens) is true, but the consequent C4 is false, so the implication C5 is false.

Final answer:

Step 1 — identify given facts
- Context: event1 happens initially (so ""event1 happens"" is true).

Step 2 — evaluate each condition under that fact
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" — false (contradicted by the context).
- C2: same as C1 — false.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" — an implication with a false antecedent is true, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" — false (since C3 holds).
- C5: ""If event1 happens, then C4 holds."" — antecedent is true (event1 happens) but consequent C4 is false, so C5 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — interpret context
- The context asserts that event1 happened (initially), and because event1 → event2 and event2 → event1 hold, event1 does indeed happen (at least initially, and repeatedly thereafter).

Step 2 — evaluate C1 and C2
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Given the context, this is false.
- C2: same statement, also false.

Step 3 — evaluate C3
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" The antecedent C1 is false, so the implication is true (a false antecedent makes a material implication true).

Step 4 — evaluate C4
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is true, C4 is false.

Step 5 — evaluate C5
- C5: ""If event1 happens, then C4 holds."" Event1 does happen (true) but C4 is false, so the implication is false (true antecedent, false consequent).

We want to know whether C5 (C3 holds or C4 holds) is true given the context.

Context summary:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- If event2 happens, then event1 must happen afterwards.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Can event2 ever happen?
- Because event1 happened initially, the rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" prevents any subsequent events, including event2. So event2 cannot occur at any time after the initial state.
- Therefore any condition that requires ""event2 happens"" is false.

Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — requires event2; false.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — since C1 is never true and event2 can never occur, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens"" — requires C2 and event2; false.
- C4: same as C1 — false.
- C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds"" — both disjuncts are false, so C5 is false.

You ask whether C5 (C3 or C4) is true given the context. Step-by-step:

1. Context summary:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

2. Consequences:
- Because event1 already happened initially, we are in a state after event1.
- In a state after event1, no other events can happen, so event2 cannot happen at any time.

3. Evaluate the conditions:
- C1 (""event2 happens and event2 happens"") is false (event2 does not happen).
- C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.
- C3 (""C2 holds and event2 happens"") is false.
- C4 (same as C1) is false.

4. Therefore C5 (C3 or C4) is false.

Final answer: False
---
Goal: determine whether C5 (C3 or C4) is True or False given the context.

Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- The hypothesis asks whether C5 is True. C5 = C3 ∨ C4.

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event1 happened (so at the initial moment, event1 has occurred).
- After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 ever occurs, it is followed by event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen (once event1 has occurred, no further events can occur afterwards).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" simply asserts that event2 happens. Given the redundancy, C1 is true exactly when event2 occurs at some point.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" means event2 occurs at some future time (i.e., eventually C1 is true) — equivalent to saying event2 occurs eventually.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens"" requires both that event2 occurs eventually and that event2 happens (i.e., event2 occurs) — effectively requires event2 to occur.
- C4: same as C1 — requires event2 happens.
- C5: C3 ∨ C4 — true if event2 occurs.

Step 4 — trace event sequences under the context
- Event1 has already happened initially.
- The rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" means that once event1 has occurred (and it already has), no further events (including event2) can occur at any later time.
- Therefore event2 cannot occur at any time.

Step 5 — conclusion
- Since event2 cannot occur, C1, C2, C3, and C4 are all false, so C5 (C3 ∨ C4) is false.

False"

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Context tells us that event1 happened initially, so in every execution/run event1 does occur (it occurs at the start). Thus the claim ""Event1 always happens"" (C1 and C2) is true as a global property of the system.

- C3 is the implication ""if event2 happens then C2 holds"". Since C2 is true, C3 is true (a true consequent makes the implication true regardless).

- C4 is ""C1 holds or C3 holds"". Both disjuncts are true, so C4 is true.

- C5 asserts ""C4 always holds"". Because C4 is true as a global fact (it follows from the already-true C1/C2), C5 is true.

Therefore C5 is True.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Context: event1 happened initially. After event1, event2 must happen, and after event2 nothing else can happen. So in every execution trace event1 occurs (initially) and then event2 occurs.

- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Given the context event1 occurs in every execution (it happens initially), so C1 is true. (C2 is the same as C1, so C2 is true.)

- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" Event2 does happen (it must after event1), and C2 is true, so the implication in C3 is true.

- C4: ""C1 holds or C3 holds."" Since C1 is true, C4 is true.

- C5: ""C4 always holds."" C4 is a global fact derived above, so C5 is true.

Therefore C5 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the question:
We must decide whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — restate the context and the Cs:
- Context: Initially event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, no other events can happen.
  So the only possible sequence is: event1 (initially) → event2 → end.
- C1: Event1 always happens.
- C2: Event1 always happens. (same as C1)
- C3: If event2 happens, then C2 holds.
- C4: C1 holds or C3 holds.
- C5: C4 always holds.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions:
- From the context, event1 does happen (it happens initially), so C1 (and C2) are true.
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" Event2 does happen in the only trace, and C2 is true, so the implication C3 is true.
- C4: C1 or C3 — since C1 is true, C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" C4 is true (a global fact), so C4 holds at all times/paths; therefore C5 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Reasoning (concise):
- Initially event1 has happened, and after event1 no further events can occur; therefore event2 cannot happen in the next state. So C1 is false.
- C2 is ""C1 and event1"" — false because C1 is false.
- C3 is ""C2 holds in the next state"" — false because no events (including event1) can occur after the initial state, so C2 cannot hold in the next state.
- C4 is ""event2 or C3"" — false (both disjuncts false).
- C5 is ""C4 and event2"" — false.

Answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- The hypothesis asks whether C5 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — recall the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has happened, no further events can occur in any later state).
- After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur after event1).

Step 3 — evaluate conditions in order:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Impossible, because event1 already happened and no other events can happen after event1. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" C2 is false, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""Event2 happens or C3 holds."" Both disjuncts are false, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 holds and event2 happens."" C4 is false, so C5 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
You are asking whether C5 is true given the context.

Context summary:
- At the initial state (call it state0) event1 happened.
- After event1 happens, no other events can happen in any later state.
- If event2 happens at some state, then event1 must happen after that.

Reasoning:
1. Because event1 happened at the initial state and after event1 no other events can happen, no event (including event2) can occur in any later state. So event2 never happens in any state.
2. C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" False (event2 never happens).
3. C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" False (C1 is false).
4. C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" False (C2 is false).
5. C4: ""Event2 happens or C3 holds."" False (both disjuncts false).
6. C5: ""C4 holds and event2 happens."" False (C4 is false and event2 does not happen).

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event2 has happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. So event1 will never occur in any future state.
- C1 (""Event1 eventually happens"") is therefore false in the initial state and in every state.
- C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false (since C1 is always false).
- C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true (negation of false).
- C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is false (negation of true), and it will remain false in all future states because C3 remains true.
- C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is false because C4 never becomes true.

Thus C5 is False.
---
Reasoning:

- From the context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. Thus event1 never happens (there is no time after the initial event2 when any event can occur).
- C1 = ""event1 eventually happens"" → False (event1 never happens).
- C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" → False (in the next state, still after event2, event1 will not eventually happen).
- C3 = ""C2 does not hold"" → True (since C2 is False).
- C4 = ""C3 does not hold"" → False (negation of True).
  - Note: C4 is logically equivalent to C2, so it is also False at all times.
- C5 = ""C4 eventually holds"" → False (C4 is never true, so it never eventually holds).

Final answer:
False
---
First identify the question: is C5 true or false?

Context summary: initially event2 has happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. So once we are at the initial state (where event2 happened) no further events occur; in particular event1 will never occur.

Evaluate the conditions:

- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" This is false: event1 cannot happen after the initial event2 and it did not happen before, so it never happens.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" C1 is false, and there are no further states in which C1 could become true, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This is the negation of C2, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Negation of C3, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" C4 is false now and will remain false (no events to change it), so C5 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Context: initially event1 happened (call that state S0). The context also says ""after event1, no other events can happen,"" so from S0 onward no events (in particular no event2) can ever occur.

- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a propositional tautology (event2 → event2), so C1 is True in every state.

- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is True, C2 is False.

- C3: ""Event2 happens and C2 holds."" C2 is False, so C3 is False (regardless of event2).

- C4: ""C3 holds or event2 happens."" This simplifies to just ""event2 happens"" (because C3 implies event2). But event2 never happens (by the context), so C4 is False in every state.

- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" The next state after S0 also has no events (so event2 is false there), hence C4 is false in the next state; therefore C5 is False.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must determine the truth of C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" Provide step-by-step reasoning about the context and each condition to decide if C5 is true.

Step 2 — understand the context (system behavior)
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has happened (which is the initial situation), there are no further events and no next-state with events.
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant here because event2 never occurs given the previous line).

Conclusion from context: event2 never happens (there is no next state after the initial state).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (A → A). It is true in every state regardless of whether event2 actually occurs. So C1 holds (True).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 holds, C2 is false.
- C3: ""Event2 happens and C2 holds."" Event2 does not happen (from context) and C2 is false, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event2 happens."" Both disjuncts are false, so C4 is false in the current state.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" There is no next state (no events after the initial state), so ""next C4"" is not satisfied. Under standard semantics (next is false when no successor), C5 is false.

Step 4 — final determination
- C5 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — context summary
- Initially, event1 has happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so there are no future states with new events).
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant because event2 does not occur).

Step 2 — evaluate conditions
- C1: (event2 → event2) is a tautology, so C1 holds (true).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" is the negation of a true statement, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""event2 happens and C2 holds"" is false (event2 does not occur and C2 is false).
- C4: ""C3 holds or event2 happens"" is false (both disjuncts false).
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" — there is no next state after the initial state (because event1 prevents any further events), and in standard next-state semantics Xφ is false at a terminal state. So C5 is false.

False"

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C4 is ""C2 holds and C3 holds"".
- C2 and C3 are both the same statement: ""C1 eventually holds"".
- C1 is ""Event1 does not happen.""

So C4 is true iff ""C1 eventually holds"" is true (because C2 and C3 are identical).

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 has already occurred at the start).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, the run has no further events).
- Also, ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur after the initial event1 (no events can happen after event1).

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and ""eventually C1""
- C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is false in this run because event1 already happened at the beginning.
- Because event1 has already occurred and nothing can happen after it, there is no future point where ""Event1 does not happen"" becomes true. Therefore ""C1 eventually holds"" is false.

Step 4 — conclude about C4
- C2 is false and C3 is false (they are the same statement).
- Hence C4 = (C2 and C3) is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C4 is the conjunction ""C2 holds and C3 holds"". Both C2 and C3 are the same statement: ""C1 eventually holds"".
- C1 is ""Event1 does not happen.""
So C4 is true exactly when ""event1 does not happen"" is true at some future time (and that holds for both C2 and C3, which are identical).

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially (time 0) event1 happened → at time 0, C1 is false.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" → once that initial event1 has occurred, there are no further events at later times; in particular, at the next moment there is no event1 occurring.
- The rule about event2 implying event1 is irrelevant because event2 cannot occur after the initial event1 (no other events can happen).

Step 3 — trace the sequence
- At time 1 (the next moment) no events occur, so ""event1 does not happen"" is true at that time. Thus C1 holds at some future time.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true. C3 is the same, so it is also true. Therefore C4 (C2 and C3) is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
C4 is the conjunction ""C2 holds and C3 holds"". We must decide whether C4 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — evaluate C1
C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" The context says ""Initially, event1 happened."" So C1 is false (event1 has happened).

Step 3 — evaluate C2 and C3
C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" C3: ""C1 eventually holds."" Both assert that at some future point C1 becomes true. Since event1 has already happened initially, ""event1 does not happen"" can never become true later. Also, ""after event1, no other events can happen,"" so nothing can change that fact. Therefore C2 is false and C3 is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C4
C4 = C2 ∧ C3, but both C2 and C3 are false, so C4 is false.

Answer: True

Brief justification (concise):

- Context forces Event1 to occur (initially), then Event2 must occur, and no events occur after Event2.
- C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is false because Event1 does happen.
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false because C1 is false.
- C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is therefore true.
- C4 (""Event1 happens or C3 holds"") is true (C3 is true).
- C3 is a true global fact here, so C4 holds at all times; hence C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true."

Sample responses:
You are asking whether C5 is true or false.

Step 1 — what is given:
- Initially, event1 happened. Therefore event1 did happen (at least initially).

Step 2 — examine each condition:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This contradicts the given initial event1, so C1 is false.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is false.
- C3: same as C1, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds."" Since C2 and C3 are both false, C4 is false.
- C5: ""C1 holds or C4 holds."" Both C1 and C4 are false, so their disjunction C5 is false.

Conclusion: C5 is False.

Step 1 — what’s asked:
- Determine whether C5 (C1 holds or C4 holds) is true or false.

Step 2 — examine conditions and context:
- Context: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 did occur.
- C1, C2, C3 each state ""Event1 does not happen."" Given the context, each of C1, C2, C3 is false.
- C4 is ""C2 holds and C3 holds."" Since C2 and C3 are false, C4 is false.
- C5 is ""C1 holds or C4 holds."" That is false OR false, which is false.

Conclusion:
False
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
C5 is ""C1 holds or C4 holds."" We must determine whether C5 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context and conditions
- Context says: initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true at the start.
- Also: after event1, no other events can happen. That prevents any later occurrence of event2.
- The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 cannot occur (it would have to occur after the initial event1, which is impossible).

Step 3 — evaluate the hypothesis clauses
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This contradicts the context (event1 did happen initially), so C1 is False.
- C2 and C3 are identical to C1, so C2 = False and C3 = False.
- C4 = C2 and C3 = False and False = False.
- C5 = C1 or C4 = False or False = False.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
C5 says: ""C4 holds in the next state."" We must decide whether that is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — interpret the context and conditions
- Context: initially (state0) event2 happened. After event2, event1 must happen (so state1 has event1). After event1, event2 must happen (so state2 has event2), and so on — an alternating sequence event2 (state0), event1 (state1), event2 (state2), ...
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" (evaluated relative to whatever current state we consider)
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" i.e. whenever event1 occurs at a state, event2 occurs in the next state.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" (there exists a future state where C2 is true)
- C4: ""C3 does not hold.""
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" (C4 is true at the next state)

Step 3 — evaluate from the initial state and the next state
- At state0: event2 happened, so C1 (event2 in the next state) is false at state0 because state1 has event1, not event2. C2 at state0 is the implication (if event1 then C1); since event1 does not hold at state0, C2 is vacuously true at state0. Hence C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true (already true at state0). Therefore C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is false at state0.
- C5 asks about the next state (state1). At state1, event1 happens, and by the context event2 happens in state2, so C1 holds at state1. Thus C2 holds at state1 (the implication is satisfied non-vacuously). So C3 also holds at state1. Therefore C4 is false at state1.

Step 4 — conclusion
C4 does not hold in the next state, so C5 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
We take ""now"" to be the initial state (call it s0). From the context:
- s0: event2 happened (given).
- The rules “after event2, event1 must happen” and “after event1, event2 must happen” force the events to alternate: s1 must have event1, s2 must have event2, s3 event1, etc.

Now evaluate the Ci at s0:

1. C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state (s1)."" False, because s1 must have event1 (not event2).
2. C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Interpreting C2 as the rule that after event1 event2 happens in the next state — that is exactly one of the given context rules, so C2 is true at s0 (and in fact at every state).
3. C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 already holds at s0, C3 is true.
4. C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This contradicts (3), so C4 is false at s0.
5. C5: ""C4 holds in the next state (s1)."" Since C4 is false at s0 and the underlying rules make C2 (hence C3) true at all states, C4 is also false at s1. Therefore C5 is false.

Conclusion: C5 is False.
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- From the context, the system alternates: initially event2, then event1, then event2, etc.
- C1 (""event2 happens in the next state"") is false at the initial state because the next state is event1.
- C2 (""if event1 happens, then C1 holds"") is true at every state:
  - At states where event1 does not occur the implication is vacuously true.
  - At states where event1 does occur, the context guarantees event2 in the next state, so C1 holds.
- Therefore C2 already holds now, so C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true (it holds immediately).
- C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is thus false.
- C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"") is false because C4 is false (it does not hold either now or in the next state).

Hence C5 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — set up the timeline
- Let s0 be the initial state. By the context, event2 holds in s0.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" means every state after a state with event2 has no events; so s1, s2, ... have no events.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions at s0 (current state)
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" — false, because s1 has no events.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" — true at s0 because event2 holds at s0 (the second disjunct).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — false, because at s1 neither C1 nor event2 holds, so C2 is false at s1.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" — true at s0, since C3 is false at s0.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" — we must check C4 at s1.

Step 3 — evaluate C4 at s1
- At s1, there are no events, so event2 is false at s1 and at all subsequent states.
- At s1, C2 is false (neither C1 nor event2 holds there), so C3 (C2 holds in the next state) is false at s1.
- Hence C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is true at s1.

Therefore C5 (C4 holds in the next state) is true at s0.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Let s0 be the initial state (event2 happened at s0). Let s1 be the next state, s2 the state after that, etc.
- From ""after event2, no other events can happen"" we take that once event2 occurs (at s0), no events occur in any future states (s1, s2, ...).

Now evaluate the conditions at s0 and needed future states:

- C1 (event2 happens in the next state = event2 at s1): false, because no events occur at s1.
- C2 (C1 holds or event2 happens at the current state): at s0 event2 happened, so C2 is true (false OR true = true).
- C3 (C2 holds in the next state = C2 at s1): at s1, there are no events, and C1 relative to s1 (event2 at s2) is false, so C2 at s1 is false. Thus C3 is false.
- C4 (C3 does not hold) at s0: C3 is false, so C4 is true.
- C5 (C4 holds in the next state = C4 at s1): evaluate C4 at s1. At s1, C3 (which would be ""C2 at s2"") is false for the same reasons, so C4 at s1 is true. Hence C5 is true.

Therefore C5 is True.
---
Step 1 — interpret the timeline
- Let state0 be the initial state. Event2 happened at state0.
- “After event2, no other events can happen” means for every state n>0 no events occur (in particular event2 does not occur in any state >0).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions at state0
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state” → asks if event2 occurs at state1. It does not, so C1 is false at state0.
- C2: “C1 holds or event2 happens” → at state0, event2 happens (at state0), so C2 is true at state0.
- C3: “C2 holds in the next state” → asks whether C2 is true at state1. At state1, event2 does not happen and C1 (about state2) is false, so C2 is false at state1. Thus C3 is false at state0.
- C4: “C3 does not hold” → since C3 is false at state0, C4 is true at state0.
- C5: “C4 holds in the next state” → we must check C4 at state1. At state1, C3 is “C2 holds in the next state” meaning C2 at state2; at state2 no events occur so C2 at state2 is false, hence C3 at state1 is false and C4 at state1 is true. Therefore C5 is true at state0.

Sample responses:
Task: decide whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") can be true, given the context and the conditions C1–C4.

Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C5 is True or False.

Step 2 — restate the background rules
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., as a consequence of event2, event1 is required before proceeding).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event1 and event2 must alternate).

Step 3 — inspect the conditions
- C1: event1 does not happen.
- C2: if C1 holds then event2 happens.
- C3: C2 holds and event2 happens.
- C4: C3 holds in the next state.
- C5: C4 always holds (i.e., in every state C3 holds in the next state).

Step 4 — trace and reason
- Because initially event2 occurred, the context requires that event1 must happen after that event2. So event1 must occur (at least once) following the initial event2.
- C1 asserts event1 does not happen. That contradicts the mandatory requirement that event1 must occur after the initial event2. Therefore C1 cannot hold in the actual execution consistent with the context.
- C2 and C3 depend on C1 holding (C2 is conditional on C1; C3 asserts both C2 and event2 happen). But since C1 is incompatible with the context, C2 and C3 cannot be reliably established as holding in the runs required by the context.
- In particular, C3 (which asserts event2 happens while C1 holds) would imply consecutive event2s without the required intervening event1, contradicting the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen.""
- Thus C4 (C3 in the next state) cannot be guaranteed, and therefore C5 (""always C4"") cannot hold.

Conclusion
- C5 is False.
---
Step 1 — model the timeline
- Let t0 be the initial state. By the context, at t0 event2 happens.
- From the context: after any state where event2 happens, event1 must happen next; after any state where event1 happens, event2 must happen next. So the events alternate:
  t0: event2, t1: event1, t2: event2, t3: event1, ...

Step 2 — interpret the conditions as state formulas with ""next"" and ""always""
(standard temporal reading)
- C1: ""event1 does not happen"" — at a given state.
- C2: ""if C1 holds, then event2 happens"" — a conditional evaluated at the same state.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens"" — at the same state.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — next-time applied to C3.
- C5: ""C4 always holds"" — globally for every state.

Step 3 — evaluate at the initial state t0
- t0: event2 happens, event1 does not. So C1 is true at t0.
- Because C1 is true and event2 happens at t0, C2 is true at t0 (the implication’s antecedent holds and the consequent holds).
- Hence C3 is true at t0 (C2 holds and event2 happens).
- C4 at t0 requires that C3 holds at t1. But at t1 event1 happens and event2 does not, so C3 is false at t1 (the ""event2 happens"" part of C3 fails). Therefore C4 is false at t0.
- Since C4 is already false at t0, it cannot be that C4 always holds; C5 is false.

Final answer: False
---
We ask whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true.

1) Interpret the background:
- At time 0 (initially) event2 happens.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" → event1 at time 1.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" → event2 at time 2.
So events alternate: event2 at t=0,2,4,... and event1 at t=1,3,5,...

2) Evaluate the conditions at times:
- At t=0: event2 happens, event1 does not happen. So
  - C1 (event1 does not happen) is true at t=0.
  - C2 (""if C1 then event2"") is true at t=0 because the antecedent C1 is true and event2 is true.
  - C3 (C2 holds and event2 happens) is true at t=0.
  - C4 says ""C3 holds in the next state"" — i.e. C3 at t=1. Check t=1:
    - At t=1, event1 happens, so C1 is false at t=1.
    - C2 at t=1 (""if C1 then event2"") is vacuously true (antecedent false).
    - But event2 does NOT happen at t=1, so C3 (C2 and event2) is false at t=1.
  - Therefore C4 is false at t=0.

3) Since C4 is already false at t=0, ""C4 always holds"" (C5) is false.

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- The question asks whether C5 (""If C4 holds, then event1 happens."") is true given the context.

- Context: initially event2 has occurred (time 0). Rules: after event2, event1 must occur; after event1, event2 must occur. So the timeline is an alternating sequence: event2 at time 0, event1 at time 1, event2 at time 2, event1 at time 3, ….

- Evaluate the conditions at the initial state (time 0):
  - C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True (it already happened at time 0, and will again).
  - C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" True (C1 holds and event1 occurs at time 1).
  - C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" True (there are multiple event1 occurrences in the alternating sequence).
  - C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" True (at time 1, C3 is true).
  - C5: ""If C4 holds, then event1 happens."" At time 0 the antecedent (C4) is true, but event1 does not happen at time 0 — it happens at the next state (time 1). Thus the implication, taken at the current state, is false.

Therefore C5 is False.
---

---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the context we get an alternating sequence: event2 occurred initially, and after any event2 an event1 must occur, and after any event1 an event2 must occur. So event2 and event1 alternate; event1 does occur (immediately after the initial event2).
- C4 means: ""C3 holds in the next state.""
- C3 is ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" So if C3 holds in that next state, then in that next state event1 happens.
- Therefore, whenever C4 is true (i.e., C3 holds in the next state), event1 happens (in that next state). Hence the implication in C5 is true."

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Context: initially event2 happened. Also, after event2 no other events can happen. Therefore no events occur after that initial event2.
- That means event1 does not happen at any time (it cannot happen after the initial event2, and there is no earlier time).
- C1 and C4 both assert that event1 happens (twice), so C1 and C4 are false.
- C2 = C1 and event2, so C2 is false (C1 is false).
- C3 = eventually C2, so C3 is false (C2 is never true).
- C5 = C3 and C4, so C5 is false because both conjuncts are false.

Thus C5 is False.

The hypothesis asks whether C5 is true.

Step-by-step:

- From the context: initially event2 happened. Also, after event2 no other events can happen. Therefore no events (including event1) can occur at any later time.
- C1 = ""event1 happens and event1 happens"" — this requires event1 to happen. Given the context, event1 does not (and cannot) happen, so C1 is false.
- C2 = C1 holds and event2 happens — C1 is false, so C2 is false (even though event2 did happen).
- C3 = ""C2 eventually holds"" — C2 is false now and cannot become true later (no further events can occur), so C3 is false.
- C4 is the same as C1, so C4 is false.
- C5 = C3 holds and C4 holds — both are false, so C5 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- The hypothesis asks whether C5 is true, where
  - C1: event1 happens and event1 happens (i.e. event1 happens),
  - C2: C1 holds and event2 happens,
  - C3: C2 eventually holds,
  - C4: event1 happens and event1 happens (same as C1),
  - C5: C3 holds and C4 holds.

Step 2 — use the context:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. (So once event2 has occurred, no event1 can occur later.)
- Also (redundantly) after event1 no other events can happen.

Step 3 — reason through each condition:
- Because event2 happened initially and no further events can occur after event2, event1 does not (and cannot) happen at any time. Therefore C1 (event1 happens) is false.
- C2 requires C1 and event2; since C1 is false, C2 is false (even though event2 did happen).
- C3 is “C2 eventually holds”; C2 is false and no future events can make it true, so C3 is false.
- C4 is the same as C1, so C4 is false.
- C5 requires both C3 and C4; both are false, so C5 is false.

Goal: determine whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is True or False.

Step 1 — identify the statements
- C1: Event1 always happens.
- C2: Event1 always happens. (same as C1)
- C3: If C1 holds, then C2 holds. (If P then P)
- C4: C3 does not hold.
- C5: C4 always holds.

Step 2 — evaluate C3
- C1 and C2 are the same proposition (call it P). C3 is ""If P then P"", which is a tautology — it always holds regardless of whether P itself is true. So C3 holds.

Step 3 — evaluate C4
- C4 asserts that C3 does not hold. Since C3 does hold, C4 is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C5
- C5 asserts that C4 always holds. But C4 is false, so it does not (always) hold. Therefore C5 is false.

The context about event sequencing does not change the logical status of the implication ""If P then P"", so the above reasoning stands.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
You’re asked whether C5 is true or false given the context and the listed conditions.

Step 2 — interpret the context
The context enforces that event1 happens initially, event2 must follow event1, and event2 is terminal. That makes event1 occur (at least initially) in every allowed execution.

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Given the context (event1 happens initially in all executions), C1 is true.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Since C1 and C2 are both true (and even identical), the implication C1 ⇒ C2 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" But C3 does hold, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" Since C4 is false, C5 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
You’re asked whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is True or False.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" From the context, event1 happens initially, not necessarily always — so C1 is not true in general.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is also not true in general.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" This is logically true: either C1 is false (making the implication vacuously true) or, if C1 were true, C2 is the same statement so the implication holds. Thus C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is true, C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" Since C4 is false, C5 is false.

Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has occurred, there are no successor states with further events).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 would also be terminal).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" Given the context we only know event2 happened initially; no place for event1 to happen later because after event2 no further events can occur. So C1 is false.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — since C2 is false, C3 is true.
- C4: ""C1 holds and C3 holds"" — this requires C1 true and C3 true. C1 is false, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" — there is no next state after the initial state (after event2 no further events/states), and in any case C4 is false in the current and any possible successor. Therefore C5 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

- Context: initially event2 happened; and after event2 (or after event1) no other events can happen. So once event2 has occurred there can be no further occurrences of event1 or anything else.

- C1 and C2 both assert ""event1 happens and event2 happens"" (they are the same statement).

- C3 asserts that C2 does not hold (C3 = not C2). Thus C2 and C3 are contradictory.

- C4 is ""C1 holds and C3 holds"", i.e. C2 and not C2 — logically impossible, so C4 is false in every state.

- C5 says ""C4 holds in the next state"". Since C4 can never be true, C5 cannot be true.

Therefore C5 is False.
---
First: the hypothesis asks whether C5 is true.

Examine the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" Call this P.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 = P.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" = not P.
- C4: ""C1 holds and C3 holds"" = P and not P, which is a contradiction (always false).
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" — requires C4 to be true (in some next state).

From the context:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So event1 cannot happen at any later point.
Therefore P (""event1 and event2"") is false (event1 does not happen). So C1 and C2 are false, C3 is true, C4 = false, and thus C5 is false.

Sample responses:
First, what is being asked:
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is True or False given the context.

Examine the context and each condition:
- Context: initially event2 happened (so at the initial state s0 event2 is true). After event2, event1 must happen (so at the state immediately after any event2, event1 must occur). After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 occurs, no events occur in any later state).
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" — this asserts event2 at s1.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens"" — since event2 already happened at s0, C2 is true only if event2 also happens at s1 (i.e., event2 at both s0 and s1).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — ¬C2.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" — at some (possibly current) time ¬C2 holds.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" — ¬(eventually ¬C2).

Trace the required event sequence:
- Because event2 occurred at s0, the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" forces event1 at s1.
- But if event1 happens at s1, then ""no other events can happen"" after s1, and in particular event2 cannot occur at s1.
- Therefore C1 (event2 at s1) is false. Hence C2 is false, so C3 (¬C2) is true — already true at the initial state.
- Since C3 is true now, ""C3 eventually holds"" (C4) is true.
- Therefore C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — understand the setup:
- Initially event2 happened.
- Immediately after event2, event1 must happen (so the next state after the initial one is event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions in order:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Given the rule, the next state after the initial event2 must be event1, not event2. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" C2 is false, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 already holds now, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" C4 is true, so C5 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 has occurred.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so the next event after that initial event2 is event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 2 — evaluate conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Given that after the initial event2 the next event must be event1, event2 cannot happen in the next state. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" C2 is false, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 already holds immediately, so it certainly eventually holds. Thus C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" C4 is true, so C5 is false.

False

Reasoning summary (step-by-step):

- Initially event2 has happened, so C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is true at the start.
- The system forces: after event2, event1 must happen; after event1 no further events can happen. Thus event1 will occur at some future time and then no events will occur afterwards.
- After event1 occurs, from those later states event2 will not happen in the future, so C1 is false from that point onward. Therefore C1 is not always true, so C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.
- C3 (""C2 holds and event2 happens"") is false because C2 is false. Hence C4 (""C3 always holds"") is false as well.
- C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is therefore false (C4 never becomes true).

So C5 is False."

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. The question asks whether C5 (""Event1 happens and C4 holds"") is true given the context.

2. From the context: initially event2 happened. Also, after event2 no other events can happen. (Separately, after event1 no other events can happen.)

3. Because event2 has already happened initially and it prevents any subsequent events, event1 cannot occur at any time (it cannot have occurred before the initial state, and it cannot occur after event2).

4. C5 requires ""Event1 happens"" as a conjunct. Since event1 cannot happen under the given context, that conjunct is false. A conjunction is false if any conjunct is false, so C5 is false regardless of the truth of C4.

Therefore C5 is False.
---
You ask whether C5 (""Event1 happens and C4 holds"") is True or False.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Context says initially event2 happened.
- Also, after event2, no other events can happen. Since event2 happened initially, no further events can ever occur.
- That rules out event1 happening at any time (it cannot happen before the initial state, and cannot happen after).
- C5 requires event1 to happen (and also C4 to hold). Because event1 does not happen, the conjunction in C5 is false regardless of C4.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""Event1 happens and C4 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — facts from the context
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 occurs at the start).
- After event2, no other events can happen. Therefore once event2 has occurred, event1 cannot occur afterward.
- Also: after event1 no other events can happen (not needed here since event1 never occurs).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: “Event2 always happens.” Even if event2 happened initially, the context does not allow any further events after that moment, so there is no way for event1 to occur later; in any reasonable reading C1 is not needed to make the conclusion. (Whether C1 is true or false doesn’t matter for the final conjunction.)
- C2 and C3 are stronger “always” statements about C1 and C2; their truth values are irrelevant because:
- C4: “If C3 holds, then event2 happens.” If C3 is false, C4 is vacuously true; if C3 were true, event2 already happens (it did initially). So C4 holds.
- The key part of C5 is the conjunct “Event1 happens.” But since event2 happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, event1 cannot happen at any time.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C4 holds, but “Event1 happens” is false. Therefore the conjunction C5 is false.

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Simplify the clauses:
   - C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" simplifies to ""Event1 happens"".
   - C2 similarly simplifies to ""Event1 happens"".
   - C3 = C1 and C2, so C3 is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"".
   - C4: ""C3 always holds"" says that C3 (i.e., Event1 happens) holds at all times.
   - C5: ""C4 holds or event1 happens"" is ""(C3 always holds) or (Event1 happens)"".

2. Use the context:
   - Initially event2 happened, and the rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"" means no event (including event1) can happen after that initial event2.
   - Therefore Event1 does not happen at any time.

3. Evaluate the conditions:
   - Since Event1 never happens, C1 and C2 are false, so C3 is false.
   - C3 is false, so ""C3 always holds"" (C4) is false.
   - Both disjuncts of C5 are false (C4 false, Event1 does not happen), so C5 is false.

Therefore C5 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Context: initially event2 occurred. The rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"" means no occurrence of event1 is possible at any later time (and since event2 already happened initially, there is no time left for event1 to occur).
- Therefore ""Event1 happens"" is false. Both C1 and C2 (each being ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"") are false.
- C3 = C1 and C2 is false.
- C4 = ""C3 always holds"" is false because C3 is false (so it cannot hold always).
- C5 = C4 holds or event1 happens = false or false = false.

So C5 is False.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C5 is ""C4 holds or event1 happens."" We must decide whether that disjunction is true given the context.

Step 2 — simplify the conditions
- C1 and C2 are both ""event1 happens or event1 happens"", so each is equivalent to ""event1 happens"".
- C3 = C1 and C2 = ""event1 happens"" AND ""event1 happens"" = ""event1 happens"".
- C4 = ""C3 always holds"" = ""event1 always holds"" (i.e., event1 holds at all times).

So C5 = (event1 always holds) OR (event1 happens).

Step 3 — use the context
- Context states: initially event2 happened. After event2, no other events can happen. Therefore, once event2 has happened (which is the initial fact), no event1 can occur after that initial point.
- The context gives no reason to conclude that event1 happens at any time (neither before nor after); in fact, because event2 has already happened and no events can happen after it, there is no occurrence of event1 after the initial point.
- Thus ""event1 happens"" is not supported (false), and ""event1 always holds"" is also false.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Both disjuncts of C5 are false, so C5 is False.

We are asked whether C5 is true or false given the context and the other conditions.

Step 1 — what is asked
- C5 is ""C4 does not hold."" We must determine whether that statement is true or false under the given context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 is true).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will eventually happen; C1 is true).
- After event1, no other events can happen (no further events, but that doesn't prevent event1 itself).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True (follows from event2 → event1).
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" Since C1 is true (and event1 does happen), C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" False (because C2 is true).
- C4: ""Event2 happens or C3 holds."" Event2 does happen, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" False (because C4 is true).

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — interpret context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → event1 will occur sometime after the initial event2.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Step 2 — evaluate conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True (follows from event2 happened and the rule that after event2 event1 must happen).
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" True (event1 does happen, and C1 also holds).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" False (because C2 holds).
- C4: ""Event2 happens or C3 holds."" True (event2 did happen initially, so C4 holds regardless of C3).
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" False (since C4 holds).

We are asked whether C5 (""C3 holds and C4 holds"") is true given the context.

Step-by-step evaluation (concise, not internal chain-of-thought):
- Context: event1 happened initially. So ""event1 happens"" is true. (Also both events are terminal, but that doesn't affect the immediate facts below.)
- C1 (""event1 happens or event2 happens""): True (because event1 happened).
- C2 (""If event1 happens, then C1 holds""): True (the antecedent is true and the consequent C1 is true, so the implication holds).
- C3 (""C2 does not hold""): False (it contradicts the fact that C2 holds).
- C4 (same as C1): True.
- C5 (""C3 holds and C4 holds""): requires C3 true and C4 true; since C3 is false, C5 is false.

Final answer:
False

Step 1 — what’s asked:
We must decide whether C5 (""C3 holds and C4 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — facts from the context:

- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Antecedent (event1) is true and consequent (C1) is true, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" But C2 does hold, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" Same as C1, so C4 is true.

Step-by-step reasoning

1. Understand the context:
- Initially event2 has happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- If event1 happens then event2 must happen afterwards.

Because event2 has already happened initially and no events can happen after event2, event1 cannot occur.

2. Evaluate each condition given that context:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" This is false (event1 cannot happen).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" As a material implication this is true: either C1 is false (it is) making the implication vacuously true; moreover event2 did happen anyway.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This asserts C2 is false — but C2 is true, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This asserts C3 is false — that is true, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" This asserts C4 is false — but C4 is true, so C5 is false.

Therefore C5 is False.
---
Step 1 — what’s asked:
We must decide whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is True or False given the context and the chain of conditions.

Step 2 — use the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" This conflicts with the context: because event2 already happened and no events can happen after it, event1 cannot always occur. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Event2 does in fact happen (initially), so the implication is true (the consequent is true), hence C2 holds.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" But C2 does hold, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is false, C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" But C4 is true, so C5 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must determine the truth value of C5 given the context and the chain C1–C5.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so no events occur after that initial event2).
- After event1, event2 must happen (i.e., if event1 occurs, event2 must occur afterward).
From this, event1 cannot occur (there is no time after the initial event2 for any event1 to occur, and there are no events before the initial event2).

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" This is false (event1 does not and cannot occur).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" As a material implication: the antecedent C1 is false, so the implication is true; also independently event2 does happen (initially), so C2 holds true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" But C2 does hold, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is false, C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" C4 is true, so C5 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked
You ask whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is True or False given the event constraints.

Step 2 — event timeline from the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → event2 does occur at some point.
- After event2, no other events can happen → the sequence is event1 then event2, then end.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" Plainly equivalent to ""event2 happens."" Since event2 does happen, C1 is true.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" This is trivially true (if event2 then event2), and given event2 does happen the implication’s consequent holds, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 already holds, so ""eventually C2"" is satisfied — C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 already holds, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" But we found C4 does hold, so C5 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — interpret the conditions
- From the context: initially event1 occurs. After event1, event2 must occur (so event2 does occur sometime). After event2, no further events can occur (event2 is terminal).
- Interpret C1 as the conjunction ""event2 happens and event2 happens"" — this is just a redundant repetition and is equivalent to the single proposition ""event2 happens.""

Step 2 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""event2 happens"" — True, because event2 must happen after event1.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Since C1 is equivalent to ""event2 happens,"" this implication is true (whenever event2 happens, C1 holds).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 already holds from the start (it is true in the trace), so C3 is True.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Since C3 is true already, C4 is True.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 holds, C5 is False.

Final answer: False

(Note: if one instead read C1 as requiring two distinct occurrences of event2, the answer would differ. Under the natural reading of the repeated conjunction as redundant, the correct final answer is False.)
---
Summary answer: C5 is False.

Brief justification:
- From the context, event2 does happen (it must follow event1).
- C1 is equivalent to ""event2 happens"" and so is true.
- C2 (""if event2 then C1"") is therefore true.
- C3 (""eventually C2"") and C4 (""eventually C3"") are true as well.
- C5 asserts ""C4 does not hold"", which contradicts the above, so C5 is false."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We want to evaluate C5 (""C4 does not hold"") given the event rules.

Step-by-step:

- Let s0 be the initial state. At s0 event2 happened (given).
- Rule: after event2, event1 must happen. So s1 (the next state) has event1.
- Rule: after event1, event2 must happen. So s2 has event2, and the pattern alternates thereafter.

Now evaluate the conditions:

- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" At s0 event2 has already happened, so C1 is true.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds."" Since both C1 and C2 are true, C3 is true at s0.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" At s1 (the next state) event1 has happened and, by the rules, event2 will happen later, so from s1 event2 eventually happens. Thus C1 (and C2) are true at s1, so C3 is true at s1. Therefore C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is true, C5 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C5 says ""C4 does not hold."" We must decide whether that statement is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- Context: initially event2 happened; after event2, event1 must happen; after event1, event2 must happen. This enforces an alternating sequence event2, event1, event2, ...
- C1 and C2: both assert ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given the context, event2 occurs initially and then recurs, so C1 and C2 are true.
- C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds."" Since C1 and C2 are true, C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" In the next state (after the initial event2, there will be event1 and then event2 again), event2 will still eventually happen, so C3 is true in the next state. Therefore C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is true, C5 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — understand the scenario
- Initially (at time 0) event2 happens.
- After any event2, event1 must happen (so event1 occurs at the next step after an event2).
- After any event1, event2 must happen (so event2 occurs at the next step after an event1).
Thus the system produces an alternating sequence: event2 at t0, event1 at t1, event2 at t2, event1 at t3, … So event2 occurs at t0, t2, t4, … (infinitely often).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given event2 occurs at t0 (and repeatedly later), C1 is true at the initial state (and in every state there is a future event2).
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is also true.
- C3: ""C1 holds or C2 holds."" That is true (both hold).
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" Because C3 is true in every state (event2 recurs), C3 is true in the next state, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" This is the negation of C4; since C4 is true, C5 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true given the context.
- Provide step-by-step reasoning and then a final answer of either ""True"" or ""False"".

Step 2 — interpret the context and the conditions
- Context:
  1. Initially, event1 happened.
  2. After event1, no other events can happen (i.e., the system is terminal after the initial state; there are no further states with events).
  3. After event2, event1 must happen (this is irrelevant if event2 never occurs).
- Conditions:
  - C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" (i.e., in the immediate successor state).
  - C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (there exists some future state where C1 is true).
  - C3: ""C2 eventually holds"".
  - C4: ""C3 eventually holds"".
  - C5: ""C4 always holds"" (C4 must be true in every state along the execution).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions given the context
- Because the initial state already has event1 and after event1 no other events can happen, there are no successor states with any events. Therefore event2 cannot occur in any next state.
- C1 is false in the initial state (there is no next state where event2 happens).
- C2 = ""eventually C1"" is false because C1 never becomes true at any future point (there are no future points where event2 occurs).
- By the same reasoning, C3 and C4 (which are nested ""eventually"" of false statements) are also false in the initial state.
- C5 requires that C4 hold in every state; since C4 is false in the initial state, C5 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Goal: is C5 (""C4 always holds"") true?

Context summary:
- Initially event1 has happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so from the initial state onward, no events occur).
- Also: if event2 happens then event1 must happen afterwards (irrelevant here because no events can occur after the initial event1).

Evaluate the chain:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Since after the initial event1 no events can happen, event2 does not happen in the next state. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" C1 never becomes true (event2 never happens), so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 is never true, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 is never true, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" For C5 to be true, C4 must be true now (and at all times); but C4 is false, so C5 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — understand the setup
- Initially (in the initial state) event1 has happened.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — since event1 has already happened initially, no events (including event2) can occur in any future state.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here for enabling event2, it only imposes that any occurrence of event2 must be followed by an occurrence of event1.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Given the rule that no events can happen after the initial event1, event2 cannot happen in the next state. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" That requires event2 to occur at some future point (so that at some state C1 is true). But event2 can never occur (blocked by the initial event1), so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 is false and can never become true, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Same reasoning, C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" C4 is false (not holding now or ever), so it certainly does not always hold.

C5 is False."

We must evaluate whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true given the context.

---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- “After event2, no other events can happen” means once event2 has occurred (and it has, initially), no further events (including event1) can ever occur.
- “After event1, no other events can happen” is irrelevant here because event1 never occurs given the previous point.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1 and C2: “If event1 happens, then event2 happens.” Since event1 never happens in any reachable timeline (because event2 has already happened and prevents any later events), these implications are vacuously true.
- C3: “C2 holds and event1 happens.” C2 holds, but event1 does not happen, so C3 is false.
- C4: “C1 holds and C3 holds.” C1 holds but C3 is false, so C4 is false.
- C5: “C4 always holds.” C4 is false (so it does not hold), therefore C5 is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Context gives that initially event2 happened, and that after event2 no other events can happen. So event1 does not occur at any time (there is no time after the initial event2 when event1 could happen).
- C1 and C2 are conditionals ""if event1 happens then event2 happens"". Because event1 never happens in this scenario, those implications are vacuously true.
- C3 requires both C2 to hold and event1 to happen. Even though C2 holds, event1 does not happen, so C3 is false.
- C4 requires C1 and C3; since C3 is false, C4 is false.

Votes: {'True': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
First identify what’s being asked:
- We must decide whether C5 (“C4 eventually holds”) is True or False given the context and the C1–C5 definitions.

Interpretation (standard temporal reading):
- “Initially, event1 happened.” Means event1 holds at time 0.
- “After event2, event1 must happen.” Means whenever event2 occurs, event1 will occur afterward (event2 ⇒ eventually event1).
- “After event1, event2 must happen.” Means whenever event1 occurs, event2 will occur afterward (event1 ⇒ eventually event2).
- C1–C5 are statements about the occurrence of these events; read C1 as “event2 happens and event1 happens” (i.e., both events do occur, possibly at different times).

Step-by-step examination:
1. C1: Both events happen.
   - True. event1 has already happened initially. By the rule “after event1, event2 must happen,” event2 will happen later. So both events occur (indeed infinitely often by the mutual requirement).

2. C2: If event1 happens, then C1 holds.
   - True. If event1 happens at any time, the rule “after event1, event2 must happen” guarantees event2 will happen later, and event1 has happened, so the conjunction “event2 happens and event1 happens” is satisfied. Thus whenever event1 occurs, C1 becomes true (now or eventually).

3. C3: C2 always holds.
   - True. The implication in C2 follows from the system’s rules at every time; the dependency is invariant, so C2 is globally true.

4. C4: C3 always holds.
   - True. If C3 holds at every time, then stating that “C3 always holds” is itself invariant; C4 holds at every time.

5. C5: C4 eventually holds.
   - True. If C4 holds always (i.e., at all times), then in particular there exists some future time at which C4 holds — so C4 holds eventually.

Conclusion:
C5 is True.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Initially event1 happened (given).
2. After event1, event2 must happen (given), so because event1 did happen, event2 will happen at some future point. Thus both event1 and event2 occur in the run — C1 holds.
3. C2 says: if event1 happens then C1 holds. Whenever event1 happens, by the requirement ""after event1, event2 must happen"" we get that event2 will also occur, and since event1 did happen, C1 holds. So C2 holds.
4. C3 says C2 always holds. The implication in C2 follows from the system rules at every time, so C2 holds at all times; hence C3 holds.
5. C4 says C3 always holds. Since C3 already holds at all times, C4 holds.
6. C5 says C4 eventually holds. Because C4 holds immediately and at all times, it certainly holds at some future point — so C5 is true.
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
C5 is the statement “C4 eventually holds.” You ask whether C5 is True or False given the context and the chain of conditions C1–C4.

Step 2 — restate the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1 happens, event2 must happen.
- After event2 happens, event1 must happen.

From these rules we get an alternating (infinite) sequence of occurrences: event1 (initially), then event2, then event1, then event2, … so both events occur (in fact infinitely often).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: “Event2 happens and event1 happens.” Given the alternating sequence, C1 is true (both events do occur).
- C2: “If event1 happens, then C1 holds.” If event1 happens at any time, by the rules event2 will happen after it, and event1 already did happen, so C1 is true. Thus C2 holds whenever evaluated.
- C3: “C2 always holds.” Since C2 is true at every point (the implication is guaranteed by the rules), C3 is true.
- C4: “C3 always holds.” If C3 holds at every time, then saying it “always holds” is also true, so C4 holds.
- C5: “C4 eventually holds.” If C4 holds at all times (including now), then in particular there is some time in the future at which C4 holds — so “eventually C4” is true.

Step 4 — conclusion
C5 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""If C3 holds, then C4 holds"") is true or false under the given context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 does occur.
- “After event1, no other events can happen.” Thus no event can occur later than that initial event1.
- Therefore event2 cannot occur (it can't be after event1, and nothing could be before the initial moment), so event2 does not happen.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens"" → false (event2 does not happen).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" → true (since C1 is false).
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens"" → true (C2 is true, so the disjunction is true).
- C4: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens"" → false (same as C1).
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds"" → this is an implication: true antecedent (C3) and false consequent (C4) makes the implication false.

Final answer
False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C5 (""If C3 holds, then C4 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true at the start.
- After event2, event1 must happen (whenever event2 occurs, event1 must occur later).
- After event1, no other events can happen (once event1 has occurred, no events can occur later).

Step 3 — reason about which events can occur
- Since event1 already happened initially, no events can occur after that point.
- Therefore event2 cannot occur at any time (it cannot occur before the initial event1, and it cannot occur after it).
- Conclusion: event1 happens (true), event2 does not happen (false).

Step 4 — evaluate C1–C4
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens"" → False (event2 does not happen).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" → True (negation of False).
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens"" → True (both disjuncts are true).
- C4: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens"" → False (same as C1).

Step 5 — evaluate C5
- C5 is the implication C3 → C4. Here C3 is True and C4 is False, so the implication is false.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Context implies event1 happens initially, and once event1 has happened no other events can occur. So event1 is true and event2 cannot happen (false).
- C1 (event1 and event2) is therefore false.
- C2 (not C1) is true.
- C3 (C2 or event1) is true (in fact both disjuncts are true).
- C4 (event1 and event2) is the same as C1, so false.

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Context implies strict alternation: initial state has event2. The rules ""after event2, event1 must happen"" and ""after event1, event2 must happen"" force the sequence …, event2 (initial), event1, event2, event1, … So the next state after the initial state has event1, not event2.

- Evaluate the conditions at the initial state:
  - C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" This is false (next state has event1).
  - C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false in the initial state, C2 is false.
  - C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" Both disjuncts are false in the initial state (C2 is false; the current state has event2, not event1), so C3 is false.
  - C4: same as C1, so false.
  - C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" Both C3 and C4 are false, so C5 is false.

Therefore C5 is False.
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C5 is true given the context and the listed conditions.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e., at every state, event2 happens in the next state).
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens"" (either C2 is true, or event1 holds now).
- C4: same as C1.
- C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds.""

Step 3 — use the context to trace events
- Initially, event2 happened (call that state 0).
- Rule: after event2, event1 must happen → state1 has event1.
- Rule: after event1, event2 must happen → state2 has event2.
- So the sequence is event2 (state0), event1 (state1), event2 (state2), event1 (state3), ... — they alternate.

Step 4 — evaluate conditions at the initial state
- C1 (event2 in the next state): false, because the next state (state1) has event1.
- C4 is identical to C1: false.
- C2 (always C1): false (C1 is already false now, so it cannot hold always).
- C3 (C2 or event1): C2 is false and event1 does not hold at the initial state, so C3 is false.
- C5 (C3 or C4): false or false = false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- S0 (initial state): event2 happened.
- Rules: after event2, the next state must have event1; after event1, the next state must have event2.
  So the states alternate: S0 has event2, S1 must have event1, S2 must have event2, etc.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions at the initial state S0
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" — false, because S1 must have event1 (not event2).
- C4 is the same as C1 — false.
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — false (C1 is already false at S0).
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens"" — false (C2 false and event1 does not happen in S0).
- C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds"" — false (both C3 and C4 are false).

C5 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We must decide whether C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true given the context.

1) Understand the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so nothing can change after the initial moment).
- (Also: after event2 no other events can happen, but event2 cannot occur because event1 already happened and blocks further events.)

2) Interpret the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — equivalent to ""Event1 happens"".
- C2: same as C1 — ""Event1 happens"".
- Since event1 happened initially, C1 and C2 are true.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" With C1 true and C2 true, C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is true, C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" That would require C4 to become true at some later time.

3) Trace events / temporal behavior:
- No events can occur after event1, so truth values of these propositions cannot change after the initial moment.
- C4 is false now and can never become true.

Conclusion: C5 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. The question asks whether C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true or false.

2. From the context: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So the fact ""event1 happens"" is true at the start. Also ""After event1, no other events can happen,"" so no future events can change facts after that initial moment.

3. C1 is ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — this is just the same statement duplicated, so C1 is true because event1 did happen. C2 is the same as C1, so C2 is also true.

4. C3 is ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Given C1 and C2 are both true, C3 is true (in fact it is a tautologically satisfied implication here).

5. C4 is ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 does hold, C4 is false.

6. C5 is ""C4 eventually holds."" Because no events can occur after the initial event1, nothing can change C4 from false to true; C4 will never hold. Therefore C5 is false.

Thus the correct final answer is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. From the context, event1 has happened initially. Also “after event1, no other events can happen,” so once event1 has happened the system is terminal (no further events can occur).
2. C1 and C2 both state “Event1 happens” (they are identical). Since event1 happened initially, C1 and C2 hold.
3. C3 is “If C1 holds, then C2 holds.” Given C1 and C2 are true, the implication C3 is true.
4. C4 is “C3 does not hold.” That is false because C3 does hold.
5. C5 is “C4 eventually holds” (i.e., at some future point C3 becomes false). But no further events can occur after event1, so there is no way for truth values to change to make C3 false later. Therefore C4 never becomes true, so C5 is false."

Sample responses:
We evaluate all Ci at the initial state s0. Let s0 be the initial state (event2 holds there). By the given rules the states alternate: s0: event2, s1: event1, s2: event2, s3: event1, …

- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" At s0 the next state is s1 and event1 holds there → C1 is True at s0.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" This asks about the current state (s0): event1 does not happen in s0 (s0 has event2), so C2 is False at s0 (even though C1 is True).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" At s1, C2 would require event1 at s1 (true) AND C1 at s1 (i.e. event1 at s2). But s2 has event2, so C1 at s1 is False, hence C2 is False at s1. Therefore C3 is False at s0.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is False at s0, C4 is True at s0.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is True at s0, C5 is False at s0.

Final answer: False

You are asking whether C5 is true given the alternating-event constraint. I'll evaluate the Ci formulas step by step from the initial state S0 (where event2 has just happened).

Interpretation: ""in the next state"" means the usual next-state temporal operator X. The dynamics enforce alternation: S0: event2; S1: event1 (because after event2, event1 must happen); S2: event2 (after event1, event2 must happen); and so on.

Evaluate at S0:

- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" = X(event1). At S0 this is true because S1 has event1.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds"" = event1 ∧ C1 (both evaluated in the same state). At S0 event1 does not happen (S0 had event2), so C2 is false at S0.
  (For clarity: at S1, event1 happens but C1 at S1 would be false because S2 has event2, so C2 is also false at S1.)
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" = X(C2). This asks whether C2 is true at S1; we just noted C2 is false at S1, so C3 is false at S0.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" = ¬C3. Since C3 is false at S0, C4 is true at S0.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" = ¬C4. Since C4 is true at S0, C5 is false at S0.

Therefore C5 is False. Final answer: False
---
We evaluate each condition at the initial state (state0). The timeline forced by the context is:
state0: event2 occurred (initial).
state1: event1 (since after event2, event1 must happen).
state2: event2 (since after event1, event2 must happen).
…and so on, alternating.

Now evaluate the Ci at state0:

- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" At state1 event1 does happen → C1 is True.

- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Interpreting ""Event1 happens"" as in the current state (state0): at state0 event2 happened, not event1, so that conjunct is false. Even if one tried to read it differently, the required alternation prevents event1 from occurring both now and next. Therefore C2 is False at state0.

- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" At state1 we just noted C2 is False, so C3 is False at state0.

- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is False, ""C3 does not hold"" is True → C4 is True.

- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" But C4 is True, so ""C4 does not hold"" is False.

Sample responses:
You ask whether C5 is True or False.

Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Since event1 happened initially, no events can ever happen after that.
- After event2, event1 must happen — irrelevant because event2 can never occur (see above).

Step 2 — evaluate each condition:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Given event1 occurred initially and prevents any later events, event2 indeed does not happen → C1 is True.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" C1 is true immediately (and at all times), so C2 is True.
- C3: ""Event2 does not happen."" Same as C1 → C3 is True.
- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds."" Both true → C4 is True.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" But C4 does hold, so C5 is False.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):
1. Initially event1 happened, and the context says after event1 no other events can happen. So event2 can never occur.
2. Therefore C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is true.
3. C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true because C1 already holds now (hence it holds at some future point as well).
4. C3 is the same as C1, so it is true.
5. C4 (""C2 holds and C3 holds"") is true (both conjuncts true).
6. C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is therefore false.
---
Step 1 — what is asked
You are asked whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 has happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen → once event1 has happened (which is already the case), no events (including event2) can ever occur thereafter.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 can never occur (see previous line).

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" True, because event1 already happened and no other events can happen after it.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 is already true from the start, C1 does indeed hold (hence it ""eventually holds""). So C2 is true.
- C3: ""Event2 does not happen."" Same as C1, so true.
- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds."" Both are true, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" This contradicts the result that C4 is true, so C5 is false.

Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C5 is true or false. C5 = C1 holds and C4 holds.

Step 2 — understand the background
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, no further events can occur).
- After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 occurs, event1 must occur afterward).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: Event2 always happens. Given the background, event1 already happened initially and no events can happen after event1, so event2 cannot occur after that. Nothing could occur before ""initially,"" so event2 cannot occur at all. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2: Same as C1 (also false).
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" Event1 does happen, but C2 is false, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""Event2 happens and C3 holds."" Event2 does not happen (false) and C3 is false, so C4 is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C5
- C5 = C1 holds and C4 holds. Both C1 and C4 are false, so C5 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
We must decide whether C5 is true or false under the given context.

Step 2 — restate the background constraints
- Initially, event1 happened. (So at the start of the scenario event1 has already occurred.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (Event1 is terminal: once event1 has occurred, no further events can occur.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs, then event1 must occur afterward.)

Step 3 — examine the conditions in the hypothesis
- C1: Event2 always happens. (i.e. event2 occurs.)
- C2: Event2 always happens. (duplicate of C1)
- C3: Event1 happens and C2 holds. (requires event1 and event2)
- C4: Event2 happens and C3 holds. (requires event2 and event1 and event2)
- C5: C1 holds and C4 holds. (requires event2 and the conjunction in C4)

Step 4 — reason about what can actually occur
Because event1 has already happened initially and no events can happen after event1, event2 cannot occur at any time after the initial moment. There is no earlier time before the initial state when event2 could occur (the initial state already includes event1). Therefore event2 does not happen.

Step 5 — evaluate the conditions
- C1 and C2 (event2 happens) are false.
- C3 requires C2, so C3 is false (even though event1 is true, C2 is false).
- C4 requires event2 and C3, so C4 is false.
- C5 requires C1 and C4, so C5 is false.

- After event2, no other events can happen.

Evaluate conditions in order:

1. C1: ""Event2 always happens.""  
   Given that event1 happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, event2 cannot occur at any later time. There is no way for event2 to ever hold. Thus C1 is false.

2. C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds.""  
   Event1 does happen (initially), but C1 is false, so C2 is false.

3. C3: ""C2 holds in the next state.""  
   Since C2 is false, C3 is false.

4. C4: ""Event2 happens and C3 holds.""  
   C3 is false (and event2 never happens), so C4 is false.

5. C5: ""C4 eventually holds.""

- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false because at the initial state event1 happened and, by ""after event1 no other events can happen,"" event2 cannot occur thereafter. So there is a state (the initial one) where event2 does not happen.
- C2 (""Event1 happens and C1 holds"") is false because C1 is false (even though event1 does happen).
- C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is false (C2 is false, and no further events can make it true).
- C4 (""Event2 happens and C3 holds"") is false (event2 does not happen, and C3 is false).
- C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") therefore cannot be true because C4 never holds.

Final answer: False
---
Reasoning:

- Context: Initially event1 happened. Also, after event1 no other events can happen (and similarly after event2 no other events can happen). Because event1 has already happened initially and it forbids any further events, event2 can never occur in any future state.

- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" This is false — event2 never happens (it cannot occur after the initial event1).

- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Event1 does happen, but C1 is false, so C2 is false.

- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Since C2 is false now and there can be no event that would make it true later (no events can occur after event1), C3 is false.

- C4: ""Event2 happens and C3 holds."" Event2 does not happen and C3 is false, so C4 is false.

- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" Because C4 can never become true (event2 cannot occur), C5 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Interpret states: let s0 be the initial state, s1 the next state, s2 the state after that.
- From the context:
  - s0: event2 happens (initially event2).
  - s1: event1 happens (after event2, event1 must happen).
  - s2: no events happen (after event1 no other events can happen).

Evaluate the conditions at s0:
- C1: ""event2 happens in the next state"" — asks whether event2 occurs in s1. No (s1 has event1), so C1 is false at s0.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — asks whether C1 is true in s1, i.e., whether event2 happens in s2. No, s2 has no events, so C2 is false at s0.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens"" — event2 happens in s0, so C3 is true at s0.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event2 happens"" — since C3 is true, C4 is true at s0.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" — asks whether C4 is true in s1. Evaluate C4 in s1:
  - In s1, event2 does not happen.
  - C3 in s1 is ""C2 holds in s1 or event2 happens in s1"": event2 does not happen in s1, and C2 in s1 would require event2 in s2 (false). So C3 is false in s1.
  - Therefore C4 is false in s1.

Thus C5 is false at s0. Final answer: False.
---
Reasoning:

- Let s0 be the initial state (event2 happened). By the rules:
  - s1 (the next state) must have event1.
  - After event1 no further events occur, so s2 and beyond have no events.

- Evaluate the conditions at s0:

  C1: ""event2 happens in the next state (s1)"". False — s1 has event1, not event2.

  C2: ""C1 holds in the next state (i.e., at s1)"". At s1, C1 would assert event2 in s2; s2 has no events, so C1 is false at s1. Therefore C2 is false at s0.

  C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens (at s0)"". C2 is false, but event2 does happen at s0, so C3 is true at s0.

  C4: ""C3 holds or event2 happens (at s0)"". C3 is true (and event2 is true), so C4 is true at s0.

  C5: ""C4 holds in the next state (i.e., at s1)"". At s1, event2 does not occur and we already saw C2 is false there, so C3 is false at s1 and thus C4 is false at s1. Hence C5 is false at s0.

Final answer:
False
---
You ask whether C5 is true given the context. Evaluate step by step on the timeline of states:

Context interpreted as a linear sequence of states:
- s0 (initial): event2 happened.
- s1 (next): because event2 happened at s0, event1 must happen at s1.
- s2 (after event1): after event1 no further events can happen, so no events at s2 or later.

Definitions (at a state s):
- C1(s): event2 happens in the next state (event2 at s+1).
- C2(s): C1 holds in the next state (C1 at s+1).
- C3(s): C2(s) or event2(s).
- C4(s): C3(s) or event2(s).
- C5(s): C4 holds in the next state (C4 at s+1).

Evaluate at s0:
- event2(s0) = True (given).
- event2(s1) = False (s1 has event1).
- event2(s2) = False (no events after s1).

Compute:
- C1(s0) = event2(s1) = False.
- C2(s0) = C1(s1) = event2(s2) = False.
- C3(s0) = C2(s0) or event2(s0) = False or True = True.
- C4(s0) = C3(s0) or event2(s0) = True or True = True.
- C4(s1) (needed for C5(s0)) = C3(s1) or event2(s1).
  - C3(s1) = C2(s1) or event2(s1) = C1(s2) or False = event2(s3) or False = False.
  - So C4(s1) = False or False = False.
- Therefore C5(s0) = C4(s1) = False.

Final answer: False."

Step 1 — what’s asked
We must decide whether C5 (""If event1 happens, then C4 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 occurred.
- After any event1, event2 must occur.
- After any event2, event1 must occur.
So starting from the initial event1, events alternate indefinitely: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

Step 3 — evaluate C1–C4
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" False — because at times when event2 occurs event1 is not occurring, so event1 does not hold at all times.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" True (since C1 is false).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" True — C2 is a global fact (C1 is false), so it holds in all states.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens."" The antecedent C3 holds, and event2 does occur in the alternating sequence, so C4 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C5
C5 is ""If event1 happens, then C4 holds."" C4 holds globally (independent of event1), so the implication is true whenever evaluated. Therefore C5 is true.

Final answer:
True"

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen; after event1, event2 must happen.
- So the system produces an infinite alternating sequence: event2, event1, event2, event1, ... . Both event1 and event2 occur infinitely often.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautological implication (p → p), so C1 holds.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is a tautology, it holds at every point, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" If C2 holds always, it certainly holds eventually, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" But C3 does hold, so C4 is false (it never holds).
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" Since C4 is false at all times, C4 does not eventually hold; therefore C5 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the claim
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true or false given the chain C1..C5 and the event context.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a logical tautology (p → p); it is true in every state.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is a tautology, it indeed holds at every time; so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" If C2 holds at all times, then in particular it holds at some future time, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This contradicts the previous line: C3 is true, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" Since C4 is false (it never holds), C5 is false.

Step 3 — conclusion
- C5 is False.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true or false given the chain C1–C5 and the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (A → A). It is always true regardless of the event schedule.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is a tautology, it indeed holds at all times, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" If C2 holds always, then in particular it holds at some time, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" But we just concluded C3 does hold, so C4 is false (it never holds).
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" Since C4 is false at all times, it never holds, so C5 is false.

(The initial-event context and alternating requirements do not change these logical tautologies and negations.)

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what's being asked
- We must determine whether C5 (""Event2 happens and C4 holds"") is true or false given the context and the chain of conditions.

Step 2 — interpret the context rules
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true at the start.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" implies that because event1 happened initially, event2 will (at some point) occur.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" implies events alternate: whenever event1 occurs it is followed by event2, and whenever event2 occurs it is followed by event1.

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This contradicts the given initial fact that event1 happened, so C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false (event1 did happen), C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Because C2 is false and cannot become true (it claimed always no event1, which is already violated), C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is false, C4 is true.
- Event2: Because event1 happened initially and the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" applies, event2 does happen.

Step 4 — conclude about C5
- C5 requires both ""Event2 happens"" (true) and ""C4 holds"" (true). Both parts are true, so C5 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- The hypothesis asks whether C5 is true, where C5 is ""Event2 happens and C4 holds.""

Step 2 — interpret each condition
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" (i.e., event1 never occurs).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" = event1 never happens at any time.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" = eventually (from some time onward) event1 never happens.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" = it is not the case that eventually event1 never happens (i.e., there is no suffix of the timeline with no event1).
- C5: ""Event2 happens and C4 holds.""

Step 3 — use the context to evaluate them
- Context: initially event1 happened. So C1 (event1 never happens) is false right away.
- Context: after event1, event2 must happen. Since event1 did happen initially, event2 must happen (so event2 does occur).
- Context: after event2, event1 must happen, and after event1, event2 must happen — this enforces that event1 and event2 keep occurring (in particular, event1 occurs again and again), so there is never a time after which event1 never occurs. Therefore C2 never becomes true, and C3 (""eventually C2"") is false.
- Since C3 is false, C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is true.
- We already established event2 does happen, so both parts of C5 are true.

Final answer
True
---
What is being asked
- Decide whether C5 (""Event2 happens and C4 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Examine the context and trace events
- Initially event1 happened.
- Rule1: After event2, event1 must happen.
- Rule2: After event1, event2 must happen.
- From the initial event1 and Rule2, event2 must (and thus does) happen after that initial event1.
- From that event2 and Rule1, event1 must happen again, and so on. So the two rules force an indefinite alternation: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

Evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" False, because event1 did happen initially (and occurs repeatedly).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" False, because C1 is already false at the start.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" False: there is never a time from which C1 holds always (event1 continues to occur), so C2 never becomes true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" True, because C3 is false.
- Event2 happens: True, as shown above (occurs right after the initial event1 and repeatedly).

C5 is ""Event2 happens and C4 holds."" Both conjuncts are true, so C5 is true.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event1 happened, and the rules say after event1 no other events can happen. So event2 cannot happen at any future point.
- C1 (""Event2 eventually happens"") is therefore false.
- C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true (since C1 is false).
- C3 (""Event2 happens and C2 holds"") is false because Event2 does not happen (the conjunction is false).
- C4 (""C3 always holds"") is false because C3 is already false.
- C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"") is false because C4 is false (so it does not hold in the next state).

Hence C5 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Context: initially event1 has happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. So event2 cannot happen at any future point.
- C1 (“event2 eventually happens”) is therefore false.
- C2 (“C1 does not hold”) is true.
- C3 (“event2 happens and C2 holds”) is false because event2 does not happen (false ∧ true = false).
- C4 (“C3 always holds”) is false because C3 is already false now (and remains false).
- C5 (“C4 holds in the next state”) is false: there is either no next state (so X-operator is false) or any next state still has C4 false. 

Thus C5 is false.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event1 has happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. So once started, no further events (including event2) can ever occur.
- C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is therefore false.
- C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.
- C3 (""event2 happens and C2 holds"") is a contradiction (requires event2 both to happen and not eventually happen), so C3 is false.
- C4 (""C3 always holds"") is false because C3 is already false in the initial state (and hence cannot be true in all states).
- C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"") is false: regardless of whether a next state exists, C4 is false in every state, so it certainly does not hold in the next state.

Therefore C5 is False."

Sample responses:
Identify what is asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is True or False given the context and the chain of conditions C1–C5.

Examine the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
Thus event1 does in fact happen (initially), and the events alternate thereafter. In particular, at least one of event1 or event2 happens.

Evaluate conditions step by step
1. C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens.""  
   - True, because event1 happened initially.

2. C2: ""C1 does not hold.""  
   - False, since C1 is true.

3. C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" (C2 → event1)  
   - An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C3 is True (vacuously true).

4. C4: ""C3 does not hold.""  
   - False, because C3 is true.

5. C5: ""C4 always holds.""  
   - C4 is false now, so C4 does not hold (and thus it is not true that C4 always holds). Therefore C5 is False.

Final answer
False
---
Goal: determine whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is True or False.

Step-by-step:
- From the context: event1 happens initially, and then event2 must happen after event1, and event1 must happen after event2. So event1 (and event2) do occur. In particular, ""event1 happens or event2 happens"" (C1) is true.
- C2 asserts ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is true, C2 is false.
- C3 is ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C3 is true.
- C4 is ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is true, C4 is false.
- C5 is ""C4 always holds."" C4 is false, so C5 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true or false, given the context and the listed conditions C1–C4.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- From the context: event1 initially happened, and events alternate thereafter. So at least one of event1 or event2 happens. Therefore C1 (""Event1 happens or event2 happens"") is true.
- C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" — since C1 is true, C2 is false.
- C3 is ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" An implication with a false antecedent (C2 is false) is true, so C3 is true (vacuously).
- C4 is ""C3 does not hold"" — since C3 is true, C4 is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C5
- C5 asserts ""C4 always holds."" But C4 is false, so C4 does not hold, and hence C5 is false.

Final answer:
False"

Sample responses:
Answering: C5 is False.

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. What is being asked: whether C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"") is true.

2. Use the context to fix the model of time/states:
   - Initially event1 happened (so in the initial state event1 is true).
   - After event1 no other events can happen, and after event2 no other events can happen. In particular, because event1 happened initially, there is no next state (the system terminates after the initial state).

3. Evaluate the conditions in the initial state:
   - C1: ""event1 happens and event2 happens."" event1 is true, but event2 cannot happen after event1 (and there is no prior time to place it), so C1 is false.
   - C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" This is false or true = true.
   - C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" C2 is true and event1 is true, so the implication is true (C3 holds).
   - C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 holds, C4 is false.

4. C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" There is no next state (since event1 terminated the system), so C4 cannot hold in a next state. Therefore C5 is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Step-by-step reasoning

1. From the context: initially event1 happened. Also, after event1 no other events can happen. Therefore no state follows the initial state (the initial state is terminal), and event2 cannot occur at any time after the initial moment.

2. C1 (event1 and event2) is false because event2 does not occur.

3. C2 (C1 or event1) is true because event1 is true.

4. C3 (if C2 then event1) is true: C2 holds and event1 holds, so the implication is satisfied.

5. C4 (C3 does not hold) is false, since C3 does hold.

6. C5 (C4 holds in the next state) is false because there is no next state (after event1 no further states/events are possible). In standard temporal semantics, a ""next"" formula is false when no next state exists. Even if one tried to posit a next state, C4 is false in every reachable state, so C4 cannot hold there.

Therefore C5 is False.
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
- C5 = ""C4 holds in the next state"". We must decide whether C4 is true in the next state.

Step 2 — evaluate the initial state (given: initially event1 happened; after event1 no other events can happen)
- event1: true
- event2: false (cannot occur after event1)
- C1 = event1 ∧ event2 = false
- C2 = C1 ∨ event1 = true
- C3 = (C2 → event1) = true → true = true
- C4 = ¬C3 = false

Step 3 — evaluate the next state (no further events can occur after event1, so in the next state neither event1 nor event2 holds)
- event1: false
- event2: false
- C1 = false
- C2 = false ∨ false = false
- C3 = (C2 → event1) = false → false = true (implication with false antecedent is true)
- C4 = ¬C3 = false

Step 1 — what’s given:
- Initially event1 happened (so event1 is true).
- “After event1 no other events can happen” (irrelevant here).
- “After event2 no other events can happen” (irrelevant here).

Step 2 — evaluate each condition:
- C1: (event1 → event1). This is a tautology, so C1 holds.
- C2: (event1 → event1). Same as C1, so C2 holds.
- C3: (event1 → C2). The antecedent (event1) is true, and C2 holds, so C3 holds.
- C4: C1 ∧ C3. Both C1 and C3 hold, so C4 holds.
- C5: ¬C4. Since C4 holds, C5 is false.

Final answer: False

We are given that event1 happened initially, and after event1 no other events can happen.

Step 1 — identify the goal
- C5 asserts ""C4 does not hold."" We must decide whether C5 is true or false.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is trivially true (a tautological implication). Given event1 did happen, C1 holds.
- C2: identical to C1, so C2 also holds.
- C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" Event1 does happen and C2 is true, so C3 holds.
- C4: ""C1 holds and C3 holds."" Since both C1 and C3 hold, C4 holds.

Step 3 — evaluate C5
- C5 says C4 does not hold. But we just established C4 does hold, so C5 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (material implication p→p); it holds.
- C2: Same as C1, so it also holds.
- C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" Since C2 is true (independent of whether event1 actually happens), the implication in C3 is true.
- C4: ""C1 holds and C3 holds."" Both C1 and C3 are true, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" This is the negation of C4; since C4 is true, C5 is false.

Step 3 — consider the context
- The facts about events (event1 happened and no other events can happen afterward) do not invalidate the logical tautologies above and do not change the truth-values derived.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""Event2 happens and C4 holds"") is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened (so event1 has already occurred).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur at some later time).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur again after event2).
Thus the events alternate and both event1 and event2 do in fact occur (event1 already did; event2 must follow).

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True (it already happened initially).
- C2: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True (same as C1).
- C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" C2 is true, so C3 is true (disjunction true).
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" C1 is true and C3 is true, so the implication C4 is true.
- C5: ""Event2 happens and C4 holds."" From the context event2 does happen, and we have established C4 is true, so C5 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must determine whether C5 (""Event2 happens and C4 holds"") is true given the context and the definitions C1–C4.

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
Thus event1 and event2 occur (and alternate) — both occur (at least once, and indeed repeatedly).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True (it happened initially).
- C2: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Same as C1, so True.
- C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" Since event2 does happen (by the context), C3 is True (even if C2 is also True).
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" C1 is True and C3 is True, so the implication C4 is True.
- C5: ""Event2 happens and C4 holds."" Both conjuncts are True (event2 happens; C4 is True), so C5 is True.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur following that initial event1).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so they alternate indefinitely).

Step 2 — evaluate each condition:
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True (it already happened initially).
- C2: same as C1, so True.
- Event2 happens (because it must happen after the initial event1), so ""Event2 happens"" is True.
- C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" True (both disjuncts are true, in any case the disjunction is true).
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" Since C1 is true and C3 is true, the implication C4 is True.

Step 3 — evaluate C5:
- C5: ""Event2 happens and C4 holds."" Both conjuncts are True, so C5 is True.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Context: initially event2 happened. Also, after event2 no other events can happen. (The ""after event1 no other events can happen"" clause is irrelevant because event1 does not occur initially and cannot occur after event2.)

2. C1: ""Event1 always happens"" — This is false because event1 did not happen initially (event2 did) and cannot happen later (no events after event2).

3. C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — This says that at some future point, event1 will from then on always hold. That cannot happen because after event2 nothing else can happen, so C1 cannot become true at any future point. So C2 is false.

4. C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — Since C2 is false (and cannot become true in the future), C3 is false.

5. C4 and C5: Each requires the previous one to hold in the next state; since C3 is false, C4 is false, and therefore C5 is false.

Therefore C5 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify formulas
- C1 = ""Event1 always happens"" (i.e., G event1).
- C2 = ""Eventually C1 holds"" (F G event1).
- C3 = X C2, C4 = X C3, C5 = X C4 (so C5 = X X X (F G event1)).

Step 2 — use the context
- Initially event2 happened, so at the initial state event1 does not hold.
- After event2, no other events can happen (the system is a dead-end). Also after event1 nothing else can happen, but that is irrelevant because event1 did not occur initially.

Step 3 — evaluate
- C1 is false in the initial state (event1 does not always happen).
- Because no events can occur after the initial event2, there is no future point where ""event1 always holds"" can become true. So C2 (F G event1) is false.
- If C2 is false, then X C2, X X C2, etc. are all false as well. Therefore C3, C4, and C5 are false.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event2 happened and the problem states that after event2 no other events can happen. So the system is in a terminal state where event1 does not hold and no future states/events occur.
- C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false because event1 did not occur in the initial (and only) state.
- C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false because there are no future states in which C1 could start to hold.
- C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is false because there is no next state.
- C4 and C5 (further next-state claims) are likewise false.

Therefore C5 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context as facts about which events occur:
- Initially event1 happened → event1 is true.
- After event1, event2 must happen → event2 is true.
- After event2, no other events can happen → no further events to change these facts.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1: event1 or event2. Since both event1 and event2 are true, C1 is true.
- C2: event2 or C1. Since event2 (and C1) is true, C2 is true.
- C3: not C2. Since C2 is true, C3 is false.
- C4: C3 or event1. C3 is false but event1 is true, so C4 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C5: ""C4 always holds.""
- Given the context, event1 has happened and nothing can occur later to invalidate the truth of C4. Thus C4 holds (and cannot cease to hold), so C5 is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
You ask whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is true or false, given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred (which is already true initially), nothing else can ever occur afterward — in particular event2 cannot occur after that point.
- (The extra sentence ""After event2, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never gets a chance to occur once event1 has happened.)

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Given event1 happened initially and no events can occur after event1, event2 cannot happen at any time. So C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Since C1 is true (event2 never happens), it remains true in the next state as well. So C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 already holds now (and hence at some future point), so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" Both disjuncts are true (event1 did happen initially, and C3 is true), so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 holds, C5 is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event1 has happened. Also ""after event1, no other events can happen,"" so the run is terminal immediately after that initial state.
- C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is true because no further events (including event2) can occur.
- C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false because there is no next state (so ""next"" cannot hold).
- C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is false: C2 is currently false and there are no future states in which it could become true.
- C4 (""C3 holds or event1 happens"") is true because event1 has happened.
- C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is therefore false.
---
We are asked whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is true or false.

Step 1 — understand the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has occurred, event2 cannot occur afterward.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Not relevant since event2 never occurs here.)

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Given event1 happened initially and no further events can occur after that, event2 never happens. So C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" C1 is globally true (event2 never happens), so it certainly holds in the next state. C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 already holds (now and in the next state), C3 (that C2 holds at some future point) is true.

Sample responses:
Step-by-step:

1. From the context: initially event1 has happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. Therefore event2 cannot ever happen (there is no time after the initial event1 when event2 could occur). The ""after event2, event1 must happen"" clause is irrelevant because event2 never occurs.

2. C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" — False (event2 cannot happen).

3. C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" — This is equivalent to ""event2 happens"" (since C1 is the same statement), so C2 is False.

4. C3: ""C2 does not hold."" — True (since C2 is False).

5. C4: ""C3 does not hold."" — False (since C3 is True).

6. C5: ""Event2 happens or C4 holds."" — Both disjuncts are False (event2 does not happen; C4 is False), so C5 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means once event1 has happened (and it has, initially), no further events (including event2) can ever occur afterwards.
- Therefore event2 cannot occur at any time.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given the context, event2 cannot occur, so C1 is False.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" Both disjuncts are false (event2 does not happen, and C1 is False), so C2 is False.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is False, C3 is True.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" C3 is True, so C4 is False.
- C5: ""Event2 happens or C4 holds."" Both are false (event2 does not happen, C4 is False), so C5 is False.

Final answer:
False

Identify the goal
- We must decide whether C5 (""Event2 happens or C4 holds"") is true given the context.

Examine the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has happened (and it has, initially), event2 cannot happen at any time.
- After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant because event2 never happens here).

Evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" — False, because event1 happened initially and prevents any other events (including event2).
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" — False, since both disjuncts are false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" — True, because C2 is false.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" — False, because C3 is true.
- C5: ""Event2 happens or C4 holds."" — Both disjuncts are false (event2 does not happen, C4 is false), so C5 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C5 (""Event2 happens and C4 holds"") is true given the context and the listed conditions C1–C4.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (p -> p), so C1 holds in every state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Since C1 holds in every state, it certainly holds in the next state, so C2 is true in every state.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Because C2 holds right now (indeed everywhere), C3 is true (it holds immediately, so it holds eventually).
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This contradicts C3, so C4 is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C5
- C5 is the conjunction ""Event2 happens and C4 holds."" The context gives that event2 happens initially, so the first conjunct is true, but C4 is false. A conjunction with a false conjunct is false.

Final answer:
False

Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must determine whether C5 (""Event2 happens and C4 holds"") is true or false given the context and the chain of conditions C1–C5.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p), so C1 is true in every state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Since C1 is true in every state, it also holds in the next state; so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Because C2 holds now (and in every state), it certainly holds at some future time, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This is the negation of C3; since C3 is true, C4 is false.
- C5: ""Event2 happens and C4 holds."" This conjunct requires C4 to be true; but C4 is false, so C5 is false regardless of whether event2 happens.

Conclusion
- C5 is False.

Step 1 — What is being asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""Event2 happens and C4 holds"") is true or false under the given context.

Step 2 — Understand each condition
- Context: initially event2 occurs, and the system enforces that after event1 occurs, event2 must occur; and after event2 occurs, event1 must occur. (This implies the system will alternate event1 and event2, but that detail won't change the tautology reasoning below.)
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (P → P) and is true in any state where the formula is evaluated.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Since C1 is true in every state, C1 is also true in the next state, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 already holds now (hence eventually), so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This is the negation of C3; since C3 is true, C4 is false.

False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Context: Initially event2 happened. After event2, no other events can happen. After event1, event2 must happen.
- From ""initially event2 happened"" and ""after event2 no other events can happen"" we infer event2 occurred and event1 did not occur (there is no time before that initial event in which event1 could occur).
- Evaluate the conditions:
  - C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens"" — False (event1 does not happen).
  - C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens"" — equivalent to ""event1 happens"" here, so False.
  - C3: same as C1 — False.
  - C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds"" — False (both conjuncts false).
  - C5: ""C4 always holds"" — False, because C4 does not hold in the actual situation.
- Therefore C5 is False.
---
Step-by-step:

1. Write the conditions in propositional form:
   - C1 = event1 ∧ event2.
   - C2 = C1 ∨ event1 = (event1 ∧ event2) ∨ event1 = event1.
   - C3 = event1 ∧ event2 (same as C1).
   - C4 = C2 ∧ C3 = event1 ∧ (event1 ∧ event2) = event1 ∧ event2 (so C4 = C1).
   - C5 = ""C4 always holds"" (i.e. C4 is true in the actual execution).

2. Use the background facts:
   - Initially, event2 happened.
   - After event2 no other events can happen → no event can occur after that initial event2.
   - After event1, event2 must happen (a constraint that only applies if event1 occurs).

3. Is event1 true in the actual execution? Given event2 happens initially and no events can happen after it, there is no opportunity for event1 to occur (it cannot occur after event2, and there is no prior occurrence). Thus event1 does not occur.

4. Therefore C4 = event1 ∧ event2 is false (event1 is false, event2 true). Hence C4 does not hold, so C5 (""C4 always holds"") is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
- C5 asserts that C4 always holds. We must decide if C5 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — restate the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.

Step 3 — unpack the conditions
- C1 = (event1 happens) AND (event2 happens).
- C2 = C1 OR (event1 happens).
- C3 = (event1 happens) AND (event2 happens). (same as C1)
- C4 = C2 AND C3.
- C5 = always(C4).

Step 4 — evaluate against the context
- Since event2 happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, event1 cannot occur at any time (it cannot occur after the initial event2, and it did not occur before because event2 is stated to have happened initially).
- Therefore (event1 happens) is false in the actual execution.
- C1 and C3 require event1 to hold, so C1 = C3 = false.
- C2 = C1 OR event1 = false OR false = false.
- C4 = C2 AND C3 = false AND false = false.
- C4 does not hold (at the initial state), so ""always(C4)"" is false.

Final answer:

---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C5 is the claim ""C4 always holds"" (and C4 is ""C3 always holds"", etc.). The question: given the context, is C5 true?

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred there are no further events).
- Also: after event2, event1 must happen (if event2 ever occurs then event1 must occur afterward).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — this just asserts that event2 happens. Given the context, is event2 possible? No: event1 happened initially and forbids any subsequent events, so event2 cannot occur after that initial event. There is no earlier time where event2 could have happened (we are given the initial condition only). Therefore C1 is false.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds"" — also requires event2; false for the same reason.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — requires that at some future time C2 becomes true. Since C2 never holds, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — requires C3 to be true at every time; C3 is false, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 always holds"" — likewise false.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C5 is False.

Final answer: False

Goal: decide whether C5 is true.

Given facts:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has happened, the run is terminal — no future event can occur.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (This is irrelevant if event2 never occurs; it would be a vacuous implication.)

From the first two facts: event1 has already happened initially, and therefore no event can happen afterwards. In particular, event2 never happens at any future time.

Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 happens"" (stated twice) — false, because event2 never happens.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds"" — false (requires event2).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — false (C2 never holds).
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — false (C3 is false now and never becomes true).
- C5: ""C4 always holds"" — false.

Therefore C5 is False. Final answer:

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
The question asks whether C5 is true given the background facts.

Step 2 — simplify the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" ≡ Event2 happens.
- C2: same as C1 ≡ Event2 happens.
- C3: C1 and C2 ≡ Event2 happens.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" ≡ Eventually, Event2 happens.
- C5: C4 holds and Event2 happens ≡ (Eventually Event2) and (Event2 happens) — which is equivalent to Event2 happens.

So C5 is true exactly when Event2 happens at some time.

Step 3 — use the background facts
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Since event1 has already happened initially, no events can occur after that point — in particular, Event2 cannot occur at any time after the initial event1.
- The other background rule (""After event2, event1 must happen"") does not enable Event2 to occur (it only constrains what must follow if Event2 happens).

Therefore Event2 cannot happen.

Conclusion
C5 is False.
---
Step 1 — what is asked
The question asks whether C5 is true given the context and the definitions C1–C5. So we must determine if C5 holds.

Step 2 — restate the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so no events occur at any time after the initial moment).
- Also: after event2, event1 must happen (this is irrelevant if event2 never occurs).

Step 3 — unpack the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — equivalent to ""event2 happens"" (conjunction of the same fact).
- C2: same as C1 → also ""event2 happens"".
- C3: C1 and C2 → equivalent to ""event2 happens"" (both require event2).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" → there is some future time at which C3 (i.e., event2) holds.
- C5: ""C4 holds and event2 happens"" → requires (a) event2 happens at least once in the future (C4) and (b) event2 happens (now or at some time).

Step 4 — reason about possible event sequences
Because event1 has happened initially and no events can happen after that, event2 cannot occur at any time (neither now nor later). Therefore every formula that requires ""event2 happens"" is false. The extra rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" does not enable event2; it only constrains what would follow if event2 occurred.

Step 5 — evaluate C1–C5
- C1 is false (event2 does not happen).
- C2 is false.
- C3 is false.
- C4 is false (C3 never becomes true).
- C5 is false (requires event2, which cannot occur).

Final answer
False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C5 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — restate the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has happened, the system has no further events).
- After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 occurs then event1 must occur after it).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This simply asserts that event2 happens (redundant copy).
- C2: same as C1, also asserts event2 happens.
- C3: C1 holds and C2 holds — equivalent to asserting event2 happens.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" — asserts that at some point C3 (i.e. event2 happens) will be true.
- C5: C4 holds and event2 happens — requires that eventually event2 happens (C4) and that event2 happens now/as well.

Step 4 — trace possibilities given the context
- Because event1 happened initially, the rule ""after event1 no other events can happen"" prevents any further events at any time. That blocks event2 from ever occurring.
- Therefore event2 does not happen, so C1, C2, and C3 are false, and C4 (""eventually C3"") is false.
- Since C4 is false and event2 never happens, C5 is false.

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. What is asked: C5 asserts ""C4 does not hold."" So we must decide whether C4 is false (making C5 true) or C4 is true (making C5 false).

2. Interpret the conditions:
   - Initially (state S0): event2 happened.
   - After event2, no other events can happen (so in S1,S2,... no events occur).
   - C1: event1 or event2 (a local disjunction).
   - C2: if event1 then C1. This is always true in any state: whenever event1 is true, C1 is also true (since C1 contains event1), and if event1 is false the implication is vacuously true.
   - C3: C2 holds in the next state.
   - C4: event2 happens (in the current state) and C3 holds.

3. Evaluate at the initial state S0:
   - event2 happened at S0, so ""event2 happens"" is true.
   - In S1 (the next state), no events occur, so event1 is false there. As noted, C2 (""if event1 then C1"") is true in S1 (vacuously). Therefore C2 holds in S1, so C3 is true in S0.
   - Thus both conjuncts of C4 are true in S0, so C4 holds.

4. Therefore C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is false.
---
Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- C1 is the proposition ""event1 or event2"".
- C2 is ""if event1 then C1"". Since C1 is (event1 ∨ event2), the implication event1 -> (event1 ∨ event2) is always true in any state (it is a tautology).
- C3 is ""C2 holds in the next state"" (Next(C2)).
- The context says: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. Thus at the initial state event2 is true but there is no next state (no further events occur).
- In standard temporal semantics, Next(φ) is false when no next state exists. So Next(C2) (C3) is false.
- C4 is ""event2 happens and C3 holds"" = event2 ∧ Next(C2). At the initial state event2 is true but Next(C2) is false, so C4 is false.
- C5 is ""C4 does not hold"" = ¬C4. Since C4 is false, C5 is true.

Therefore C5 is True.
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
We must decide whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — the context (timeline)
- Initially (current state s0), event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so in the next state s1 there are no events).
- The rule ""After event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant unless event1 occurs.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions at s0
- C1: ""Event1 or event2 happens."" True at s0 because event2 happened.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" This implication is true at s0 (it’s actually trivially true because C1 already includes event1).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" In s1 there are no events, so the antecedent of C2 (""event1 happens"") is false there, making C2 true in s1 as well. Thus C3 is true at s0.
- C4: ""Event2 happens and C3 holds."" Event2 does happen at s0 and we just saw C3 is true, so C4 is true at s0.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 does hold, C5 is false.

Final answer: False"

Sample responses:
The hypothesis asks whether C5 is true or false.

Step-by-step:
- C1 is ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"", which is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"". The context says event1 happened initially, so C1 is true.
- C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" — that contradicts C1, so C2 is false (at least in the initial state).
- C3 is ""C2 always holds"" — since C2 is false now, C3 is false.
- C4 is ""C3 holds in the next state"" — C3 is already false, so C4 is false.
- C5 is ""C4 always holds"" — since C4 is false, C5 is false.

Therefore C5 is False.
---
Goal: decide whether C5 is True or False.

Step 1 — understand propositions
- C1 = ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" which is just equivalent to ""Event1 happens"" (redundant disjunction).
- C2 = not C1.
- C3 = always C2 (globally, C2 holds at every state).
- C4 = next C3 (C3 holds in the next state).
- C5 = always C4 (C4 holds at every state).

Step 2 — use the context
- Initially, event1 happened, so C1 is true in the initial state.
- Therefore C2 is false in the initial state.

Step 3 — evaluate the temporal formulas
- C3 = always C2 cannot be true because C2 is already false at the initial state.
- Hence C4 = next C3 is false (C3 is false overall, so it cannot hold in the next state).
- Therefore C5 = always C4 is false (C4 is already false at the initial state).

Conclusion: C5 is False.
---
Summary of what is asked: determine whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true or false given the context. I'll evaluate the conditions step by step over the timeline of states.

Interpretation/assumptions:
- ""Event1 happens"" in the context means it happens in the initial state (state 0).
- Events are instantaneous: an event holding at one state does not automatically hold at later states unless stated.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means from the state after event1 onward there are no further events (a quiescent future).

Step-by-step evaluation:
1. C1 = ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"". By context this is true in the initial state (state 0).
2. C2 = ""C1 does not hold"" is thus false at the initial state (negation of a true proposition).
3. C3 = ""C2 always holds"" is false at the initial state because C2 is false right now, and ""always"" requires it hold at all times including now.
4. C4 = ""C3 holds in the next state"" — we must inspect the next state (state 1). In state 1, event1 does not happen (events are instantaneous and only happened in state 0), so C1 is false at state 1 and hence C2 is true at state 1. Moreover, from state 1 onward no events occur, so C2 remains true at every future state starting at state 1; therefore in state 1 the property ""C2 always holds"" (C3) is true. Thus C3 holds in the next state, so C4 is true at the initial state.
5. C5 = ""C4 always holds"" requires C4 to be true in every state. For any future state (state k ≥ 0): in that state event1 does not hold (except at state 0), so from that state onward C1 is false and C2 is true at and after that state; hence C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true when evaluated from any state ≥1, so C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is true at every state, including state 0. Therefore C4 holds in all states and C5 is true.

Conclusion: True."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Context: initially event2 happened; after event2 no further events can occur; after event1, event2 must happen. Because event2 already happened initially and no events can occur afterwards, event1 never occurs at any future state.

- C1 (""event2 happens in the next state""): False — there are no events after the initial event2, so event2 does not necessarily happen in the next state.

- C2 (""C1 always holds"" = □C1): False — C1 fails at the initial/next-state point, so it cannot hold everywhere.

- C3 (""event1 happens and C2 holds""): False — event1 never happens, and C2 is false.

- C4 (""C3 always holds"" = □C3): False — C3 is false.

- C5 (""C4 eventually holds"" = ◇C4): False — C4 is never true at any state, so it cannot eventually hold.

Therefore C5 is False.
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — restate the context and the Cs
- Context:
  1. Initially, event2 happened.
  2. After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has occurred, there are no further events in any later state).
  3. After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 ever occurs then event2 must follow).
- Hypothesis clauses:
  C1: Event2 happens in the next state.
  C2: C1 always holds.
  C3: Event1 happens and C2 holds.
  C4: C3 always holds.
  C5: C4 eventually holds.

Step 3 — reason about possible sequences
- Because event2 has already happened initially and after event2 no further events can happen, no events (including event1) can ever occur in any subsequent state.
- Therefore event1 never happens, and there are no new occurrences of event2 in later states either.

Step 4 — evaluate the conditions
- C1 (event2 happens in the next state): false, since no events occur after the initial event2.
- C2 (C1 always holds): false because C1 is false now (and at all times).
- C3 (event1 happens and C2 holds): false (event1 never happens and C2 is false).
- C4 (C3 always holds): false.
- C5 (C4 eventually holds): false, because C4 never holds at any time.

Final answer
False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- The hypothesis asks whether C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event2 happened (so the initial state has event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Thus once event2 has occurred, event1 cannot occur at any later state.)
- Also: after event1, event2 must happen — this is irrelevant because event1 can never occur after the initial event2.

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Whether this holds at the initial state depends on whether event2 repeats; but the crucial point is that no future state can have event1.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Even if C1 were true initially, C2 requires C1 at every state.
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" This requires event1 to happen at some state.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" This requires that at every state event1 happens and C2 holds.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" This requires that from some future point onward, C3 holds at every state — in particular, it requires event1 to start occurring (and then occur forever).

Step 4 — trace consequences
- Because event2 happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, event1 can never happen at any future state.
- Therefore C3 (which requires event1) can never be true at any state.
- If C3 never holds, C4 (""always C3"") cannot begin to hold at any future point.
- Hence C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") cannot be satisfied.

Conclusion
- C5 is False."

Step 1 — what's asked:
Determine whether C5 (""Event2 happens or C4 holds"") is true or false given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — evaluate conditions from the context:
- Context says event1 happened initially. Therefore C1 (""Event1 eventually happens"") is true, and C2 (same statement) is also true.
- C3 is ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Since C1 and C2 are both true, the implication C3 is true.
- C4 is ""C3 does not hold."" Because C3 does hold, C4 is false.
- From the context, after event1 event2 must happen; since event1 did happen, event2 does happen.

Step 3 — evaluate C5:
C5 is ""Event2 happens or C4 holds."" Event2 does happen (true), so the disjunction is true regardless of C4.

True

We are asked whether C5 (""Event2 happens or C4 holds"") is true given the context and other conditions.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Context: Initially event1 happened.
2. From that, ""event1 eventually happens"" is true (it already happened). So C1 = True and C2 = True.
3. C3 is ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Since C1 and C2 are both True, C3 = True.
4. C4 is ""C3 does not hold."" Because C3 is True, C4 = False.
5. From the context ""After event1, event2 must happen,"" and since event1 did happen, event2 does happen. Therefore the disjunct ""Event2 happens"" is True.
6. C5 is the disjunction ""Event2 happens or C4 holds."" With ""Event2 happens"" True, the disjunction C5 is True regardless of C4.

Step 1 — what is asked
- Determine whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is True or False given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — understand the context and its consequences
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So once that initial event2 has occurred, event1 can never occur at any time (there are no later events).
- Also ""After event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event1 never occurs.

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Given the context, event1 never happens. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 never becomes true, C2 is false.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" This is an implication with a false antecedent (C2 is false), so C3 is vacuously true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is true, C4 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s asked
C5 says ""C4 always holds"". We must decide whether that is true given the context and the definitions C1–C4.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1 = (event2) or (event1).
  Initially event1 happened, so C1 is true (at least at the initial point).
- C2 = not C1.
  Since C1 is true, C2 is false (at that point).
- C3 = C2 or event1 = false or event1 = event1.
  So C3 is equivalent to event1.
- C4 = event1 and C3 = event1 and event1 = event1.
  So C4 is equivalent to event1.

Step 3 — C5 (""C4 always holds"")
C5 therefore asserts ""event1 always holds."" But from the context, after event1, event2 must happen (and after event2, event1 must happen), so event1 does not hold at all times (there are times when event2 holds instead). Therefore C5 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
The hypothesis asks whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true or false.

Step 2 — understand the conditions (simplify)
- C1: event2 ∨ event1.
- C2: ¬C1 = ¬(event2 ∨ event1) = ¬event2 ∧ ¬event1.
- C3: C2 ∨ event1 = (¬event2 ∧ ¬event1) ∨ event1, which simplifies to event1 ∨ ¬event2.
- C4: event1 ∧ C3 = event1 ∧ (event1 ∨ ¬event2). Since event1 ⇒ (event1 ∨ ¬event2), C4 simplifies to event1.
- C5: ""C4 always holds"" ≡ ""event1 always holds"" (i.e. at all times/event points).

Step 3 — trace the event sequence from the context
Context: initially event1 happens; after event1, event2 must happen; after event2, event1 must happen. That enforces an alternating sequence: event1, then event2, then event1, then event2, ... . In particular there are times when event2 occurs and event1 does not hold at that time.

Step 4 — conclude about C5
Because C4 ≡ event1 and there are times when event2 occurs (and event1 does not), C4 does not hold at those times. Therefore C4 does not hold always, so C5 is false.

False

Sample responses:
We want to know whether C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true given the context.

Context summary:
- Initially, event2 happened (so at time 0 event2 occurs).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so no events after time 0).
- Also: after event1, event2 must happen (but event1 never occurs in this context because event2 already happened first and no further events are possible).

Step-by-step evaluation of the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is just the same as ""event2 happens."" That is true at the initial time (event2 did happen), so C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 already holds at the initial moment, C2 is true (an eventuality is satisfied immediately).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" This says: at every point in time, it must be true that eventually C1 holds. But after the initial moment there are no further occurrences of event2, so at a later time there is no future point where event2 will happen — hence ""eventually C1"" is false at times after the initial moment. Therefore C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 holds and event1 happens."" Since C3 is false and event1 never happens (no events after event2), C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" Because C4 is false now and will never become true (no future events can make C3 true or make event1 happen), C5 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- C1 is just ""event2 happens"" (the disjunction is redundant). That is true at the initial moment because the context says event2 happened initially.
- C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true at the initial moment as well (event2 has already occurred, so ""event2 happens"" holds now, hence eventually).
- C3 (""C2 always holds"" or G C2) requires that at every future time, C2 will hold. But after the initial event2 no further events can occur, and event2 does not reoccur in the future. At times after the initial moment, ""event2 happens (in the future of that time)"" is false, so C2 is false at those times. Therefore C3 is false.
- C4 (""C3 holds and event1 happens"") is false because C3 is false (whether or not event1 ever happens).
- C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is false because C4 is never true.

So C5 is False.

Step 1 — what is being asked

  - After event2, no other events can happen (the system is stuck after that point).
  - If event1 ever happens, event2 must happen afterwards (but given the first two points, event1 cannot occur after event2).
- Conditions:
  - C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" → this just asserts event2 happens (redundant).
  - C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" → there will be a time when event2 happens. That is true (it happens initially).
  - C3: ""C2 always holds."" → at every time point, it must be true that event2 will eventually occur in the future.
  - C4: ""C3 holds and event1 happens.""
  - C5: ""C4 eventually holds.""

Step 3 — reason about sequences
- event2 occurs at the initial time. After that, no events can occur, so there is no future occurrence of event2 or event1.
- C1 is true at the initial time (event2 occurred).
- C2 holds at the initial time (event2 does occur eventually — immediately).
- But C3 requires that at every time point, event2 will occur sometime in the future. This fails at times after the initial occurrence: from any time strictly after the initial event2, there is no future event2 (because no further events can happen). Thus C3 is false.
- Since C3 is false, C4 (""C3 and event1"") cannot be true (and additionally event1 never occurs because no events can happen after the initial event2).
- Therefore C4 never holds, so C5 (""eventually C4"") is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify what is asked
- C5 is the statement ""C4 does not hold."" We must decide if C5 is True or False given the context and the definitions C1–C4.

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially event2 happened. So event2 does happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen. Since event2 did happen, event1 does happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen (not needed further here).

Step 3 — evaluate conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is false (event2 does happen).
- C2: same as C1, so false.
- C3: ""C1 holds and C2 holds."" Since C1 and C2 are both false, C3 is false.
- C4: ""If event1 happens, then C3 holds."" But event1 does happen (from context) while C3 is false, so the implication is false. Thus C4 does not hold.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is false, C5 is true.

Final answer: True

Step 1 — facts from the context:
- Event2 did happen (initially).
- Because event2 happened, event1 must happen — so event1 does happen.
- After event1 no other events can happen (not needed further).

Step 2 — evaluate hypothesis components:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" — false (event2 did happen).
- C2: same as C1 — false.
- C3: C1 and C2 — false (conjunction of false statements).
- C4: ""If event1 happens, then C3 holds."" Event1 does happen, but C3 is false, so the implication is false.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is false, C5 is true.

Step 1 — what's asked:
We must decide whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is true or false given the context and the hypothesis clauses.

Step 2 — examine conditions:

- C1, C2: ""Event2 does not happen."" Both are therefore false (they contradict the context).
- C3: C1 and C2. Since C1 and C2 are false, C3 is false.
- C4: ""If event1 happens, then C3 holds."" This implication is false exactly when event1 happens and C3 is false.
- From context, event2 happened, so event1 must happen. Thus event1 happens and C3 is false, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" — since C4 is false, C5 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C5 (C1 holds and C4 holds) is true.

Step-by-step:

- Context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. Thus event1 can never occur at any time.
- C1 (event1 eventually happens) is therefore false. (C2 is the same and also false.)
- C3 is ""C2 does not hold"" — since C2 is false, C3 is true.
- C4 is ""C3 always holds"" — because at every state C2 is false, C3 is always true, so C4 is true.
- C5 = C1 and C4 = (false) and (true) = false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C5 (C1 holds and C4 holds) is true or false under the given context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is absorbing).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is absorbing).
Because event2 already happened initially and it is absorbing, no further events (including event1) can ever occur.

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Given the context, event1 never happens. So C1 is false.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false, C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" At every time point, it remains true that event1 will never happen (because event2 occurred and prevents any future events), so C3 holds at all times. Thus C4 is true.
- C5: ""C1 holds and C4 holds."" C1 is false and C4 is true, so the conjunction is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 has happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. (So once event2 has happened, event1 can never happen later.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (Irrelevant here because event1 did not occur.)

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Given event2 already happened and blocks any further events, C1 is false.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false, C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" C2 is false now and can never become true, so C3 is always true; C4 is true.
- C5: ""C1 holds and C4 holds."" C1 is false while C4 is true, so their conjunction is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
C5 is the statement ""C4 eventually holds."" We must determine whether C5 is true or false given the context and the other Ci.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p). It is true in every state.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 is true now (indeed true in all states), C1 holds at some future instant (in fact immediately), so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This is the negation of C2. Because C2 is true, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" C3 is false (already), so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" Since C4 is false in every state, C4 never holds, so C5 is false.

Step 3 — role of the context
The context (initially event1 happened; after event1 no other events can happen; after event2 event1 must happen) does not change the above logical relationships — C1 is tautologically true, making C2 true and propagating the falsity of C3, C4, and C5.

Final answer: False
---
First: what is being asked
- Determine whether C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true or false given the context and the chain of statements C1–C5.

Second: examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a logical tautology (A → A). It is true immediately (at every point).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 already holds now (and at all times), C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This is the negation of C2, so C3 is false because C2 is true.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" C3 is false, so it cannot hold always; C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" Since C4 is false at every time, there is no time at which C4 holds, so C5 is false.

Third: check compatibility with the event-context
- The context (event1 initially happened; after event1 no other events can happen) only reinforces that C1 holds immediately and that nothing can change that to make C4 true later.

Final answer
False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- The question asks whether C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true or false.

- C1 is ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (an implication of the form P → P), so C1 holds (indeed it holds at all times, and certainly at the initial state where event1 happened).

- C2 says ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 already holds now (and always), C2 is true.

- C3 says ""C2 does not hold."" That is the negation of a true statement, so C3 is false.

- C4 says ""C3 always holds."" Because C3 is false, C4 is false.

- C5 says ""C4 eventually holds."" Since C4 is false and never becomes true, C5 is false.

Therefore the final answer is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"") is true or false, given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event1 has happened (call this state S0).
- After event1, event2 must happen, so the next state S1 has event2.
- After event2, no other events can happen, so S1 is terminal (no further successor states).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (i.e. it is not true that event2 always happens)
- C3: ""Event2 always happens."" (same as C1)
- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds."" (i.e. C1 is false AND event2 always happens)
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state.""

Note C1 and C3 are the same statement; C2 denies C1, so C4 is a conjunction that requires both a statement and its negation — a contradiction.

Step 4 — evaluate in the next state (S1)
- In S1, event2 has happened and S1 is terminal, so any ""always"" statement about event2 (holding in all states along the path) is true in S1. Thus C3 is true in S1, and so is C1 (they are identical).
- C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false in S1 because C1 does hold there.
- Therefore C4 = C2 and C3 is false (false AND true = false) in S1.

Step 5 — conclusion about C5
- C5 asserts C4 holds in the next state; but we just found C4 is false in the next state S1. Therefore C5 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — understand the context
- Initially event1 has happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 inevitably occurs after the initial moment).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

So any run consistent with the context is: initial state with event1, then at some point event2 occurs, then nothing else.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1: Event2 always happens. Given the context (event1 happened initially and after event1 event2 must happen), C1 is true.
- C2: C1 does not hold. This contradicts C1, so C2 is false.
- C3: Event2 always happens. Same as C1, so C3 is true.
- C4: C2 holds and C3 holds. That is false AND true, so C4 is false.
- C5: C4 holds in the next state. Since C4 is false now and remains false in the next state (the truths about event2 and C1/C3 don't change), C5 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Identify the hypothesis: we must decide whether C5 (“C4 holds in the next state”) is true or false.

Understand the scenario:
- Initially event1 has happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur at some point after the initial state).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Examine each condition:
- C1: “Event2 always happens.” Given the rule “after event1, event2 must happen” and event1 has happened initially, event2 does occur in every run — so C1 is true.
- C2: “C1 does not hold.” This is the negation of C1, so C2 is false.
- C3: “Event2 always happens.” Same as C1, so C3 is true.
- C4: “C2 holds and C3 holds.” That requires both false (C2) and true (C3) simultaneously, which is impossible, so C4 is false.
- C5: “C4 holds in the next state.” Since C4 is false now and remains false, C5 is false.

Conclusion: C5 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked
You ask whether C5 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" This is true, because event1 already happened initially.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 is already true now, ""eventually C1"" is true (F F φ = F φ and F includes the current state).
- C3: same reasoning: C3 is true (nested eventualities collapse to the same eventuality).
- C4: ""C3 holds and event2 happens."" Although C3 holds, event2 does not happen: event1 happened initially and rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" prevents any occurrence of event2. So C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" If C4 is false anywhere, it cannot hold in the next state; given event1 blocks further events, there's no way for C4 to become true in the next state.

Step 3 — conclusion
C5 is False.
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Initially event1 happened, so ""event1 eventually happens"" (C1) is true immediately.
- ""Eventually C1"" (C2) is then true (eventually includes the current state, so C1 already holds).
- Likewise ""Eventually C2"" (C3) is true for the same reason.
- C4 is ""C3 holds and event2 happens."" Although C3 holds, event2 never happens: since event1 already happened and the context says ""after event1, no other events can happen,"" event2 cannot occur at any state. So C4 is false.
- C5 is ""C4 holds in the next state."" Since C4 is false at all states, C5 is false.

Therefore C5 is False.
---
Step 1 — understand the context
- Initially event1 happens.
- If event2 ever happens, then event1 must happen afterward.
- After event1 happens, no other events can happen (so event2 never occurs after the initial event1).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True, because event1 happens initially.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 already holds at the initial state, ""eventually C1"" is true at the initial state as well. So C2 is true at the initial state.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" For the same reason, C2 holds now, so ""eventually C2"" is true now; C3 is true at the initial state.
- C4: ""C3 holds and event2 happens."" Although C3 holds, event2 never happens (after the initial event1 no events can happen and event2 did not occur initially). Therefore C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" Because C4 is false (event2 never happens), C4 does not hold in any state, so C5 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
First, the question: is C5 true or false given the context and the conditions C1–C4?

Step-by-step reasoning

1. From the context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. Therefore event1 cannot happen (there is no time at which event1 can occur once event2 has happened).

2. Evaluate C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is true (tautologically true, and in fact event2 does happen).

3. Evaluate C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Since C1 holds, C2 is equivalent to saying event1 happens. But from (1) event1 does not happen. So C2 is false.

4. Evaluate C3: ""C2 always holds."" C2 is false, so C3 does not hold (C3 is false).

5. Evaluate C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is false, C4 is true.

6. Evaluate C5: ""If C4 holds, then event1 happens."" C4 does hold (true), so for C5 to be true event1 would have to happen. But event1 cannot happen (from (1)). Therefore C5 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning, step by step:

- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautologically true implication, and given the context (event2 did happen initially) C1 holds.

- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Since C1 holds, C2 is equivalent to ""event1 happens."" So C2 is true exactly when event1 happens.

- Context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. Thus event1 does not happen (there is no time for event1 to occur).

- Therefore C2 is false (because event1 does not happen). Hence C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false, and C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is true.

- C5: ""If C4 holds, then event1 happens."" We have C4 true and event1 false, so the implication C5 is false.

Thus C5 is False.

Sample responses:
First, what is being asked:
- C5 is the disjunction ""C3 holds or C4 holds"". We must decide whether C5 is true given the context.

Examine the context and timeline:
- Initially (time 0) event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so at time 1, event1 occurs).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so from time 2 onward no events occur).

Evaluate each condition (at the initial state unless otherwise stated):
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" — that asks whether event2 occurs at time 1. But at time 1 event1 occurs (not event2). So C1 is false.
- C4: same as C1, so C4 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — that asks whether, at time 1, C1 is true (i.e., whether event2 happens at time 2). But after event1 no events can happen, so event2 does not happen at time 2. So C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — since C2 is false at the initial state, C3 is false.

Thus both C3 and C4 are false, so their disjunction C5 is false.

Final answer:
False

Goal: determine whether C5 (""C3 holds or C4 holds"") is true given the context.

Context summary:
- Initially event2 happened (call that state s0).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so in the next state s1, event1 occurs).
- After event1, no other events can happen (s1 is terminal; no further event occurrences).

Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" From s0, the next state s1 has event1 (by the second rule), not event2. So C1 is false.
- C4 is the same as C1, so C4 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That asks whether in s1 the proposition C1 is true, i.e. whether event2 happens in s2 (two steps from s0). But s1 is terminal (no events after event1), so event2 does not happen in s2. Thus C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is already false (it does not hold in s1), C3 is false.

Therefore both C3 and C4 are false, so C5 (C3 or C4) is false.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Context gives the sequence: initially event2 happens, then event1 must happen next, and after event1 no other events can happen. So the actual sequence of events is: at the initial state event2, at the next state event1, and then termination.

- C1 (""Event2 happens in the next state""): false, because the next state contains event1 (not event2).

- C2 (""C1 holds in the next state""): false, because at the next state (where event1 occurs) C1 would assert that event2 happens in its next state — but after event1 no events occur, so that is false.

- C3 (""C2 always holds""): false, since C2 is already false at the initial state.

- C4 is the same as C1, so it is false.

- C5 (""C3 holds or C4 holds""): both disjuncts are false, so C5 is false.

Therefore C5 is False."

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true given the context.

Step 1 — what the context forces
- Initially event1 occurred.
- From any state after event1, event2 must occur at some future point (event2 is inevitable).
- Once event2 occurs, no further events occur (event2 is terminal).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" This may or may not be true at a particular state (event2 could occur immediately or after some delay).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Because event2 must occur at some future time, consider the state immediately before the state where event2 occurs; at that state, the next state has event2, so C1 is true there. Therefore C2 holds (there will always be some state where the next state contains event2).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This contradicts the previous line, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" Since C3 is false, C4 is false (it does not hold in the next state).
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" Because C4 is false, it cannot hold in all states; hence C5 is false.

Final answer:
False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked
C5 is the statement ""If C1 holds, then C4 holds."" We must decide whether C5 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — evaluate the context
- Initially event2 happens.
- After event2, event1 must happen → so event1 does happen later.
- After event1, no other events can happen → event1 is terminal.
So both event2 and event1 occur (event2 first, then event1), and nothing else occurs.

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" True (both happen).
- C2: same as C1. True.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" True (C2 holds already, so it certainly holds at some time).
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" False (since C3 is true).

Step 4 — evaluate C5
C5 is ""If C1 holds, then C4 holds."" But C1 is true and C4 is false, so the implication is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
You are asked whether C5 (""If C1 holds, then C4 holds"") is True or False given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition from the context
- From the context, event2 happens initially. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, no other events can happen. Thus the actual sequence contains event2 and then event1; both events occur.
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" True (both occur).
- C2: same as C1, so True.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 holds, C3 is True.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This is False because C3 holds.
- C5: ""If C1 holds, then C4 holds."" Since C1 holds but C4 is false, the implication is false.

Final answer: False

Identification: C5 asserts (C1 -> C4). We must decide if that's true given the context.

Facts from the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, no other events occur.

From those facts:
- Both event2 and event1 occur in the sequence (event2 first, then event1).
- C1 (""event1 happens or event2 happens"") is true.
- C2 is the same as C1, so true.
- C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true (C2 holds at least when event2 or event1 occurs).
- C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is false (because C3 does hold).

Evaluate C5: ""If C1 holds, then C4 holds."" The antecedent C1 is true while the consequent C4 is false, so the implication is false.

Sample responses:
What the hypothesis asks
- Is C5 true or false under the given context?

Examine the context
- Initially event1 happened (so at time 0, event1 is true).
- After event1, event2 must happen → there will be a later time when event2 occurs.
- After event2, event1 must happen → there will be a later time when event1 occurs.
Combined, starting from the initial event1, the requirements force event2 to occur later, then event1 again, and so on (an alternating sequence). In particular, event2 does occur at some time.

Evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is (redundantly) equivalent to ""event2 happens."" Given the context, C1 is true at some time (event2 does occur).
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" Since event1 already happened initially, C2 holds immediately (and continues to hold at times when one of them holds).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Because C2 holds now (at time 0), C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This is the negation of C3; since C3 is true, C4 is false (and cannot become true later, because C2 will continue to occur in the future as events alternate).
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" Since C4 is false now and never becomes true in the allowed event sequence, C5 is false.

Final answer
False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened (so at time 0 event1 occurs).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so after any occurrence of event1 there will be a later occurrence of event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so after any occurrence of event2 there will be a later occurrence of event1).
- Together these force an infinite alternation: event1, event2, event1, event2, ... (both events occur infinitely often).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" is equivalent to ""event2 happens"" (conjunction of the same atomic fact).
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"" is therefore ""event1 happens or event2 happens"" — i.e., at a time when either event occurs C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" means that from the current point there will be some future time at which either event1 or event2 occurs. Given the alternating behaviour, that is true at the initial time and remains true at every time (there are always future events).
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" is the negation of a statement that is always true, so C4 is always false.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" asks whether at some future time C4 becomes true (i.e., whether there will ever be a time when C3 is false). Since C3 is always true, C4 never becomes true.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C5 is false.

False

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step

1) Interpret the scenario as a timeline with temporal (eventual) constraints:
   - Initially event1 is true at time 0.
   - After event1, event2 must occur (so at some later time).
   - After event2, event1 must occur.
   These constraints force an infinite alternation starting with event1: time 0: e1, time 1: e2, time 2: e1, time 3: e2, …

2) Simplify and read the Cs as time-dependent formulas (standard “eventually” semantics):
   - C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" ≡ event2 (i.e. e2 holds at the current time).
   - C2: ""Event1 happens or C1"" ≡ (e1 or e2). Given the alternation, one of e1 or e2 is true at every time, so C2 is true at every time.
   - C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" (F C2). At any time t there exists t' ≥ t with C2 true — in fact C2 is true at t itself — so C3 is true at every time.
   - C4: ""C3 does not hold"" ≡ ¬C3. Since C3 is true everywhere, C4 is false at every time.
   - C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" (F C4). That asks whether there is any time at or after now where C4 is true. Because C4 is false at every time, C5 is false.

3) Conclusion: C5 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s asked
C5 is ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" We must decide whether that conjunction is true given the event facts.

Step 2 — unpack conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" (i.e. either event1 never happens, or event2 does happen)
- C3: ""C2 always holds.""
- C4: ""Event1 does not happen."" (same as C1)
- C5: C3 and C4.

Step 3 — use the context
- Initially event1 happened. So event1 does happen (at least at the initial time). Therefore C1 and C4 (""Event1 does not happen"") are false.
- The rules force alternation: after event1, event2 must happen; after event2, event1 must happen. Thus event2 does indeed occur. That makes C2 true (because event2 happens makes the disjunction true).
- If C2 is true as a global fact, C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true as stated.

Step 4 — conclude about C5
C5 = C3 and C4. Even if C3 is true, C4 is false (event1 does happen), so the conjunction is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C5 (C3 holds and C4 holds) is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the conditions given the context
- Context: initially event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, event1 must happen. So event1 does occur (at least initially), and event2 will occur after it; they alternate.

- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This contradicts the context (event1 did happen initially), so C1 is False. Likewise C4 repeats C1, so C4 is False.

- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" Since C1 is False but event2 does happen (following the initial event1), C2 is True (there is an event2).

- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Whether C3 is true depends on how ""always"" is interpreted, but we do not need to resolve that: C5 requires both C3 and C4.

Step 3 — combine for C5
- C5 = C3 and C4. C4 is False, so C5 is False regardless of C3.

Final answer: False

What is being asked
- You are asked whether C5 is true or false. C5 is the conjunction C3 and C4.

- C4: same as C1 (""Event1 does not happen""), so C4 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" Since C1 is false, C2 simplifies to ""event2 happens.""
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" That would mean ""event2 always happens"" if taken literally, but we do not need to resolve C3 because…

- C5 = C3 and C4. Because C4 is false, the conjunction C5 is false regardless of C3.

Sample responses:
You are asking whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step-by-step simplification:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" ≡ ""Event1 happens"".  
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" ≡ (event1 → event1), which is a tautology (always true).  
- C3: same as C1, so C3 ≡ ""Event1 happens"".  
- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds"" ≡ (True) and (event1) ≡ ""Event1 happens"".  
- C5: ""C4 always holds"" ≡ ""Event1 always holds"" (i.e., event1 holds at all times).

From the context: initially event1 happens, but after event1 event2 must happen, and after event2 event1 must happen. That produces an alternating sequence (event1, event2, event1, ...). Event1 does not hold at the times when event2 occurs, so event1 is not true at all times.

Therefore C5 (""Event1 always holds"") is False. 

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
You are asked whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — simplify the conditions
- Let E1 mean ""Event1 happens"".
- C1: E1 or E1 ≡ E1.
- C3: same as C1 ≡ E1.
- C2: If E1 then C1 ≡ E1 → E1, which is a tautology (always true).
- C4: C2 ∧ C3 ≡ True ∧ E1 ≡ E1.
- C5: ""C4 always holds"" ≡ ""E1 always holds"" (E1 at all times).

Step 3 — use the context
Context: initially E1 happens, then E2 must happen, then after E2 E1 must happen, etc. So events alternate (E1, E2, E1, E2, ...). E1 does not hold at the times when E2 holds.

Step 4 — conclusion
C5 asserts E1 always holds, but E1 is not true during the E2 times. Therefore C5 is False.

Final answer: False

False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 and C3 are both ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"", i.e. equivalent to ""Event1 happens"".
- C2 is ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" → event1 → event1, which is always true (a tautology).
- C4 = C2 ∧ C3. Since C2 is always true, C4 is true exactly when C3 (i.e. ""Event1 happens"") is true.
- From the context, events alternate: event1 at t0, event2 at t1, event1 at t2, etc. There are times (e.g. t1, t3, ...) when event1 does not happen, so C3 (and thus C4) is false at those times.
- Therefore C4 does not hold at all times, so C5 (""C4 always holds"") is false."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
C5 asserts: ""always (C2 or C3)"". We must decide whether that is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the Ci
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (i.e. event2 never occurs)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (i.e. it is always true that event2 never occurs)
- C3: same as C1.
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds"" (disjunction of the above)
- C5: ""C4 always holds.""

Step 3 — use the context rules
- Initially event1 happened.
- The rule ""After event1, event2 must happen"" means that because event1 occurred initially, event2 will occur afterward.
- Therefore event2 does occur in the system.

Step 4 — evaluate the Ci
- Since event2 does occur, C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is false (and so is C3).
- Hence C2 (""C1 always holds"") is also false.
- Therefore C4 (C2 or C3) is false.
- Because C4 is false at least at the initial time, C5 (""always C4"") is false.

Final answer: False

Identify hypothesis
- C5 asserts: ""C4 always holds.""
- C4 is ""C2 holds or C3 holds.""
- C2 = ""C1 always holds"" and C1 = ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C3 = ""Event2 does not happen.""

Examine context and conditions
- Context: initially event1 happened. Also, after event1, event2 must happen. (So because event1 did happen initially, event2 must occur at some later time.)
- Therefore event2 does happen (at least once).

Trace consequences
- C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is false, because event2 does occur.
- C2 (""C1 always holds"" i.e. event2 never happens) is false.
- C3 (""Event2 does not happen"") is false.
- Hence C4 (""C2 holds or C3 holds"") is false.
- Therefore C5 (""C4 always holds"") is false.

Final answer: False

Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context and consequences:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- The rule ""After event1, event2 must happen"" implies that because event1 happened initially, event2 must (eventually) happen.
- Therefore event2 does happen.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This contradicts the conclusion above, so C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3: same as C1, so false.
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" Both are false, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" C4 is false, so C5 is false.

Final answer:
False"

Sample responses:
First, what is being asked:
- We must decide whether C5 (""C4 holds or event2 happens"") is true or false, given the context and the other conditions.

Now examine the context and each condition step by step.

Context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So no events occur at any time after that initial event1.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (This only constrains runs where event2 occurs; it requires event1 to follow event2.)

Conditions:
- C1: If event1 happens, then event2 happens. (So because event1 did happen, C1 would require event2 to happen.)
- C2: If event1 happens, then C1 holds. (Because event1 happened, C2 asserts C1 is true.)
- C3: C2 eventually holds. (At some time C2 must become true.)
- C4: C3 always holds. (At every time, C3 holds — in particular C3 must hold now.)
- C5: C4 holds or event2 happens. (The disjunction we must evaluate.)

Trace and reasoning:
1. event1 did happen initially. By ""after event1, no other events can happen,"" there can be no event2 at any later time. Also there is no earlier time before the initial state to place event2, so event2 does not occur anywhere.
2. Since event1 did happen but event2 does not occur, the implication in C1 (event1 -> event2) is false. So C1 is false.
3. C2 is ""if event1 happens then C1 holds."" event1 did happen, but C1 is false, so C2 is false.
4. C3 says C2 eventually holds. But C2 is already false and, because no events (and no changes) can happen after event1, C2 will never become true later. So C3 is false.
5. C4 says C3 always holds. Since C3 is false now (and never becomes true), C4 is false.
6. We already established event2 does not happen. Thus both disjuncts in C5 (C4 holds) or (event2 happens) are false.

Conclusion:
- C5 is False.
---
First, what is asked: determine whether C5 (""C4 holds or event2 happens"") is true or false under the given context.

Given context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. => no future event2; event2 never occurs.
- After event2, event1 must happen. (Irrelevant because event2 never occurs, so the implication is vacuously satisfied.)

Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" But event1 does happen (initially) and event2 never happens, so C1 is false.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Event1 does happen, but C1 is false, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 is false now and cannot become true (no events can change these facts), so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" C3 is false, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 holds or event2 happens."" Both disjuncts are false (C4 false, event2 never happens), so C5 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Context: event1 happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen. Therefore event2 does not happen anywhere in the execution.

2. C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Since event1 does happen but event2 does not, the implication is false. So C1 is false.

3. C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Because event1 happens but C1 is false, this implication is false. So C2 is false.

4. C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 is already false at the initial (and nothing changes afterwards), so C2 never holds; C3 is false.

5. C4: ""C3 always holds."" C3 is false, so C4 is false.

6. C5: ""C4 holds or event2 happens."" Both disjuncts are false (C4 is false, event2 never happens), so C5 is false.

Therefore C5 is False."

Sample responses:
You are asking whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true given the context.

Interpretation:
- Timeline: t0 (initial): event2 happens. By the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"", at t1 event1 happens. By ""after event1, no other events can happen"", at t2 and thereafter no events occur.
- C1: ""event2 happens in the next state"" (i.e., at the next time point).
- C2: ""event1 happens (now) and C1 holds"" (so event1 now and event2 next).
- C3: same as C1.
- C4: C2 or C3.
- C5: always C4 (C4 holds at every state).

Check states:
- At t0: event2 happens now. C3/C1 claim event2 at t1 — that is false (t1 has event1). C2 requires event1 now and event2 next — event1 is not true at t0, so C2 false. Thus C4 is false at t0.
- At t1: event1 happens now. C1/C3 claim event2 at t2 — false (no events after event1). C2 requires event2 next as well, so C2 false. Thus C4 false at t1.
- At t2 and beyond: no events, so C2 and C3 are false, so C4 false.

Since C4 is already false at t0 (and at other times), ""always C4"" is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the claim
- C5 says ""always (C4)"". C4 is ""C2 or C3"".
- C3 is ""event2 happens in the next state"".
- C2 is ""event1 happens and C1 holds"", where C1 is ""event2 happens in the next state"".
- So C2 implies C1, and C1 is the same as C3. Thus C4 ≡ C3 (C4 holds exactly when event2 happens in the next state).

Step 2 — use the context to find a counterexample
- Context: initially event2 happened. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, no other events can happen.
- A valid trace: s0 (initial): event2 happened. s1: event1 happens (required). s2: no events can happen (because after event1 no events can happen).
- In state s1, ""event2 happens in the next state"" is false (there is no event2 in s2). So C3 (hence C4) is false in s1.

Step 3 — conclude about C5
- C5 requires C4 to hold in every state, but we found a state (s1) where C4 is false. Therefore C5 is not true.

Final answer: False
---
We want to know whether C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true given the scenario.

Context (timeline):
- S0 (initial): event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → S1: event1 happens.
- After event1, no other events can happen → no events occur after S1.

Check the conditions at the initial state S0:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" At S0 the next state S1 has event1, not event2. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" C1 is false, so C2 is false.
- C3: same as C1, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" Both false, so C4 is false at S0.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" Because C4 is already false at S0, C5 is false.

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is True or False.

Step 1 — what’s given about events
- Initially, event1 happened — so event1 is true at the initial state.
- After event1, no other events can happen — event1 is terminal.
- (The clause about event2 is irrelevant because event2 cannot occur after the initial event1.)

Step 2 — examine the Ci formulas
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (φ → φ), so C1 is true at every time point.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 is true now (and in fact always), ""eventually C1"" is true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Because C2 is true now, ""eventually C2"" is true.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Because C3 is true now, ""eventually C3"" is true.

Thus C4 holds. C5 asserts ""C4 does not hold,"" which is the negation of a true statement, so C5 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning, step by step:

- The question asks whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is true or false given the context.
- C1 is the formula ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (it holds in any state where ""event1"" is either true or false).
- C2 is ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 already holds (it is true now), ""eventually C1"" is satisfied immediately.
- The same reasoning applies to C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") and C4 (""C3 eventually holds""): each is true because the inner condition already holds now.
- C5 is the negation of C4. Because C4 holds, C5 is false.

Therefore C5 is False.
---
The hypothesis is asking whether C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is true or false.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Context facts: event1 has happened initially; once event1 happens no further events can occur; after any event2, event1 must happen (but that is irrelevant once event1 has already happened and no further events can occur).
- C1 (""If event1 happens, then event1 happens"") is a tautology / holds whenever considered (in particular it holds at the initial moment when event1 happened).
- C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true because C1 already holds (so C1 holds now, hence ""eventually"" as well).
- C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true for the same reason (C2 already holds).
- C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true likewise.
- C5 asserts that C4 does not hold. But we have just shown C4 does hold, so C5 is false.

Final answer: False"
