   - C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" is equivalent to Event2 (redundant conjunction).

Context summary:
- Initial state s0: event2 is true.
- From event2, event1 must happen next.
- From event1, no other events can happen (so the system stays at event1 afterwards).

Hypotheses definitions:
- C1: event2 does not happen (i.e., ¬event2 in the current state).
- C2: C1 holds and event2 happens (C2 = ¬event2 AND event2).
- C3: C2 eventually holds (there is some state where C2 is true).
- C4: C3 always holds (C3 is true at every state).
- C5: C4 does not hold (¬C4).

Reasoning:
1. C2 is the conjunction ¬event2 ∧ event2, which is a contradiction and therefore impossible in any single state — C2 is false in every state.
2. Therefore C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is false: there is no state where C2 is true.

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Context implies the system starts in event1 and, because ""after event1, no other events can happen,"" it stays at event1 forever. (Any transition from event1 must lead to event1 again.)
- Therefore event2 never occurs in any state.

Now examine the conditions:

1. C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Since the next state is always event1, C1 is false in every state.
2. C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Because C1 is always false, C2 is false in every state.
3. C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Negating a false statement yields true, so C3 is true in every state.
4. C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" Since C3 is true everywhere (and event1 is also true everywhere), C4 is true in every state.
5. C5: ""C4 always holds."" Because C4 is true in every state, C5 is true.

Hence C5 is True."

- C2 (""If C1 holds, then event2 happens""): at the initial state C1 is true but event2 is not true in the initial state, so C2 is false there. However, at the next state (which is event2), C1 is still true (the following state is event2) and event2 is true now, so the implication C2 is true in that state.

4. Context: initially event2, and after event2 no other events can happen — the system stays in event2 forever.
5. From any state reachable (all are event2), event2 already holds, so ""eventually event2"" is true. Thus C2 holds at every state, so C3 is true.

1. Context summary:
   - Initially event1 is true.
   - After event1, no other events can happen → once in an event1 state, every next state must also be event1 (the system stays at event1 forever).
   - After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant because event2 never occurs from the initial state).

2. Simplify the claims:
   - C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" ≡ event1.
   - C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens"" ≡ event1 AND event1 ≡ event1.
   - C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" ≡ next(event1).
   - C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" ≡ F(next(event1)).
   - C5: ""C4 always holds"" ≡ G(F(next(event1))).

3. Evaluate on the only possible trace: event1, event1, event1, ...
   - event1 is true in every state, so next(event1) is true in every state (each state's next state has event1).
   - Therefore C3 holds at every state.
   - Hence C4 (eventually C3) holds at every state (indeed immediately).
   - Thus C5 (always C4) holds.

Context summary:
- Initially event2 is true.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so the system stays at event2 forever — event1 never occurs).
- After event1, event2 must happen (irrelevant here because event1 never occurs).

Evaluate the claims:

1. C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens.""
   - Event1 never occurs in any state (we start at event2 and no other events can happen), so C1 is false.

2. C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" (event1 → C1)
   - The antecedent (event1) is never true, so the implication is vacuously true. Thus C2 is true.

3. C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" (C2 ∧ event2)
   - C2 is true (above) and event2 is true at the initial (and all) states, so C3 is true.

4. C4: ""Event1 happens and C3 holds."" (event1 ∧ C3)

1. Context rules:
   - Initially event1 is true.
   - After event1, no other events can happen — so from a state with event1, the next state must also be event1 (event1 is absorbing).
   - After event2, event1 must happen — but since event2 never occurs (see next), this rule never gets used.

2. From the context, event2 can never occur: the initial state is event1, and from event1 only event1 can follow, so there's no transition that produces event2.

3. Evaluate C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens"" — this requires both to be true in the same state. Since states are single-event and event2 never occurs, C1 is always false.

4. C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false because C1 never holds.

5. C3 (""C2 holds in the next state"") is false because C2 is always false.

6. C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is false because C3 never holds.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Initial state: event2 is true, so event1 is false.
2. From event2 no other events can happen, so every future state stays with event2 true and event1 false.
3. Therefore ""Event1 does not happen"" (C1 and C3) is true in every state.
4. C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is true in every state because the next state also has event1 false.
5. C4 = C2 AND C3 is true in every state (both conjuncts hold).
6. C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"") is true at the initial state because the next state also has C4 true.

- C4: ""C3 always holds"" → ""Event1 holds at every state.""
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" → ""It is not true that Event1 holds at every state.""

Step 2 — examine the context (possible trace):
- Initially event2 is true (state s0).
- After event2, event1 must happen (state s1 where event1 is true).
- After event1, no other events can happen → event1 persists forever (states s1, s2, ... all have event1).

Step 3 — evaluate C4:
- C4 requires event1 to be true in every state, including the initial state s0.
- In s0 event1 is false (event2 is true), so C4 is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C5:
- C5 states that C4 does not hold. Since C4 is false, C5 is true.

Context summary:
- Initially event2 is true.
- From event2 the next state must be event1.
- From event1 no other events can happen (so once at event1, it stays event1).

Evaluate the hypotheses:

1. C1: event2 AND event1 — this requires both to be true in the same state. That never occurs (initial state has event2 only; the next states have event1 only). So C1 is false in every state.

2. C2: event1 OR C1 — since C1 is always false, C2 is equivalent to event1 (true exactly in states where event1 holds).

3. C3: C2 always holds — this means event1 must hold in every state. But the initial state has event2 (not event1), so C3 is false.

4. C4: C3 does not hold — this is the negation of C3. Since C3 is false, C4 is true (already true at the initial state).

5. C5: C4 eventually holds — because C4 holds now (at the initial state), ""eventually C4"" is true.

   - The rule ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never occurs.

2. Evaluate C1 and C2:
   - C1: event2 happens and event1 happens (simultaneously).
   - C2 is the same as C1.
   - Given the context, event2 never happens, so C1 (and C2) are false in all states.

2. C1 is ""event2 and event1"" (conjunction in one state). That is impossible here, so C1 is false (in the initial state and in every state).

3. C2 is identical to C1, so C2 is also false.

4. C3 is ""event2 and C2"". Since C2 is false, C3 is false.

5. C4 is ""if C3 then event2"". An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C4 is true (vacuously).

6. C5 is ""if C1 then C4"". Since C1 is false, this implication is also true (vacuously).

Therefore C5 is True."

1. Context timeline: initially event2 is true. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, no other events can happen. So the trace is: state0 = event2, state1 = event1, and then event1 persists forever.

2. C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" simplifies to just event2 (event2 ∧ event2 = event2). Thus C1 is true in the initial state and false later (true only at state0).

3. C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" is (C1 → event2). Since C1 is equivalent to event2, C2 is (event2 → event2), which is a tautology and therefore true in every state.

4. C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Because C2 is true immediately (in every state), C3 is satisfied (eventually includes the present). So C3 is true.

5. C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" Since C3 is already true, C4 is true (regardless of event1).

6. C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" C4 holds now, so it eventually holds. Therefore C5 is true.

- Initial state S0: event2.
- From any state with event2 the next state has event1.
- From any state with event1 the next state has event2.
Thus the system alternates: S0(event2), S1(event1), S2(event2), S3(event1), ...

Step 2 — unpack the definitions
- C1(s): ""Event1 happens in the next state"" = event1 at s+1.
- C2(s): same as C1(s).
- C3(s): C1(s) or C2(s) = C1(s).
- C4(s): ""C3 holds in the next state"" = C1(s+1) = event1 at s+2.
- C5(s): ""If C4 holds, then event1 happens"" = (event1 at s+2) ⇒ (event1 at s).

Step 3 — relate C4 to event1 at the current state
Because the system strictly alternates events, event1 holds exactly at odd-indexed states (S1, S3, S5, ...). C4(s) asserts event1 at s+2, so C4(s) is true exactly when s+2 is odd — i.e. when s is odd. But event1(s) is also true exactly when s is odd. Therefore C4(s) ↔ event1(s) for every reachable state s.

Step 4 — evaluate C5
Since C4(s) implies event1(s) (indeed they are equivalent), the implication in C5 holds in every reachable state, including the initial state.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. From the context: initial state = event1. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, event1 must happen. So the system alternates: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...
2. C1 is (event2 AND event2), which is equivalent to just event2. Same for C2.
3. C3 is ""C2 eventually holds"" → ""eventually event2 holds.""
4. C4 is ""if C1 then C3"" → ""if event2 holds then eventually event2 holds.""
5. C5 is ""C4 holds in the next state."" So we evaluate C4 at the state following the initial state.
6. The next state (after the initial event1) is event2. In that state C1 (event2) is true.

Reasoning:
- Timeline: time0 = initial state with event2. By the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"", time1 = event1. From then on, ""after event1, no other events can happen"" means all later states are event1.
- C1 = not event1. So C1 is true at time0 (event1 is false) and false at all times >=1.
- C2 = (event2 ⇒ C1). At time0 event2 is true and C1 is true, so the implication holds; at times >=1 event2 is false so the implication holds vacuously. Thus C2 holds at every state.
- C3 = event1 ∧ C2. That is false at time0 (no event1) and true at every time >=1 (event1 true and C2 holds).
- C4 = next(C3). For any time t, t+1 ≥ 1 so C3 is true at t+1. Hence C4 holds at every time t.
- C5 = always(C4). Since C4 holds at all times, C5 is True."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. System behaviour: states alternate deterministically: initial state has event1, then event2, then event1, ... (after event1 → event2, after event2 → event1).
2. C1 = ""event2 does not happen"" is a state formula. At the initial state (event1) C1 is true; but C2 = ""C1 always holds"" would mean event2 never happens at any future state, which contradicts the required alternation, so C2 is false everywhere.
3. C3 = ""C2 holds in the next state"" therefore is false (the antecedent never holds at any state).
4. C4 = ""event2 does not happen"" is just the same as C1 (true in states where event1 holds, false in states where event2 holds).
5. C5 is the implication (C3 → C4). Since C3 is always false, the implication is vacuously true in every possible state/tracing of the system.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context, event2 is true in the initial state (it ""happened"" initially). After event1 and after event2, no further events can occur, so both are terminal states; in particular event2 occurs now and remains true in the current state.

2. C5 is ""C4 holds or event2 happens"". Since event2 happens in the initial state, the disjunction C5 is immediately true, regardless of C4.

(For completeness: C3 = (C2 holds or event2 happens) is already true because event2 happens; hence C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is false, but that does not affect C5 because the event2 disjunct makes C5 true.)"

1. Context: s0: event1. After event1, event2 must happen (so s1: event2). After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 holds, all following states also have event2).

2. Simplify hypothesis components:
   - C1: (event2 AND event2) ≡ event2.
   - C2: same as C1 ≡ event2.
   - C3: C2 holds in the next state ≡ event2 in the next state.
   - C4: C3 holds in the next state ≡ event2 two steps ahead.
   - C5: If C1 holds, then C4 holds ≡ if event2 holds now, then event2 holds two steps later.

3. From the context, whenever event2 holds in some state, all subsequent states also have event2 (no other events can happen after event2). Therefore event2 holds one step later and two steps later.

4. Thus whenever C1 (event2) is true in a state, C4 (event2 two steps later) is true as well. In states where C1 is false the implication is vacuously true.

1. Simplify C1 and C2:
   - C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" simplifies to Event1.
   - C2: likewise simplifies to Event1.

2. C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" is ""Event1 eventually holds"".
   - From the context: initially event2, and after event2 event1 must happen; after event1 event2 must happen. So the system alternates event2 ↔ event1 forever.
   - Therefore Event1 does occur (in fact infinitely often). So C3 is true from the initial state.

3. C4: ""Event2 happens or C3 holds"".
   - At the initial state Event2 is true, and we already saw C3 holds, so C4 is true (indeed true in all states because C3 holds from every state as Event1 recurs).

4. C5: ""If C1 holds, then C4 holds"" i.e. ""If Event1 then (Event2 or eventually Event1)"".
   - Consider a state where Event1 does not hold (e.g. the initial state): antecedent false → implication true.
   - Consider a state where Event1 holds: Event2 is false in that same state, but ""eventually Event1"" is true (Event1 recurs), so the consequent (Event2 or eventually Event1) is true → implication true.
   - Thus C5 holds in every state reachable from the initial state.

Context summary:
- Initially event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen → once in event1, the system stays in event1 forever (event1 holds in every state along the trace).
- (The ""after event2, no other events can happen"" clause is irrelevant because we never reach event2 from the initial state.)

Evaluate the subformulas:

1. C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Given the context, event1 holds in the initial state and cannot be left, so event1 holds in every state. Therefore C1 is true.

2. C2: ""C1 always holds."" C1 itself is a global property that holds in every state, so ""always C1"" is also true (equivalently, always-always-event1 reduces to always-event1). Thus C2 is true.

3. C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Since C2 holds in all states, it holds in the next state as well, so C3 is true.

4. C4: ""C3 does not hold."" But C3 is true, so C4 is false.

5. C5: ""If C4 holds, then event1 happens."" This implication is evaluated at the initial state. Antecedent C4 is false, so the implication is vacuously true.

1. Context: initially event2 happened. After event2, no other events can happen. By the same interpretation used in the examples, that means once in a state with event2 the system stays in event2 forever (no transition to event1 or any other event). Similarly, after event1 no other events can happen would mean a state with event1 would be terminal, but event1 never occurs here.

2. So the actual infinite trace is: event2, event2, event2, ... (event1 never occurs).

3. Evaluate the conditions along that trace:
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" From any event2 state the next state is event2, so event1 does not happen next. Thus C1 is false in every state.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true in every state.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Because C2 is true in every state, C2 is true in the next state as well; hence C3 is true in every state.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" C3 holds in every state, so C4 is true (it holds now and forever).
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" Since C4 already holds at the initial state, C4 does eventually hold (immediately), so C5 is true.

2. C1: event2 or event1. True at S0 (event2) and true at S1+ (event1). So C1 holds (in particular at S0).

- C4: If C2 holds, then C3 holds. So C4 is (¬Event1) → Event1.

Step 2 — simplify C4:
(¬Event1) → Event1 is logically equivalent to Event1 (because p→q = ¬p ∨ q, so (¬E)→E = E ∨ E = E). Thus C4 ↔ Event1.

Context summary:
- Initial state: event2 is true.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so next state is event1).

1. C1: ""event1 or event2"".

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Initially event1 holds. ""After event1, event2 must happen"" implies the next state is event2.
2. ""After event2, no other events can happen"" implies once at event2 the system stays at event2 forever.
3. C1 (event2 in the next state) is true at the initial state (the next state is event2). C4 is the same as C1, so C4 is true.
4. C2 = (event2) OR (event2 in the next state). At the initial state C2 is true because C1 is true. At every later state event2 is true, so C2 holds in all states.
5. Therefore C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true, and together with C4 being true, C5 (C3 and C4) is true."

1. From the context: initial state = event2. After event2, event1 must happen, and after event1 no other events can happen. So the only possible run is: state0 = event2, state1 = event1, and thereafter event1 holds forever.

2. Simplify C1 and C3:
   - C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" is just event1 (redundant conjunction).
   - C3 is the same as C1, so also equivalent to event1.

3. C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" means eventually event1 holds. That is true: event1 holds at state1 (and thereafter). So C2 holds at the initial state and at all later states.

4. C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" Since C2 is true at every state, the implication reduces to C3. Thus C4 holds exactly in those states where event1 holds (i.e., from state1 onward) and does not hold at the initial event2 state.

5. C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" Because at state1 (the next state) event1 holds, so C4 holds at state1, hence C4 does occur eventually.

1. C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
   - At State0 event2 already holds, and ""eventually"" includes the current state. So C1 is true at State0.
   - At State1 (and thereafter) event2 will never happen again, so C1 is false there.

2. C2: ""C1 holds in the next state.""
   - At State0, next state is State1 where C1 is false → C2 is false at State0.
   - At State1, next state is State1 (stays event1) where C1 is false → C2 is false at State1 (and at all states).

3. C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" (C2 → event2)
   - Since C2 is false in every state, the implication is vacuously true in every state. So C3 holds in all states.

4. C4: ""C3 always holds.""
   - C3 is true in every state, so C4 (the global/always of C3) is true (holds immediately and everywhere).

5. C5: ""C4 eventually holds.""
   - C4 already holds at the initial state, so it eventually holds. Therefore C5 is true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. From the context the system runs: state0 = event1, state1 = event2, and then event2 forever.
2. C1 (""event1 in the next state""): false at state0 (next is event2) and false at all later states (no transition back to event1). So C1 is false everywhere.
3. C2 (""C1 does not hold""): negation of C1, hence true in every state.
4. C3 (""if event1 then C2""): since C2 is true everywhere, the implication holds in every state (true at state0 where event1 holds, vacuously true elsewhere).
5. C4 (""C3 eventually holds""): because C3 already holds at every state, C4 holds at every state.
6. C5 (""C4 always holds""): since C4 holds in every state, C5 is true."

1. Context summary:
   - Initially event2 is true.
   - After event2, event1 must happen (so next state after event2 is event1).
   - After event1, no other events can happen (so once at event1 it stays at event1).

2. Simplify the conditions:
   - C1: Event2 eventually happens.
   - C2: Event2 eventually happens (same as C1).
   - C3: C2 does not hold = not(C2).
   - C4: C3 does not hold = not(C3) = not(not(C2)) = C2.
   - C5: C1 holds and C4 holds = C2 and C2 = C2 (i.e., Event2 eventually happens).

3. Evaluate Event2 eventually happens:
   - Event2 is true in the initial state, so ""event2 eventually happens"" is satisfied (eventually includes the current state).

4. Therefore C2 is true, C1 is true, C4 is true, C3 is false, and C5 (C1 and C4) is true.

Step 2 — use the context:
- Initially event2 holds and after event2 no other events can happen ⇒ event1 never holds in any state.
- Thus Event1 is always false, so C1 is always false, and therefore C2 and C3 are always false.

Step 3 — evaluate C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds.""
- Since C2 and C3 are the same formula, C2 → C3 is a tautology.
- Also, because C2 is always false in this system, the implication C2 → C3 is true (false implies false is true).

Step 3 — Evaluate with the context
- In the initial state, event1 is true.
- Because after event1 no other events can happen, event2 never occurs, so C1 and C2 are false, and C3 is false.
- But event1 is true in the initial state, so C4 = (false or true) = true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Possible states given the context:
   - s0 (initial): event1
   - s1: event2
   - s2, s3, ...: event2 (event2 is terminal / self-loop)

2. Evaluate C1 = (event1 or event2):
   - C1 is true in every state (s0 has event1, s1+ have event2).

3. Evaluate C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" (i.e., C1(s_next)):
   - From any state the next state has event2, and C1 is true there, so C2 is true in every state.

4. Evaluate C3 = ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens"" (i.e., C2 -> event1):
   - Since C2 is true everywhere, C3 is equivalent to event1.
   - Thus C3 is true only in s0 and false in s1 and later.

5. Evaluate C4 = ""C3 holds in the next state"" (i.e., C3(s_next)):
   - From any state the next state is s1 or s2 where C3 is false, so C4 is false in every state.

6. Evaluate C5 = ""C4 does not hold"" (i.e., not C4):
   - Because C4 is false everywhere, C5 is true everywhere (including the initial state).

1. From the context: initially event2 is true. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 occurs it persists / no transition to a different event).

   - C2: event1 or event1, i.e. C2 ≡ event1.

1. Context: initially event2 is true.
2. After event2, no other events can happen — so once in event2 the system stays in event2 forever. Therefore event2 is true at the initial state and at all future states.
3. From (2), event1 never occurs (it cannot occur after the initial event2, and it is not true initially).

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context: initial state s0 has event1. ""After event1, event2 must happen"" means s1 must be event2. ""After event2, no other events can happen"" means once event2 occurs it persists forever (s1, s2, ... are event2).

- Sequence of states: s0: event1; s1: event2; s2: event2; ...

- Evaluate C1–C5:
  - C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" is ¬event2 (a state formula). True at s0, false at s1 and later.
  - C2: ""C1 always holds"" (globally ¬event2). This is false because s1 has event2.
  - C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens"" = (false) ∨ event1. So C3 is true at s0 (event1 true) but false at s1 and thereafter.
  - C4: ""C3 always holds"" is false because C3 fails at s1.
  - C5: ""C4 always holds"" is equivalent to C4 (nested always is the same), so it is false.

2. C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Evaluated at each state:
   - At s0 (event2): next state s1 has event1, so C1 is true at s0.
   - At s1 (event1): next state s2 has event2, so C1 is false at s1.
   Thus C1 is not true at every state.

3. C2 is the same as C1, so C3 = C1 ∧ C2 is equivalent to C1. Therefore C3 is true at s0 and false at s1.

4. C4: ""C3 always holds"" would require C3 to be true at every state. But C3 is false at s1 (and other odd states), so C4 is false.

2. C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" At the initial state (t0) event2 occurs at t1, so C1 is true at t0. Also true at later states because the sequence keeps alternating.

3. C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" At t0 this requires C1 to be true at t1. At t1 the sequence continues and event2 will occur again (at t3), so C1 is true at t1. Therefore C2 is true at t0.

4. C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" At t0 this requires C2 to be true at t1. At t1, C2 demands that C1 be true at t2; at t2 event2 will occur (at t3), so C1 is true at t2, hence C2 is true at t1. So C3 is true at t0.

1. Context: initially event1 is true. ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means once in an event1 state the system stays at event1 forever. So event1 holds in the initial state and in all future states. In particular, event2 never happens at any time.

2. C1: ""Event2 always happens."" This is false because event2 never occurs (initially we are at event1 and stay there).

Context summary:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so the system remains at event1 forever).
- The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never occurs.

Evaluate the hypotheses:
1. C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — equivalent to ""Event2 happens"". In the initial (and all) states event2 is false (event1 holds and the system stays at event1). So C1 is false.
2. C2 is identical to C1, so C2 is false.
3. C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" This is an implication C1 -> C2. Since C1 and C2 are the same formula, the implication is true (and in particular with C1 false the implication is true). So C3 holds.

Context gives an infinite alternating sequence starting from event1:
- initial state: event1 true.
- after event1 must come event2, after event2 must come event1, so states alternate: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

Now examine the conditions:

1. C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (event1 -> event1), so C1 is true in every state.

2. C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" Since C1 is always true, C2 is equivalent to ""event1 happens"" (i.e., C2 holds exactly in the event1 states).

3. C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" Replacing C2 with event1, C3 is equivalent to (event2 -> event1). In our model, in event2 states event1 is false, so C3 is false in every event2 state; in event1 states the implication is true.

4. C4: ""C3 does not hold."" That means not C3. C4 is true in event2 states (where C3 is false) and false in event1 states (where C3 is true).

5. C5: ""C4 always holds."" This requires C4 to be true in every state. But C4 is false in event1 states, so C5 is not satisfied.

Therefore C5 is False."

1. From the context:
   - Initially event2 holds.
   - After event2, event1 must happen (so next state after any event2-state is event1).
   - After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 holds, it holds forever — a self-loop on event1).
   - Implicitly, exactly one event holds in each state.

2. Therefore the only possible infinite trace is:
   - state0: event2
   - state1: event1
   - state2: event1
   - ...
   So event2 only holds at the initial state; event1 holds from state1 onward.

3. Evaluate the components:
   - C1: ""Event2 always happens"" — false (event2 fails at all states after the initial one).
   - C2: same as C1 — false.
   - C3: C1 and C2 — false.
   - C4: ""Event1 happens or C3 holds"" — since C3 is false, C4 reduces to ""Event1 happens"". That is false at the initial state (event2 holds there), so C4 is not true in every state.
   - C5: ""C4 always holds"" — false, because C4 fails at the initial state.

- Therefore in every state the next-state event is event1.
- C1 (event1 in the next state) is true in every state.
- C2 (C1 in the next state) is thus true in every state.
- C3 (C2 does not hold) is false in every state (since C2 is always true).

- C1 and C2 are the same: ""event2 does not happen"" (i.e., they are true exactly in the event1 states and false in the event2 states).
- C3 = ""C2 always holds"" means ""event2 never happens"" — this is false (event2 does happen).

2. So the whole hypothesis reduces to: ""Event1 happens.""

3. From the context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. Thus event1 is false in the initial state and can never occur later.

Reasoning (brief):
- Initial state: event2 is true, event1 is false.
- C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false (event1 is not true initially).
- C2 (""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"") is true in the current state because its antecedent (event1) is false, so the implication holds vacuously.
- C3 (""If C2 holds, then event2 happens""): C2 holds and event2 is true in the current state, so C3 is true.
- C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is therefore false in the current state.
- After event2 no other events can happen, so the next state is the same (event2 true, event1 false). The same evaluation applies there: C4 is false in the next state.
- Therefore C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"") is false."

Context (state graph):

- From s0, event2 -> event1 must happen, so next state s1: event1 = true, event2 = false.
- From s1, after event1 no other events can happen, so it stays at s1 forever.

Evaluate the conditions at the initial state s0 (we treat the formulas as state formulas unless a temporal operator is given):

C1: If event2 happens, then event1 happens (i.e. event2 -> event1).
- At s0: event2 is true and event1 is false, so C1 is false at s0.
- (At s1 C1 would be true, but we care about the initial state.)

C2: C1 holds or event2 happens (C1 ∨ event2).
- At s0: C1 is false but event2 is true, so C2 is true at s0.

C3: If event1 happens, then C2 holds (event1 -> C2).
- At s0: event1 is false, so the implication is true at s0.
- (At s1 event1 is true and C2 is true there, so C3 holds there as well.)

- After event1, no other events can happen (so the system stays in states where event1 holds forever).
- The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never occurs.

Evaluate the components:
1. C1: ""Event2 always happens"" — false, because the initial state has event1, not event2, and the system remains in event1 forever. So event2 does not always happen (in fact it never happens).
2. C2 is the same as C1, so also false.

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Timeline from the context:
  - S0 (initial): event1 = true, event2 = false.
  - After event1, event2 must happen → S1: event2 = true.
  - After event2, no other events can happen → all subsequent states S1, S2, ... have event2 = true.

- Evaluate the subconditions per state:
  - C1 (event1 → event2):
    - S0: false (event1 true, event2 false).
    - S1 onward: true (event1 false).
  - C2 (event2 ∨ C1):
    - S0: false.
    - S1 onward: true (event2 true).
  - C3 (C2 holds in the next state):
    - S0: true (C2 true in S1).
    - S1 onward: true (C2 true in the next state as well).
  - C4 (C3 → event2):
    - S0: false (C3 true but event2 false).
    - S1 onward: true (C3 true and event2 true).

- Initially event1 is true.
- After event1, event2 must happen; after event2, event1 must happen. So states alternate: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...
- At any single state only one event holds.

Step 2 — interpret the hypotheses
- C1, C2, C3 are the same propositional claim: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Interpreted as a same-state implication (event1 → event2) evaluated in the model.
- C4 = C2 or C3 (same as C1 or C1) so equivalent to C1.
- C5 = C1 and C4, hence equivalent to C1 and C1, i.e. C1.

Step 3 — evaluate C1
- In the initial state event1 is true but event2 is not (only one event per state). Thus the same-state implication event1 → event2 is false in that state.

Conclusion
- C1 is false, so C5 is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. From the context: initial state = event1. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, no other events can happen. So the trace is: event1 at time 0, then event2 at time 1, and event2 forever thereafter.
2. C1 and C4 are the same: ""Event2 always happens"" (i.e., from the current state onward, event2 holds in every state). That is false at the initial state because event1 holds initially, not event2.
3. C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"": there is a future state from which event2 holds in all future states. That is true (starting at time 1, event2 holds forever).
4. C3 = ""C2 eventually holds"": since C2 already holds at time 0 (because C1 holds at time 1), C3 is true.

- Initial state s0: event2.
- After event2, event1 must happen, and after event1, event2 must happen. So the execution alternates: s0: event2, s1: event1, s2: event2, s3: event1, ... forever.

Step 2 — evaluate C1 and C2 along the run:
- C1 = ""event2 in the next state"".
  - At s0 (event2), next is s1 (event1) → C1 is false at s0.
  - At s1 (event1), next is s2 (event2) → C1 is true at s1.
  - So C1 alternates: false, true, false, true, ...
- C2 = not C1, so C2 alternates the opposite: true, false, true, false, ...

Step 3 — evaluate C3 = ""C2 always holds"" (globally from the current state):
- From any state, because C2 alternates, there is always some future state where C2 is false. Hence ""always C2"" is false at every state. So C3 is false everywhere.

Step 4 — C4 = ""C3 always holds"":
- Since C3 is false at every state, C4 is false at every state.

- Because C4 is false at every state, there is no future state where C4 holds, so C5 is false.

Context dynamics:
- Initially event1 is true (state 0).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so state sequence alternates).
- After event2, event1 must happen.
Thus the system alternates: state0: event1, state1: event2, state2: event1, state3: event2, ...

Evaluate formulas by state (including current state when evaluating ""eventually""):

1. C1: ""Event2 always happens"" (globally). This is false because at states where event1 holds (e.g., the initial state) event2 is false. So C1 is false at every state.

2. C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" — since C1 is always false, C2 is true exactly at states where event2 is true (the odd states: 1, 3, 5, ...), and false at states where event1 is true (even states).

3. C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — from any state there is a future state with event2 (because the sequence alternates), so C2 will hold at some future (or current) state. Therefore C3 is true at every state.

4. C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" — since C3 is already true at every state, there certainly exists a (current) state where C3 holds, so C4 is true at every state.

   - C3 = C2 ∧ event2 (holds in the current state).
   - C4 = ""C3 always holds"" (globally true in every state).
   - C5 = ""C4 holds in the next state"" (i.e., evaluate C4 at the next state).

3. Evaluate C1 by state:
   - In an event1 state: event2 is false, so (event2 → event1) is true.
   - In an event2 state: event2 is true but event1 is false (events are mutually exclusive), so (event2 → event1) is false.
   Thus C1 is true in event1 states and false in event2 states.

4. C2 = ""C1 in the next state"":
   - In an event1 state, next state is event2, where C1 is false → C2 is false in event1 states.
   - In an event2 state, next state is event1, where C1 is true → C2 is true in event2 states.

5. C3 = C2 ∧ event2:
   - This is true exactly in event2 states that also have C2 true. From step 4, C2 is true in event2 states, so C3 is true in every event2 state.
   - C3 is false in every event1 state.

6. C4 = ""C3 always holds"" (globally):
   - Since C3 is false in event1 states, C4 is false (it does not hold in every state).

7. C5 = ""C4 holds in the next state"":
   - Because C4 is false globally, C4 is false in every state, so C4 is false in the next state of the initial state as well.
   - Therefore C5 is false.

2. C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" From the initial state s0 (event1), the next state s1 is event1, so C1 is true at s0. C2 is the same as C1, so also true.

3. C3: ""C1 or C2"" is therefore true at s0.

4. C4: ""C3 does not hold"" is false at s0 (negation of the true C3).

5. C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" asks whether C4 is true at s1. But s1's next state s2 is also event1, so C1 (and thus C3) is true at s1, hence C4 is false at s1. Therefore C5 is false at s0.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Initial state: event1.
2. From event1, event2 must happen in the next state. So state1 = event2.
3. From event2 no other events can happen, so all future states are event2.
4. C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" — at the initial state the next state is event2, so C1 is false. C2 is identical, so false.
5. C3 = C1 or C2 = false.
6. C4 = ""always C3"" is false at any state where C3 is false; since C3 is false at the next state (and at the initial state too), C4 is false.

1. Context gives the trace: initially event2; then must go to event1; thereafter event1 is absorbing. So states: initial (event2 = true), next (event1 = true), and event1 stays true forever.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context: initially event1 holds, and ""after event1, no other events can happen."" As in the examples, that means the only possible next state after event1 is event1 again (it stays at event1). So event2 never occurs anywhere in the run.

2. C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This implication is tautologically true in any state (p -> p).

3. C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is always true, C2 is false.

4. C3: ""Event2 happens and C2 holds."" C2 is false, so C3 is false.

5. C4: ""C3 holds or event2 happens."" With C3 false, C4 is equivalent to ""event2 happens.""

6. C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" — equivalently, ""event2 holds in the next state."" But from the initial state the next state remains event1 (event2 never happens), so event2 is false in the next state.

   - If the current state is event1, the next state is event2, so C1 is true.

Context summary:
- Initial state: event2 is true.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
Thus the system alternates: event2, event1, event2, event1, ... forever. In particular, event2 occurs infinitely often.

Hypotheses:
- C1: Event2 eventually happens.
- C2: Event2 eventually happens. (same as C1)
- C3: C1 holds or C2 holds → equivalent to ""Event2 eventually happens"".
- C4: C3 holds in the next state.
- C5: C4 does not hold.

Evaluate:
1. From the initial state (event2), event2 also occurs again later (the sequence alternates), so ""Event2 eventually happens"" is true at the initial state.
2. Consider the next state (where event1 is true). From that state, by the rules, event2 must happen in the following state — so ""Event2 eventually happens"" is true in the next state as well.
3. Therefore C3 holds in the next state, so C4 is true.
4. C5 asserts that C4 does not hold, but we just found C4 is true. Hence C5 is false.

Reasoning (step by step):

1. Context: initially event2 holds, and both event1 and event2 are terminal (after either one, no other events can happen). So the system starts in a state with event2 true and never reaches event1.

2. C1 and C2 are the same: ""event1 implies event2"". These implications are vacuously true in any state where event1 does not hold.

3. C3 = (C2 holds) AND event1. Because C2 is an implication, C3 simplifies to event1 AND event2 (if event1 holds, C2 requires event2 as well). So C3 requires event1 and event2 to be true simultaneously in some state.

4. Given the context, event1 never occurs (we start at event2 and no transitions are possible), so event1 is false in all states. Therefore C3 is false in every state.

5. C4 = C1 AND C3. Since C3 is false, C4 is false in every state.

6. C5 = ""C4 always holds"" requires C4 to be true in all states, but C4 is false. Thus C5 is False."

1. From the context: initially event1, and the rules ""after event1, event2 must happen"" and ""after event2, event1 must happen"" force an infinite alternation: event1, event2, event1, event2, ... (exactly one event true in each state).

2. C1 is ""event2 AND event1"" (both in the same state). In this model only one event holds per state, so C1 is false in every state.

3. C2 is ""if event1 happens, then C1 holds"" (event1 ⇒ C1). At any state where event1 is true, the consequent C1 is false, so the implication is false at those states. Thus C2 is false at every event1 state and true at event2 states.

4. Because event1 occurs infinitely often (every other state), C2 does not hold in all states. So C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false.

5. C4 is ""C3 always holds"" — since C3 is false, C4 is false.

6. C5 is ""eventually C4 holds."" Since C4 is false in every state and there is no future point from which C3 (hence C4) would become true (the alternation continues forever), C4 never becomes true; thus C5 is false.

- After event2 must come event1, and after event1 must come event2.
- So the system alternates: s0: event2, s1: event1, s2: event2, s3: event1, ... (forever alternating).

Evaluate the formulas:

1. C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
   - At s0 the next state s1 has event1, so C1 is true at s0.
   - In general, C1 is true exactly in states whose successor is an event1 state (i.e., in event2 states).

2. C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds.""
   - This requires event1 now AND event1 in the next state.
   - But states alternate event1/event2, so you can never have event1 in two consecutive states.
   - Therefore C2 is false in every state (never holds).

3. C3: ""C2 holds in the next state.""
   - Since C2 never holds, C3 is false in every state.

4. C4: ""C3 does not hold.""
   - Because C3 is false everywhere, C4 is true in every state.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initial state: event1 is true. From the rules, states alternate: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...
- C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is false (event1 does happen, in fact infinitely often).
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.

- C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is therefore true (negation of a false statement).
- C5 is the conjunction ""Event2 happens AND C4 holds"". Evaluated at the initial state (as in the examples), event2 does not happen initially, so the conjunction is false (even though C4 is true and event2 occurs at later states). Hence C5 is False."

1. System behavior:
- State 0 (initial): event1 is true.
- After event1, event2 must happen → State 1: event2 is true, event1 false.
- After event2, no other events can happen → from State 1 onward event2 stays true forever.

2. Simplify the propositions:
- C1 = event1 OR event2.
- C2 = event2 OR C1 = event2 OR (event1 OR event2) = event1 OR event2 (so C2 ≡ C1).
- C3 = NOT C2 = NOT(event1 OR event2) (means neither event1 nor event2 holds).
- C4 = C3 OR event1 = NOT(event1 OR event2) OR event1. This simplifies to (event1) OR (NOT event2 AND NOT event1) which is equivalent to event1 OR (NOT event2). Another simpler form: C4 ≡ event1 OR ¬event2.
- C5 = ""C4 always holds"" (i.e., C4 must be true in every state).

3. Evaluate C4 along the trace:
- State 0: event1 = true, event2 = false → C4 = true.
- State 1 and onward: event1 = false, event2 = true → C4 = false (since event1 false and ¬event2 false).

4. Since there are states (from State 1 onward) where C4 is false, C4 is not always true. Therefore C5 is false.

Context summary:
- Initially event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so the system stays at event1 forever).
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant here because event2 never occurs).

Evaluate the conditions:

1. C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" At the initial state event1 is true and event2 is false, and since the system stays at event1 forever, event2 never happens. So C1 is true (it holds in the initial state and all future states).

2. C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" The next state is also event1, where event2 does not happen, so C1 holds in the next state. Thus C2 is true (already true at the initial state).

3. C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 holds immediately, C3 is true.

4. C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" C3 is true, so C4 is true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. C1 is ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens"" — that is an implication p -> p, which is a tautology and therefore true in every state.

2. C2 is ""C1 holds in the next state."" Since C1 is true in every state, C1 is true in the next state as well, so C2 is true in every state.

3. C3 is ""C2 eventually holds."" Because C2 already holds now (and everywhere), C3 is true.

4. C4 is ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is true, C4 is false.

5. C5 is ""Event2 happens and C4 holds."" Although event2 is true in the initial state, C4 is false, so the conjunction is false.

1. Initially event2 is true. After event2, no other events can happen — so from the initial state all future states remain with event2 true, and event1 can never occur (there is no transition to event1).
2. C1 = (event1 and event2). That requires event1 and event2 to hold simultaneously in some state. Given the context (event2 holds initially and no other events can happen afterward), event1 never holds, so C1 is always false.
3. C2 = (C1 or event1). Since C1 is false and event1 never happens, C2 is false.
4. C3 = (event1 and event2) — same as C1 — so C3 is false.

- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" simplifies to: event2 happens (in the current state).
- C2 is identical to C1, so also simplifies to event2 happens.
- C3: C1 holds and C2 holds therefore also simplifies to event2 happens.

Step 3 — evaluate under the context:

- Initially event2 is true.
- After event2, no other events can happen → once in a state with event2, all future states remain event2.
- After event1, event2 must happen (irrelevant because event1 never occurs given the previous rule).

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Context: Initially event2; after event2 no other events can happen. Therefore the system stays at event2 forever (event1 never occurs). The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant because event1 never happens.

2. C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — redundant, equivalent to ""event2 happens"". This holds in the initial state and in every subsequent state (since the system remains at event2).

3. C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 already holds immediately (and forever), C2 is true.

4. C3: ""C2 always holds."" From every state along the run, C1 holds (hence C2 holds), so C2 holds at all times. Thus C3 is true.

5. C4: ""C3 holds and event1 happens."" C3 holds, but event1 never happens (no transition from event2), so C4 is false.

6. C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" Since C4 is false now and will never become true, C5 is false.

Therefore C5 is False."

1. Context: initial state has event2. Then the next state must be event1. After event1, no other events can happen (it stays at event1 thereafter). So the only states in any run are:
   - state0: event2 true
   - state1 and onward: event1 true, event2 false

2. C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" C2 is the same. So C3 = C1 and C2 is equivalent to ""Event2 does not happen.""

3. C4 is the implication: if event1 happens, then C3 holds. That is, (event1) -> (event2 does not happen).

4. In every state where event1 happens (state1 and later), event2 is false (only one event true per state and after event2 the system moves to event1). So the consequent of the implication is true whenever the antecedent is true. In the initial state the antecedent is false, so the implication is vacuously true there. Therefore C4 holds in all states (i.e., C4 is true).

5. C5 asserts ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 does hold, C5 is false.

- After event1, no other events can happen (so once at event1, all future states remain event1).
- The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never occurs given the above.

1. Context: initially event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, event1 must happen. So the system alternates: state0: event1, state1: event2, state2: event1, etc.
2. C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" At the initial state this is false (initially event1 happened).
3. C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" — equivalently ""(not event1) or event2"". At the initial state both not event1 and event2 are false, so C2 is false at the initial state.

1. From the context, the system alternates starting with event1:
   - state0: event1
   - state1: event2 (must follow event1)
   - state2: event1 (must follow event2)
   - state3: event2, ...
   So the infinite trace is event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

2. Simplify the conditions:
   - C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" => C1 ≡ event1.
   - C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" => event1 → C1. Since C1 ≡ event1, C2 is event1 → event1, which is a tautology (true in every state).
   - C3: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" => C3 ≡ event1.
   - C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds"" => C4 ≡ (true) ∧ event1 => C4 ≡ event1.
   - C5: ""C4 always holds"" => Always(event1), i.e., event1 must be true in every state.

3. Check C5 against the trace: event1 is false in the event2 states, so event1 is not true in every state. Therefore Always(event1) is false.

1. Context: s0 (initial) has event2 true. After event2, event1 must happen, so s1 has event1 true. After event1, no other events can happen, so from s1 onward the system stays in states with event1 true (s1, s2, ...). Thus event2 is true only at s0; event1 is true from s1 onward.

2. C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Evaluate:
   - At s0, next state s1 has event2 = false → C1 false at s0.
   - At s1 and thereafter, next states also have event2 = false → C1 false everywhere.
   So C1 is always false.

3. C3 is the same as C1, so C3 is also always false.

4. C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Since C1 is always false, C2 is false in every state (even where event1 is true, C1 is false).

5. C4: ""C2 or C3"" = false or false = false in every state.

Reasoning:
1. The system starts in a state where event1 is true, and after event1 no other events can happen (so it stays at event1 forever).
2. C1 is the formula ""if event1 happens then event1 happens"" — this is true in every state (in particular true in the initial state where event1 holds).
3. Therefore C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true immediately (C1 holds now).
4. Consequently C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true (C2 holds now).
5. Consequently C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true (C3 holds now).
6. C5 is ""C4 does not hold"". Since C4 does hold, C5 is false."
