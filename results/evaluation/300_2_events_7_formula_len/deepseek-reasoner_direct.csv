- The context states that event1 happened initially, and after event1, no other events can happen. This means event2 cannot occur because if it did, event1 would need to happen after event2, but that is impossible after the initial event1.
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" is True because event2 cannot occur.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" is False because C1 is True.
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds"" is True because event2 never happens, making the implication vacuously true.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" is True because C3 is always true.
- C5: ""If event2 happens, then C4 holds"" is True because event2 never happens, making the implication vacuously true.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold"" is False because C5 is True.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold"" is True because C6 is False.

- C3 states ""C1 always holds,"" which is also true for the same reason as C2.

- The context states that event1 happened initially, and after event2, event1 must happen, and after event1, event2 must happen. This implies that both events occur alternately in a cycle, so event1 and event2 both happen repeatedly.

- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens"" is always true because both events occur in the sequence.

- C2: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens"" is identical to C1 and thus always true.

- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds"" is always true because event2 happens and C2 is always true.

- C4: ""C3 always holds"" is true because C3 is always true.

- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" is false because C4 is true.

- C6: ""C5 holds and event2 happens"" is false because C5 is false, and false combined with any other value (event2 happens is true) is false.

- C7: ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds"" is false because C1 is true and C6 is false, resulting in true implies false, which is false.

- The context states that initially event2 happened, and after event2, event1 must happen. After event1, event2 must happen, creating a cycle where both events occur repeatedly.
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" – This holds true after the first event1 occurs, as both events have happened.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"" – This is true because if C1 holds, event1 has already occurred, so the implication is valid.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" – Since C2 is true at all times (even before C1 holds, the implication is vacuously true), C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" – Since C3 is true, C4 is false.
- C5: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"" – This is identical to C2 and is true.
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds"" – Since C4 is false and C5 is true, the conjunction is false.
