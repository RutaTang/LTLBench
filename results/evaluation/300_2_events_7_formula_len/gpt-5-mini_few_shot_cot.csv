Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context the system alternates events starting with event2: s0 = event2, s1 = event1, s2 = event2, s3 = event1, ...

2. Simplify the named conditions:
   - C1: ""Event1 or event1"" simplifies to Event1.
   - C2: same, simplifies to Event1.
   - C3: ""Event1 or C2"" → Event1.
   - C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" → next state's Event1.
   - C5: ""C4 does not hold"" → next state's Event1 is false.
   - Given alternation, C4 is true exactly at states with current event2 (their next is event1), so C5 is true exactly at states with current event1. Thus C5 ≡ Event1.
   - C6: ""If event1 happens, then C5 holds"" becomes Event1 → Event1, which is always true.
3. C7: ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds"" is Event1 → (Event1 → Event1). That is equivalent to Event1 → Event1, i.e., a tautology, so C7 holds in every state.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. The system starts in a state where event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. Therefore event1 never occurs in any reachable state.
2. C1, C2, C3 are all ""Event1 does not happen"" — each is true (in the initial state and all future states).
3. C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is true because the next state is also event2 (so event1 does not happen there).
4. C5 (""If C4 holds, then event2 happens"") is true in the current state: C4 is true and event2 does happen.
5. C6 (""C2 holds or C5 holds"") is true because C2 already holds.
6. Therefore, whenever C1 holds (which it does), C6 holds. So C7 (""If C1 holds, then C6 holds"") is true."

1. From the context: initially event2, and transitions force alternation: after event2 must be event1, after event1 must be event2. So the system alternates ... event2, event1, event2, event1, ...
2. Therefore event1 occurs at the next state and infinitely often. So C1 (""Event1 eventually happens"") is True at the initial state (and indeed at every state).
3. C2 is ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 already holds at the initial state (and at every state), C2 is True.

Reasoning (step-by-step, concise):

- From the context: initially event1 happens, and ""after event1, no other events can happen."" So once in event1 we stay in event1 forever. Therefore event2 never occurs in any state.
- C1 and C2 are both ""event2 happens in the next state"" — they are false everywhere (since event2 never occurs).
- C3 = C2 or event2 = (event2 in next state) or (event2 now). Both disjuncts are always false, so C3 is false everywhere.
- C4 = ""C3 always holds"" is false (because C3 is false).
- C5 = C1 or C4 = false or false = false (in every state).
- C6 = ""C5 always holds"" is false (since C5 is false).
- C7 says ""C6 does not hold"" — this is true because C6 is false.

1. Context implies a strict alternation: initially event1, and after event1 must come event2, and after event2 must come event1. So the reachable trace is event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

3. C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" Since C1 is always true, C2 is equivalent to ""event2 happens"" — i.e., C2 holds exactly in the event2 states.

4. C3 is the same as C2, so C3 also holds exactly in the event2 states.

5. C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" Given C3 ≡ event2, C4 holds in a state iff the next state is an event2 state.

1. Timeline from the context: S0: event2. S1 and onward: event1 (and it stays event1 forever).

2. C1 and C2 are ""event2 does not happen"" — false at S0, true at S1+.

3. C3 is (if C2 then event1). At S0 the antecedent C2 is false → C3 true vacuously. At S1+ C2 is true and event1 is true → C3 true. So C3 holds at all states.

4. C4 is (if event2 then C3). At S0 event2 holds and C3 holds, so C4 holds; at S1+ event2 is false so C4 holds vacuously. Thus C4 holds at all states.

5. Therefore C5 (always C4) and C6 (always C5) both hold.

Context summary:
- Initially event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 would also be terminal).
Thus the system starts in a state where event1 holds and no future state with any other event (including event2) is reachable.

Evaluate the propositions:

1. C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
   - From the context, event2 never occurs (we start at event1 and no further events can happen). So C1 is False.

2. C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds.""
   - Requires event2 to happen (which it does not). So C2 is False.

3. C3: same as C2, so False.

4. C4: ""If C3 holds, then event1 happens.""
   - C3 is False, so the implication is vacuously True. So C4 is True.

5. C5: ""C2 holds and C4 holds.""
   - C2 is False, so C5 is False (conjunction with C4 True still yields False).

6. C6: ""If C5 holds, then event2 happens.""
   - C5 is False, so this implication is vacuously True.

Therefore C6 is True.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. Therefore event1 holds in the initial state and in all future states; event2 never happens.

2. C1, C2, C4 are ""Event1 does not happen"" — each is false because event1 does happen (always).

3. C3 is ""Event2 happens or C2 holds"". Event2 never happens and C2 is false, so C3 is false.

4. C5 is ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds"" (C3 ⇒ C4). Because C3 is false, this implication is vacuously true, so C5 is true.

5. C6 is ""Event2 happens and C5 holds"". Event2 is false, so C6 is false.

6. C7 is ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds"" (C1 ⇒ C6). Since C1 is false, the implication is vacuously true.

Therefore C7 is True."

  - C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (F C1) — true, because C1 already holds at the initial state.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Timeline from context: s0 = event2 (initial) -> s1 = event1 (because after event2, event1 must happen) -> s2 = event1 -> ... (event1 is absorbing: no other events can happen).

2. C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (always true) in every state.

3. C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" Since C1 always holds, C2 is equivalent to ""event1 happens."" So C2 is true exactly in states where event1 holds (s1, s2, ...).

4. C3: same as C2 (C1 and event1), so C3 ≡ event1 as well.

5. C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" Since C2 and C3 are equivalent (both are event1), this implication is always true in every state. So C4 always holds.

6. C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" Because C4 is always true, C5 holds in any state that has a next state. In particular, at s0 (initial event2) the next state s1 exists and C4 holds there, so C5 is true at s0. It also holds at s1, s2, ...

7. C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" Since C5 already holds at the initial state (s0), C6 is true.

Therefore C6 is True."

3. C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e. globally, event1 never happens). This is false, because event1 does happen at the initial state.
4. C3: same as C2, so C3 is also false.
5. C4: same as C1; C4 is false at the initial state (true later).
6. C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds"" — since C3 is false, C5 is false.
7. C6: ""If C2 holds, then C5 holds"" — an implication with a false antecedent (C2 is false) is true.

Therefore C6 is True.

Context summary:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. C1, C2, and C6 are the same proposition: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" (next(event2)).
2. C3 is ""C2 holds in the next state"", i.e. next(next(event2)).
3. C4 = C1 AND C3 = next(event2) AND next(next(event2)).
4. C5 = C4 AND event1 = event1 AND next(event2) AND next(next(event2)).
5. Therefore C5 already includes next(event2), which is exactly C6.
6. So whenever C5 holds, C6 holds as well — the implication C5 ⇒ C6 is logically valid. (Even if C5 never actually holds in any run, the implication is still true vacuously.)

Thus C7 is True."

3. C3: C2 always holds (G C2). Since C2 is true in every state, C3 is true.

4. C4: C3 holds in the next state (X C3). Because C3 is globally true, it holds in the next state as well, so C4 is true in every state.

5. C5: eventually C4 (F C4). Since C4 already holds now (indeed in every state), F C4 is true everywhere.

6. C6: C5 always holds (G C5). Because C5 holds in every state, C6 is true.

7. C7: C6 holds in the next state (X C6). As C6 is global, it holds in the next state too, so C7 is true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- System behavior: initially event2. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, no other events can happen (so once at event1 the system stays at event1).

- C1 and C2: both are ""Event2 eventually happens."" At the initial state event2 has happened, so C1 and C2 are true at the initial state.

- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 already holds initially, C3 is true.

- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" That is false at the initial state (negation of true).

- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" The next state is event1. From event1 no further events occur, so C2 is false there, hence C3 is false there, so C4 is true in that next state. Thus C5 is true at the initial state.

- C6: ""If C1 holds, then C5 holds."" At the initial state C1 is true and C5 is true, so the implication holds. At any later state (the system is at event1), C1 is false (event2 will not occur), so the implication is vacuously true there. Therefore C6 holds in every reachable state.

- C7: ""C6 always holds."" From the above, C6 indeed holds in all states, so C7 is True."

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. So the system stays at event1 forever — event2 never occurs.

2. C1 and C2 (""Event2 eventually happens"") are therefore false.

3. C3 (C1 and C2) is false.

4. C4 (if C3 holds then event2 happens) is vacuously true because C3 is false.

5. C5 (if event2 happens then C4 holds) is true because its consequent C4 is true (an implication with a true consequent is true).

6. C6 (""C5 holds in the next state"") is true: the next state exists (it is event1 again) and C5 holds there as well.

7. C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is true because C6 already holds in the initial state, so it holds eventually.

Context summary:
- Initially event2 is true.
- After event2, no other events can happen — so once event2 occurs, the system stays in states where event2 continues to hold forever.

From this, event2 holds in the initial state and in every future state (i.e., event2 always holds).

Evaluate the claims:
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" True (as just reasoned).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Since C1 is true in all states, it certainly holds in the next state. So C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" C2 is true in every state (because C1 is global), so C3 is true.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens."" C3 does hold, and event2 does happen, so the implication is true. Thus C4 is true.

Context summary:
- Initial state: event1 is true, event2 is false.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so the next state has event2 true).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so from that point on, event2 stays true forever).

Interpret the hypotheses (all evaluated as state formulas unless qualified by ""always""/""eventually""):
- C1: event2 does not happen = ¬event2.
- C2: If C1 holds, then event2 happens = (¬event2) -> event2. This is logically equivalent to event2 (because (¬p -> p) ≡ p).
- C3: C2 always holds = ""event2 holds in every state"".
- C4: same as C2, i.e. equivalent to event2.
- C5: If C3 holds, then C4 holds = (C3 -> C4). If C3 is true then C4 is true; if C3 is false the implication is true anyway. So C5 is true in any state where that implication evaluates true.
- C6: C5 eventually holds = there exists a state (now or later) where C5 is true.

Evaluate in the given run:
- Initial state: event2 is false, so C1 true in the initial state. C2 (equivalently event2) is false initially, so C3 (""C2 always"") is false.
- C5 = (C3 -> C4) is true in the initial state because C3 is false (a false antecedent makes the implication true).
- Therefore C5 already holds at the initial state, hence ""eventually C5 holds"" (C6) is true.

1. The system behavior from the context: starting state s0 has event2. After event2 must come event1, and after event1 must come event2. So the state sequence is an infinite alternation: s0: event2, s1: event1, s2: event2, s3: event1, ...

2. Evaluate C1 (event1 -> event2) at each state:
   - At any event2 state (s0, s2, ...): event1 is false (and event2 true), so the implication holds -> C1 is True.
   - At any event1 state (s1, s3, ...): event1 is true but event2 is false in that same state, so the implication is False -> C1 is False.

3. C2 = C1 OR event1. Check per state:
   - At event2 states: C1 is True, so C2 is True.
   - At event1 states: C1 is False but event1 is True, so C2 is True.
   Thus C2 is True at every state (a global tautology in this trace).

6. C5 = ""C4 holds in the next state"" (X C4). Since C4 is True in every state, X C4 is True in every state, so C5 is True everywhere.

7. C6 = C5 AND event2. Since C5 is True everywhere, C6 is exactly those states where event2 holds — i.e., s0, s2, s4, ...

8. C7 = ""C6 eventually holds"" (F C6). From the initial state s0 we already have C6 true (s0 is an event2 state and C5 is true), so C6 holds immediately; hence C7 is True.

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. System trace: states alternate forever starting from initial state s0:
   - s0: event1
   - s1: event2
   - s2: event1
   - s3: event2
   - … (because after event1 must come event2, and after event2 must come event1)

2. Only one event is true in any given state (events are mutually exclusive).

3. C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Interpreting this as a state formula (event1 → event2 in the same state).
   - At s0 (event1 true, event2 false) C1 is false. So C1 does not hold in general.

4. C6 is the same as C1, so C6 is also false at s0 and does not hold generally.

5. C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" At s0 C1 is false and event2 is false, so C2 is false at s0. At s1, C1 is true (because event1 is false so the implication holds) and event2 is true, so C2 is true at s1. But C2 is not true at the following state s2 (where event1 holds and C1 fails), so C2 is not persistent.

6. C3: ""C2 always holds."" Because C2 fails at s0 (and at every state where event1 occurs), C3 is false in every state — there is no point from which C2 holds at all future states.

7. C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Since C3 is never true at any state, C4 is false.

8. C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Because C4 is false, C5 is true.

9. C7: ""C5 holds or C6 holds."" C5 is true (step 8), so the disjunction C7 is true regardless of C6.

3. C4 is the implication ""if C2 then C3"". Since C2 is false, the implication is true (false antecedent implies the implication holds). So C4 is true (in every state).

4. C5 is ""C4 eventually holds"". Because C4 already holds, C5 is true.

Context summary:
- Initially event1 holds.
- After event1, no other events can happen → the system stays at event1 forever.
- (The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never occurs.)

Evaluate the conditions:

1. C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""  
   — Event2 never occurs (we stay at event1), so C1 is False.

2. C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds.""  
   — This implication is vacuously true on every reachable state: event2 never occurs, and if it did, that occurrence would make C1 true. So C2 is True (in all states).

3. C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds.""  
   — C2 holds, so C3 is True.

4. C4: ""Event2 eventually happens.""  
   — Same as C1, so C4 is False.

5. C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds.""  
   — C3 is True and C4 is False, so the implication is False. Thus C5 is False (in all states).

6. C6: ""C5 does not hold.""  
   — Since C5 is False, C6 is True.

7. C7: ""C6 always holds.""  
   — C6 is True in the initial state and remains True in every subsequent state (the system stays at event1), so C7 is True.

1. From the context the system alternates deterministically: s0 = event2, s1 = event1, s2 = event2, s3 = event1, ... (after event2 must come event1; after event1 must come event2).

2. Interpret formulas with Next (X):
   - C1 = X(event2) (event2 in the next state).
   - C2 = X(C1) = X^2(event2).
   - C3 = C2 AND event2 = event2 AND X^2(event2).
   - C4 = C3 OR event2 = event2 OR (event2 AND X^2(event2)) — this simplifies to just event2.
   - C5 = X(event2) (same as C1).
   - C6 = (C4 -> C5) = (event2 -> X(event2)).
   - C7 = ""eventually C6"" (◇C6).

3. Evaluate along the alternating trace:
   - At s0 (event2): event2 is true, X(event2) is false (since s1 is event1), so C6 = (true -> false) = false.
   - At s1 (event1): event2 is false, so C6 = (false -> X(event2)) = true.
   - Thus C6 is true at s1 (and at every event1 state), false at every event2 state.

4. Since from the initial state s0 we reach s1 where C6 is true, C6 holds eventually. Therefore C7 is true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Timeline from the context:
   - State0: initially event2.
   - After event2, event1 must happen → State1: event1.
   - After event1, no other events can happen → it stays at event1 forever (State1, State2, ... all event1).

2. Interpret formulas as state formulas:
   - C1 (and C6) is the implication: event1 → event2 (i.e., not event1 or event2).
   - C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" = ¬(event1 → event2) = event1 ∧ ¬event2.
   - C3 is ""C2 eventually holds"": some future state has event1 ∧ ¬event2.
   - C4 = ¬C3.
   - C5 = ¬C4 = C3.
   - C7 = C5 ∧ C6.

3. Evaluate on the timeline:
   - From State1 onward, event1 is true and event2 is false, so event1 ∧ ¬event2 holds in those states.
   - Thus C2 holds in State1 and so C3 (""eventually C2"") is true.
   - Therefore C4 = false and C5 = true.
   - C6 (event1 → event2) at the initial state (State0) is true because event1 is false there (implication with false antecedent is true). Even if considered at State0, C6 is true; as a formula, it does not prevent C2 from becoming true later.

2. Simplify C1: ""Event2 and event2"" is just Event2 (E2).

3. C2 is (C1 -> Event1) i.e. (E2 -> E1). At the initial state E1 is true (so E2 is false), hence the implication holds at the initial state. So C2 is true initially. C3 is the same as C2, so C3 is also true at E1 states.

4. C4 is (C3 -> Event2). Evaluate by state:
   - At an E1 state: C3 is true and Event2 is false, so C4 is false.
   - At an E2 state: C3 is false (since E2 true and E1 false), so the implication C4 is true.
   Thus C4 holds at every E2 state.

Reasoning (concise):
- The system starts in event2, and after event2 no other events can happen, so the trace is event2, event2, event2, ...
- C1 = ""event2 in the next state"". From the initial state the next state is event2, so C1 is true now.

- C3 is the same as C2, so C3 is true.
- C4 = X C3 (C3 holds in the next state). Because the trace is all event2, C3 holds at every state, so C4 is true now.

1. Context summary:
   - Initially event1 is true.
   - After event1, no other events can happen → event1 is absorbing (every next state also has event1).
   - After event2, event1 must happen → if event2 ever occurred, the next state would be event1.

2. Interpret atomic propositions as state properties (only one event true per state). So ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" means both are true in the same state, which is impossible.

3. Evaluate the conditions:
   - C1: event2 AND event1 — impossible in any state → C1 is always false.
   - C2: same as C1 → always false.
   - C3: C2 does not hold → since C2 is false, C3 is true in every state.
   - C4: C3 holds in the next state → true (C3 true everywhere).

   - C6: eventually C5 → false (C5 never becomes true).

- From event2 it stays at event2 (no other events can happen).

3. C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" (F C2). Because C2 already holds at the initial state, F C2 is true (it holds now), so C3 is true (indeed C3 holds in every state).

4. C4: ""C3 holds and event2 happens."" Since C3 holds everywhere, C4 is true exactly in those states where event2 is true. In the given trace, C4 is false at the initial state (event1) and true at every subsequent state (event2 states).

5. C5: ""C4 always holds"" (G C4). G C4 is false at the initial state because C4 is false there (initial state is event1). So C5 does not hold.

6. C6: ""C5 does not hold"" (¬C5). Since C5 is false, C6 is true (already true at the initial state).

Context summary:
- Initial state: event1.
- Transition rules: after event1 → event2; after event2 → event1.
Thus the system alternates deterministically: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

Understand the claims:
1. C1: event2 AND event1 (both hold in the same state). Because only one event holds per state, C1 is false in every state.
2. C2: event2 OR C1. Since C1 is always false, C2 is equivalent to ""event2"" — true exactly in the event2 states, false in the event1 states.
3. C3: C2 holds in the next state. Given alternation:
   - From an event1 state, the next state is event2, so C2 is true there → C3 is true in event1 states.
   - From an event2 state, the next state is event1, so C2 is false there → C3 is false in event2 states.
   In particular, C3 is true at the initial state (initial is event1).
4. C4: Eventually C3. Since C3 already holds in the initial state and recurs every other state, C4 is true in every state.
5. C5: C4 holds in the next state. Because C4 holds everywhere, C5 is true in every state.

1. From the context: the system starts at event1 and must alternate: state0 = event1, state1 = event2, state2 = event1, etc. So at any state exactly one of event1 or event2 holds, alternately.

2. C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" simplifies to event2 (redundant conjunction). So C1 is true exactly in states where event2 holds (every odd state).

3. C2 is identical to C1, so C2 ≡ event2.

4. C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens"" is event2 AND event1 in the same state. That cannot occur (states are either event1 or event2, not both), so C3 is false in every state.

5. C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens"" is an implication with a always-false antecedent, so C4 is vacuously true in every state.

6. C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" Since C4 holds in every state, it also holds in every next state; hence C5 is true in every state.

7. C6: ""C5 holds or event1 happens."" C5 is always true, so C6 is true in every state.

8. C7: ""C1 holds or C6 holds."" C6 always holds, so C7 holds in every state.

Context summary:
- Initially event1 holds.
- After event1, no other events can happen → from event1 the system stays at event1 forever.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so if event2 ever occurred, the next state would be event1). But event2 never occurs here because we start in event1 and remain in event1.

Evaluate the claims:

1. C1: ""Event2 always happens"" (i.e., in every state event2). This is false because the initial state has event1, not event2.
2. C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true (the negation of a false statement).
3. C3: ""C2 always holds."" C2 is a global fact about C1 (C1 is false), and that fact does not change over time, so C2 is true in every state. Therefore C3 is true.
4. C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" Since C3 is true in every state, it also holds in the next state. So C4 is true.
5. C5: ""Event1 happens or C4 holds."" The initial state has event1, so C5 is true.
6. C6: ""C5 holds and event1 happens."" Both conjuncts are true, so C6 is true.
7. C7: ""C6 holds and event1 happens."" Again both hold, so C7 is true.

Context timeline: initially event2. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, no other events can happen (so it stays event1 thereafter). So the possible sequence is: state0: event2, state1: event1, state2+: event1,...

Simplify the hypothesis:
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" ≡ event1.
- C2: C1 does not hold ≡ ¬event1.
- C3: C2 does not hold ≡ ¬(¬event1) ≡ event1.
- C4: C3 holds and event2 happens ≡ event1 ∧ event2.
- C5: C1 does not hold ≡ ¬event1.
- C6: If C4 holds, then C5 holds ≡ (event1 ∧ event2) → ¬event1.

Observe that in any single state at most one event holds, so event1 ∧ event2 is impossible — C4 is false in every state. An implication with a false antecedent is always true. Therefore C6 is true in this model.

Context gives the state sequence:

2. C2 (C1 holds in the next state):

   - At S1 onward: event2 false ⇒ implication true
   - So C3 holds at every state.

   - S1 onward: true (event1 true and C3 true)

5. C5 (C4 holds in the next state):

   - At S1: C4 at S2 = true

Context summary:
- Initially event2 is true.
- After event2, no other events can happen → the system stays at event2 forever.
- After event1, no other events can happen (irrelevant because event1 never occurs here).

Evaluate the conditions:
1. C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" ≡ event2. So C1 is true in every state (since the system stays at event2).
2. C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds"" ≡ (event1 → event2). Because event1 never occurs in any state (we always have event2), the implication is true in every state (vacuously true whenever event1 is false).
3. C3: ""C2 always holds"" — since C2 is true in every state, C3 is true (C2 holds globally).

Context timeline:
- state0 (initial): event2 true, event1 false.
- After event2, event1 must happen, so state1: event1 true.
- After event1, no other events can happen, so all future states are event1.

Evaluate the formulas (state formula values shown per state when useful):

1. C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""
   - state0: true (event1 is false).
   - state1 and thereafter: false (event1 is true).

2. C2: ""C1 does not hold"" = not C1.
   - state0: false.
   - state1+: true.

3. C3: ""C2 does not hold"" = not C2 = C1.
   - state0: true.
   - state1+: false.

4. C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" = F C3.
   - At state0: C3 already true, so C4 is true.
   - At state1: C3 is false in all future states (stays false), so C4 is false there.

5. C5: ""Event1 does not happen"" = same as C1.
   - state0: true.
   - state1+: false.

6. C6: ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds"" = (C4 -> C5).
   - state0: C4 true and C5 true, so implication true.
   - state1+: C4 false, so implication true (false -> anything).

Thus C6 is true at state0 and at all future states. 

7. C7: ""C6 eventually holds"" = F C6.

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

1. Context gives: initially event2 is true. After event2, no other events can happen — so from the initial state the system stays at event2 in every future state. (Also ""after event1 no other events can happen"" is irrelevant because event1 never occurs.)

2. C1 = ""event2 does not happen"" is false in the initial state (event2 is true), and false in every state (since event2 holds always).

3. C2 = ""if event1 happens then C1 holds"" (event1 -> ¬event2). In any state where event1 is false, the implication is vacuously true. Since event1 never occurs here, C2 is true in every state (including the initial state).

4. C3 = ""C2 eventually holds"". Because C2 holds already at the initial state, C3 is true (it holds immediately, hence eventually).

5. C4 = ""C3 holds in the next state"". Since all states are identical (event2 forever) and C3 holds now, C3 also holds in the next state. So C4 is true in the initial state.

6. C5 = ""C4 always holds"" and C6 = ""C5 always holds"". Given the system stays at event2 and the above truths repeat at every state, both C5 and C6 are true.

7. C7 = ""event2 happens and C6 holds"". Event2 is true and C6 is true, so C7 is true.

3. C2: same as C1, so C2 is also false.

5. C4: identical to C3, so C4 is also false.

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context the only possible execution is: initial state s0 = event2, then s1 = event1, and thereafter s2,s3,... = event1 (after event1 no other events can happen, so it stays at event1).
2. C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Along the execution, event1 occurs at s1, so C1 is true at s0 (and at all later states).
3. C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (F C1). Since C1 already holds at s0, C2 is true at s0 (and at all states).
4. C3 is the same as C1, so true.
5. C4: ""If C2 holds then C3 holds"" (C2 -> C3). Because both C2 and C3 are true in every state, C4 holds in every state.
6. C5: ""C4 always holds."" That is true (C4 holds at every state).
7. C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" Since C5 holds now (indeed always), C6 is true at every state.
8. C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" The next state after the initial (s1) has C6 true, so C7 is true at the initial state.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- System timeline given the context: initial state = event2; from event2 the next state must be event1; from event1 no other events can happen, so the system stays at event1 forever. Sequence: event2, then event1 forever.

- Evaluate the claims:
  C1: ""Event2 always happens"" — false (true only at the initial state, false thereafter).
  C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — false (in the next state we have event1, so C1 is false there).
  C3: ""C2 always holds"" — false (C2 is false in every state).
  C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — false.
  C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" — false (C4 never holds).
  C6: ""C5 does not hold"" — true (since C5 is false, its negation is true; C6 holds now and thereafter).

Reasoning (step-by-step):

2. C1 = (event2 AND event2) simplifies to event2. So C1 is true exactly in states with event2 (s0, s2, ...).
3. C2 = not C1 = not event2, true exactly in states with event1 (s1, s3, ...).
4. C3 = C2 holds in the next state. At s0, next state s1 has C2 true (s1 is event1), so C3 is true at s0. In general C3 holds exactly in states whose next state is event1 (i.e., states that are event2).
5. C4 = event1 AND C3. This requires current state to be event1 and the next state to be event1. But from event1 the next state is event2, so C4 is false in every state.
6. C5 = C4 holds in the next state. Since C4 is always false, C5 is false in every state.
7. C6 = not C5, therefore C6 is true in every state.

2. Evaluate C1: ""Event2 eventually happens.""
   - Since we start at event1 and from event1 no transition to event2 is possible, event2 never happens.
   - Therefore C1 is false.

3. Evaluate C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (i.e., eventually C1 becomes true)
   - C1 is false at the initial state and at every reachable state (only event1 states are reachable), so C1 never becomes true.
   - Therefore C2 is false.

2. Therefore event2 never happens in any future state. So C1 (event2 eventually happens) is false.
3. C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" — since C1 is false, C2 is true (and remains true in all states).
4. C3 is ""C2 always holds"" — true because C2 is true now and in every future state.
5. C4 is the same as C2 (""C1 does not hold"") — true.
6. C5 is ""C3 or C4"" — true.
7. The next state (after one step) is still event1, so C5 still holds there. Thus C6 (""C5 holds in the next state"") is true."

- s0 (initial): event2.
- Rules force alternation: after event2 → event1 next; after event1 → event2 next.
- So the infinite trace is s0: event2, s1: event1, s2: event2, s3: event1, ...

Step 2 — evaluate C1 at a generic state s:
- C1 = ""event2 happens in the next state"" (i.e., s_{k+1} has event2).
- C1 is true exactly at states where the next state is event2, i.e. at s1, s3, s5, ... (the states that currently have event1). C1 is false at s0, s2, s4, ...

Step 3 — evaluate C2 (""If C1 holds, then event1 happens""):
- Interpreted pointwise: at a state s_k, C2 is (C1 at s_k) → (event1 at s_k).
- At any state where C1 is true (s1, s3, ...), the current state is event1 by construction, so the implication's consequent is true, hence implication true.
- At any state where C1 is false (s0, s2, ...), the implication is vacuously true.
- Therefore C2 holds at every state (globally true).

Step 4 — C3 (""C2 holds in the next state""):
- Since C2 holds at every state, C2 certainly holds in the next state of any state. So C3 holds at every state.

Step 5 — C4 is the same as C2, so C4 also holds at every state.

Step 6 — C5 = C3 or C4:
- Since both C3 and C4 hold everywhere, C5 holds at every state.

Step 7 — C6 = ""C5 eventually holds"":
- C5 already holds at the initial state, so it certainly holds eventually.

Context summary:
- Initially event1 holds.
- After event1, no other events can happen => the system stays in event1 forever.
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant here because event2 never occurs).

Thus every state (initial and all future) has event1 true and event2 false.

Evaluate the claims:

1. C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" — True in every state because event1 is true.
2. C2: ""C1 always holds."" — True, since C1 holds in every state.
3. C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" — False, because although C2 holds, event2 never happens.
4. C4: ""C3 always holds."" — False, because C3 is false (so it does not hold in any state).
5. C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" — False, since C4 never holds.
6. C6: ""If C5 holds, then event2 happens."" — This implication has a false antecedent (C5 is false), so C6 is vacuously true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the context, initially event1 happened and ""after event1, no other events can happen"" means the system stays in an event1 state forever (self-loop). Event2 never occurs on any reachable state.
- C1 is ""if event1 happens then event2 happens"" — in any state where event1 is true and event2 is false this implication is false. In the reachable (event1) states event1 is true and event2 is false, so C1 is false in every reachable state.
- C2 is ""C1 holds in the next state."" The next state is also an event1 state, so C2 is false as well.
- C3 is the same as C1, so false.
- C4 = C2 AND C3 is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- System trace from the context: S0: event2 true. After event2, event1 must happen → S1: event1 true. After event1, no other events can happen → all subsequent states S1, S2, ... have event1 true.
- Evaluate the propositions at the initial state S0:
  1. C1 = ""event1 does not happen"" = ¬event1. At S0, event1 is false, so C1(S0) = True.
  2. C2 = ""C1 does not hold"" = ¬C1 = event1. At S0, event1 is false, so C2(S0) = False.
  3. C3 = ""C2 does not hold"" = ¬C2 = ¬event1. Thus C3(S0) = True (same as C1).
  4. C4 = ""C3 holds in the next state"" = X C3. C3 at S1 is ¬event1(S1). But event1 is true at S1, so C4(S0) = False.
  5. C5 = ""C4 always holds"" = G C4. Since C4(S0) is already False, C5(S0) = False.
  6. C6 = ""C5 does not hold"" = ¬C5. So C6(S0) = True.
  7. C7 = ""C6 eventually holds"" = F C6. C6 holds at S0, so C7(S0) = True.
- Therefore C7 is True."

1. Context: Initially event2. After event2, no other events can happen. After event1, event2 must happen. From these, starting in event2 the system stays in event2 forever; event1 never occurs.

2. C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens"" — interpreted as both holding in the same state. Since at any state only event2 holds (and event1 never occurs), C1 is false at all states.

3. C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — since C1 is always false, C2 is true (at the initial state and at every state).

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Trace the system from the initial state:
   - State0: event1 (initially).
   - After event1, event2 must happen → State1: event2.
   - After event2, no other events can happen → from State1 onward it stays at event2 forever (State1, State2, ... all event2).

2. Evaluate the formulas at the initial state following the trace:
   - C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" At State0 the next state is State1 where event2 holds, so C1 is False at State0.
   - C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is already False at State0, C2 is False at State0 (and it will be False at all states).
   - C3: ""C2 always holds."" Same reasoning: C2 is always False, so C3 is False at all times.
   - C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 is never true at any future state, so C4 is False.
   - C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" C4 is False everywhere, so C5 is False at State0.
   - C6: ""C5 does not hold."" Since C5 is False at State0, C6 is True at State0.
   - C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" Because C6 is already True at the initial state (and eventual includes the current state), C7 is True.

- C3 = (event2) OR C2. In the initial state event2 is false and C2 is false, so C3 is false.
- C4 = event1 AND C3. Although event1 is true initially, C3 is false, so C4 is false initially.
- C5 = always C4, so C5 is false (since C4 is already false initially).
- C6 = C5 in the next state, so C6 is false in the initial state.

Context timeline:
- S0 (initial): event1 holds.
- S1 (next): event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen, so it stays at event2 (S1 forever).
Also, as in the examples, only one event holds in any single state.

Evaluate the conditions:

1. C1 = (event1 AND event2). Since no state has both events true simultaneously, C1 is false in every state.

2. C2 = (if event1 then C1) i.e. event1 -> C1.
   - In S0: event1 is true but C1 is false, so C2 is false in S0.
   - In S1 (and thereafter): event1 is false, so C2 is vacuously true in those states.
   So C2 is false in S0 and true in S1+.

3. C3 = (event1 AND C2).
   - In S0: event1 is true but C2 is false, so C3 is false.
   - In S1: event1 is false, so C3 is false.
   Thus C3 is false in every state.

4. C4 = (C3 holds in the next state). Since C3 is false in every state, C4 is false in every state.

5. C5 = (C4 does not hold) = not C4. Since C4 is always false, C5 is always true.

   - C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" ≡ Event1.
   - C2: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" ≡ Event1.
   - C3: C2 does not hold ≡ not(Event1).
   - C4: C3 does not hold ≡ not(not(Event1)) ≡ Event1.
   - C5: If C1 holds, then C4 holds ≡ (Event1 → Event1), which is a tautology (true in every state).

3. C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" Since C5 is true in every state, C6 is true in every state (including the initial state).

4. C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" Because C6 is true in every state, C7 is true at the initial state.

Context summary
- Initial state: event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen → from any state with event1, the next state (and hence all future states) remain event1.
- After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant here because event2 never occurs given the previous rule).

1. System behavior: the only possible trace is event1 (initial) -> event2 -> event2 -> ... (event2 persists).
2. C1: ""event1 and event1"" is just event1. So C1 is true in the initial state (where event1 holds) and false in all event2 states.
3. C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — this requires event1 to hold in the successor state. But the successor of the event1 state is event2 (and thereafter stays event2), so the next state never has event1. Therefore C2 is false in every state.
4. C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens"" is an implication C2 → event2. Since C2 is always false, the implication is vacuously true in every state; thus C3 holds everywhere.
5. C4: ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds"" (event2 → C3). Event2 states do satisfy C3, so C4 is true in every state.
6. C5: ""C4 holds and event1 happens"" — this is true exactly in the initial state (C4 true everywhere, event1 true only initially), so C5 holds in the initial state.
7. C6: ""event1 and event1"" is event1, so C6 holds in the initial state.

Context summary:
- Initially event1 holds.
- After event1, no other events can happen → from any state with event1 the next state must also be event1 (system stays at event1).
- After event2, event1 must happen → if a state with event2 occurred, its next state would be event1.

Evaluate the components:
1. C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" From the initial state (event1) the next state is event1 (by the ""after event1, no other events"" rule), so C1 is true at the initial state.
2. C2 (and C3): ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" For C2 to hold in some state, that state must have event2. But event2 can never occur starting from the initial event1, because from event1 no transition to event2 is allowed. So C2 is never true on any reachable state.
3. C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Since C3 (same as C2) never holds, C4 is false.
4. C5: ""If C2 holds, then C4 holds."" This implication is vacuously true in all reachable states (C2 never holds, so the implication is true).
5. C6: ""Event1 happens or C5 holds."" At the initial state event1 holds, so the disjunction is true (even independent of C5).

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context: initially event1 happens, and after event1 no other events can happen. So the system stays in event1 forever; event2 never occurs at any state.

2. C1: ""Event2 always happens."" This is false (event2 never happens).

3. C2: same as C1, so false.

4. C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false, C3 is true (and it already holds in the initial state).

5. C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" True, because C3 holds now (eventually includes the current state).

6. C5: ""If C1 holds, then C4 holds."" This implication is vacuously true because C1 is false (an implication with false antecedent holds).

7. C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" The next state is also event1 and the same reasoning applies, so C5 holds in the next state; thus C6 is true.

8. C7: ""C6 always holds."" Since C6 is true now and will remain true in all future states (system stays in event1), C7 is true.

1. From the context: the system starts with event1, and then alternates: after event1 → event2, after event2 → event1. So the state sequence is event1, event2, event1, event2, ... . Also, as in the examples, events do not occur simultaneously in one state.

2. C1 = (event1 AND event2). Since events are mutually exclusive in a state and the system alternates, no single state has both event1 and event2 true. Therefore C1 is always false.

3. C2 = (C1) OR (event2). Because C1 is always false, C2 is equivalent to ""event2"". So C2 holds exactly in the states where event2 occurs (every other state).

4. C3 is the same as C2 (C1 OR event2), so C3 ≡ event2 as well.

5. C4 = (if C2 then C3). Since C2 and C3 are logically identical, the implication C2 → C3 is true in every state (whenever C2 holds, C3 holds).

6. C5 = ""C4 always holds"". Because C4 is true in every state, C5 is true (C4 does indeed hold at all times).

7. C6 = ""C5 eventually holds"". If C5 holds in every state (including the initial state), then it certainly holds at some time — so C6 is true.

Reasoning (concise):
- The only possible trace is: state0 = event1, state1 = event2, state2 = event2, ... (after event1 must come event2; after event2 nothing else can happen).
- C1 is (event1 → event1), a tautology, so C1 holds in every state.
- C2 and C3 are both (C1 → event2). Since C1 is always true, each is equivalent to event2 (holds exactly in states where event2 holds).
- C4 = C2 ∨ C3 is therefore equivalent to event2.
- C5 = ""eventually C4"" = F(event2). In the trace, event2 occurs at state1 (and thereafter), so F(event2) is true at every state.
- C6 = ""always C5"" is true because C5 holds in every state.

- Therefore the system starts in event2 and remains in event2 at all times; event1 never occurs in any state.

Step 2 — evaluate the subformulas
- C1 = (event2 AND event1). Since at any state only one event can hold and we never have both, C1 is false in every state.
- C2 = (event1 AND C1). Because C1 is always false, C2 is false in every state.

Context summary:
- Initial state: event2 holds.
- After event2, no other events can happen — so once in event2 the system stays in event2 forever.
- (Also: after event1, event2 must happen — but that is irrelevant here because event1 will never occur given the other rule.)

Evaluate the conditions:

1. C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Given the system starts in event2 and no other events can happen after event2, event1 never occurs at any time. So C1 is True.

2. C2: same as C1, so True.

3. C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Since C2 is true in every state (event1 never happens), C3 is True.

4. C4: ""Event2 happens or C3 holds."" Event2 holds in the initial state (and in every state), so C4 is True (in fact true in all states).

5. C5: ""C4 always holds."" Because event2 holds in every state, C4 holds in every state, so C5 is True.

6. C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" True.

7. C7: ""C1 holds or C6 holds."" C1 is already True, so C7 is True.

Context (timeline):
- State 0 (initial): event2 holds.
- After event2, event1 must happen → State 1: event1 holds.
- After event1, no other events can happen → State 2,3,...: event1 holds forever.

Now evaluate the claims at the initial state:

2. C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e. at every state, eventually event2 happens). This is false because at state 1 (and all later states) event1 holds forever and event2 will never occur again, so C1 is false there. Therefore C2 is false.

6. C5: ""C4 always holds"" — false (C4 is false in the initial state).

7. C6: ""If C5 holds, then event2 happens"" — the antecedent C5 is false, so the implication is vacuously true; C6 holds.

Context: Initially event2. After event2 → event1. After event1 → event2. So the system alternates forever: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...

Evaluate the chain:

1. C1 = ""Event2 always happens"" (G event2). This is false because event1 holds on every other state.
2. C2 = ""C1 always holds"" = G(C1). Since C1 is false (it fails at states where event1 occurs), C2 is false.
3. C3 = ""C2 always holds"" = G(C2). Same reasoning ⇒ C3 is false.
4. C4 = ""Event2 happens or C3 holds"" = event2 OR false = event2. So C4 holds exactly at the event2 states (every other state).

6. C6 = ""C5 always holds"" = G(C5). Since C5 is true at every state, C6 is true.

1. From the context: initial state = event2. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, no other events can happen (so it stays event1 forever). Thus the timeline is: time0 = event2, time1 = event1, time2 = event1, ... (event1 forever after time1).

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context the system alternates: initial state = event2, next = event1, then event2, then event1, ... forever.

2. C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" This is true in states where the next state is event2 (i.e., in the event1 states), and false in states where the next state is event1 (i.e., in the event2 states). So C1 is true on every other state, not always.

3. C2: ""C1 always holds"" (G C1). Because C1 is false in some states (e.g., the initial event2 state), C2 is false — in fact C2 is false at every state (there are always future states where C1 is false).

4. C3: ""C2 does not hold"" = ¬C2. Since C2 is false everywhere, C3 is true in every state.

5. C4 = C1 (same as ""Event2 in the next state""). Irrelevant now because C3 already true.

6. C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" Since C3 is true in every state, C5 is true in every state.

7. C6: ""C5 eventually holds"" (F C5). Because C5 already holds now (indeed always), F C5 is true at every state.

8. C7: ""C6 always holds"" (G F C5). Since C6 is true at every state, C7 is true.

1. The system starts with event2 true (initially event2 happened).
2. Transition rules force alternation: after event2 → event1, after event1 → event2. So the state sequence is event2, event1, event2, event1, ...
3. C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" — that is false in states where event2 holds and true in states where event1 holds.

2. From any state (whether it's an event1 state or an event2 state) event1 will occur within at most one step. So ""event1 eventually happens"" (C1 and C3) is true at every state.
3. C2 is ""C1 always holds"" — i.e., from the current state, at every future state C1 holds. Because C1 holds at every state as noted, C2 is true at every state.
4. C4 = C2 and C3 is therefore true at every state.

- Initially event1 holds. After event1 must come event2, and after event2 must come event1. So the states alternate: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

Step 2 — simplify C1, C2
- C1: ""Event1 or event1"" simplifies to Event1.
- C2: ""Event1 or event1"" also simplifies to Event1.

Step 3 — C3
- C3 is ""C2 eventually holds"" i.e. ""eventually Event1"".
- Event1 holds in the initial state (and recurs), so C3 is true.

Step 4 — C4
- C4: ""If C1 holds then C3 holds"" is ""if Event1 now then eventually Event1"".
- At any state where Event1 holds, ""eventually Event1"" is true (current state already satisfies it); where Event1 does not hold the implication is vacuously true. So C4 holds in every state.

2. C2: same as C1, so True.
3. C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" C2 holds, so C3 is True.
4. C4: ""C1 and C3."" Both are True, so C4 is True.
5. C5: ""C4 always holds."" Since event2 holds in every state from the start, C1 and C2 hold in every state, so C3 and hence C4 hold in every state. Thus C5 is True.
6. C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" Because C5 holds in every state, it holds in the next state as well — C6 is True.

- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p), so C1 is true in every state.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" Since C1 is always true, C2 is true in every state (the disjunction with a true disjunct is true).
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" Because C2 is always true, the implication is always true, so C3 holds in every state.
- C4: ""Event2 happens or C3 holds."" With C3 true everywhere, C4 is true in every state.

Context timeline:
- Initially event1 is true.
- After event1, event2 must occur next.
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is absorbing).
So the sequence of states is: state0 = event1, state1 = event2, state2 = event2, ... (event2 forever after state1).

Evaluate the conditions:

1. C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" (¬event2).
   - False: event2 happens from state1 onward (and thus does happen).

2. C2: ""C1 always holds"" (always ¬event2).
   - False: since event2 occurs at state1, ¬event2 is not true in all states.

3. C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens"" (C2 ∨ event1).
   - At state0: event1 is true, so C3 is true at state0.
   - At state1 and later: event1 is false and C2 is false, so C3 is false there.
   - Therefore C3 does not hold in all states.

4. C4: ""C3 always holds"" (always C3).
   - False, because C3 is false at state1.

5. C5: ""C4 always holds""
   - False (C4 is already false).

6. C6: ""C5 always holds""
   - False.

7. C7: ""C6 eventually holds"" (eventually C6).

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. From the context: initially event1, and after event1 no other events can happen. So the system stays in event1 forever (event1 holds at every state). After event2 → event1 is irrelevant because event2 never occurs.
2. C1 = (event1 AND event2). Since only one event can hold in a state and the system is always in event1, C1 is false in every state.
3. C2 = (C1 OR event1). Because event1 holds always, C2 holds in every state.
4. C3 = “C2 eventually holds.” Since C2 already holds now (and always), C3 is true.
5. C4 = “If C3 holds, then event1 happens.” C3 is true and event1 holds, so C4 is true in every state.
6. C5 = “C4 holds in the next state.” Because C4 holds in every state, C5 is true.
7. C6 = “C5 holds in the next state.” Same reasoning, C6 is true.

3. C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" ≡ ""event1 eventually happens"". Given the alternating behavior, event1 occurs infinitely often (in particular at the next state from the initial event2). So C2 is true in every state (including the initial state).

Model: initial state s0: event1. After event1 must come event2, and after event2 must come event1. So the trace alternates: s0:event1, s1:event2, s2:event1, s3:event2, ...

Simplify the conditions:
- C1 = (event1 and event1) ≡ event1.
- C2 = always C1 ≡ always event1 (true iff event1 holds in every state). In this alternating trace, C2 is false (there are states with event2).
- C3 = next C2: false everywhere, since C2 is false in every state.
- C4 = (event2 → C3). Because C3 is false everywhere, C4 is true in states where event2 is false (i.e., event1 states) and false in event2 states.
- C5 = next C4: so C5 is true exactly in states whose successor is an event1 state. That means C5 is true at event2 states and false at event1 states.
- C6 = C5 and event1. This cannot be true anywhere because C5 is true only at event2 states, and event1 is false at those states; at event1 states C5 is false. So C6 is false in every state.
- C7 = next C6. Since C6 is false everywhere, C7 is false everywhere (in particular at the initial state).

Therefore C7 is False."

Context (single-event-per-state, as in examples):
- Initial state: event2.
- After event2, event1 must happen → next state is event1.
- After event1, no other events can happen → once at event1 it stays event1 forever.

So the infinite trace is: state0: event2, state1: event1, state2: event1, ...

Now evaluate the Ci:

1. C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
   - At state0 the next state is state1 where event1 holds, so C1 is true at state0.
   - At any state where event1 holds, the next state also has event1, so C1 is true at all states ≥1. Thus C1 holds everywhere (including initial).

2. C2: ""C1 eventually holds.""
   - Since C1 already holds at the current state (as shown), C2 is true at every state.

3. C3: ""C2 holds in the next state.""
   - Because C2 holds at every state, C3 is true at every state (including initial).

4. C4: ""C3 always holds.""
   - C3 holds at every state, so C4 is true.

5. C5: ""C4 holds in the next state.""
   - C4 is true everywhere, so C5 is true.

6. C6: ""C5 does not hold.""
   - But C5 does hold, so C6 is false (everywhere).

7. C7: ""C6 always holds.""
   - Since C6 is false, C7 is false.

Context summary:
- S0 (initial): event1 is true.
- After event1, event2 must happen, so S1 is event2.
- After event2, no other events can happen, so S1 and all future states are event2.

Simplify the hypothesis:
1. C1 = Next(event1).
2. C2 = Next(event1) (same as C1).
3. C3 = C1 or C2 = Next(event1).
4. C4 = C3 or event1 = Next(event1) or event1.

7. C7 = ""always C6"" (C6 must hold in every state).

Evaluate C6 along the path:
- At S0: event1 is true, so C6 = true.
- At S1: event2 is true, and the next state is event2, so event1 is false and Next(event1) is false. Hence C6 is false at S1.

Since C6 does not hold in every state (it fails at S1), C7 (""C6 always holds"") is False.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. System behavior: initial state = event1 true. Next state must be event2. After that, it stays at event2 forever (event1 false thereafter).

2. Evaluate C1 (event2 -> event1) in each state:
   - Initial state: event2 is false, so C1 is true (implication with false antecedent).
   - All later states: event2 is true and event1 is false, so C1 is false in every state from the first event2 state onward.

3. C2 = ""C1 does not hold"" and C3 = same as C2. At the initial state C1 holds, so C2 and C3 are false at the initial state.

4. C4 = event1 AND C3. At the initial state event1 is true but C3 is false, so C4 is false at the initial state (and it is false in all later states too).

5. C5 = ""C4 always holds"" is therefore false (C4 is not true in all states).

6. C6 = C2 OR C5. Both disjuncts are false at the initial state, so C6 is false.

Thus C6 is False."

Context summary:
- Initially event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen → once in event1, the system stays at event1 forever.
- (After event2, event1 must happen is irrelevant because event2 never occurs.)

Evaluate the conditions:
1. C1 (Event1 eventually happens): True — event1 is true in the initial state (and forever).
2. C2 (C1 always holds): True — from every state (including the initial and all future states) event1 has already happened, so ""event1 eventually happens"" holds at every state.
3. C3 (C2 always holds): True — C2 is true at every state, so ""always C2"" is also true.
4. C4 (C3 holds in the next state): True — since C3 is true everywhere, it is true in the next state.
5. C5 (C4 does not hold): False — C4 actually holds, so its negation is false.
6. C6 (Event1 eventually happens): True — same as C1.
7. C7 (C5 holds and C6 holds): False — C5 is false while C6 is true, so the conjunction is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. System trace from context:
   - State0: event2 (initial).
   - From event2, event1 must happen next.
   - State1: event1.
   - From event1, no other events can happen ⇒ it stays at event1 forever (State1, State2, ... all have event1).

2. Evaluate C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens.""
   - Interpreted as a state formula event2 ⇒ event1.
   - At State0 event2 is true and event1 is false, so C1 is false at State0 (and thus not a global tautology).

3. C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds.""
   - At State0 event2 is true but C1 is false, so C2 is false at State0 (and everywhere).

4. C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens.""
   - Since C2 is false everywhere, C3 is false everywhere.

5. C4: ""Event2 happens or C3 holds.""
   - At State0 event2 is true, so C4 is true at State0.
   - At State1+ event2 is false and C3 is false, so C4 is false at State1 onward.

6. C5: ""C4 eventually holds.""
   - At State0, C4 already holds, so C5 is true at State0.
   - At State1 onward, no future state has event2 (and C3 never holds), so C4 never holds ⇒ C5 is false at State1 onward.

7. C6: ""C5 always holds.""
   - Requires C5 to be true at every state. C5 is false at State1 onward, so C6 is false everywhere.

8. C7: ""C6 eventually holds.""
   - Since C6 is never true at any state, C7 is false.

Context summary:
- Initially event2 is true.
- After event2, no other events can happen — so once in event2 the system stays in event2 forever (event1 is false whenever event2 is true).
- After event1, no other events can happen — similarly, if event1 ever held it would persist, but it does not in the given initial trace.

Evaluate the conditions:

1. C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — this simplifies to just event2. So C1 is true in the initial state (since event2 holds initially) and remains true thereafter.

2. C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"" — i.e. (event2 -> event1). In the initial state event2 is true and event1 is false (events are exclusive), so the implication is false. Thus C2 does not hold in the initial state.

3. C3: ""C2 always holds"" — since C2 is already false at the initial state, C3 is false.

4. C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens"" — an implication with a false antecedent (C3 is false), so C4 is true (vacuously).

5. C5: ""C4 does not hold"" — since C4 is true, C5 is false.

6. C6: ""C5 always holds"" — C5 is false, so C6 is false.

Context timeline:
- state0: event1 is true.
- state1: by ""After event1, event2 must happen"", event2 is true.
- state2 onward: ""After event2, no other events can happen"" implies event2 stays true forever.
So states: state0 = event1; state1, state2, ... = event2.

Now evaluate the Cs:

1. C1 = ""Event2 happens in the next state"" = X(event2).
   - At state0, X(event2) is true (state1 has event2). So C1 is true at state0.
2. C2 = ""Event2 happens and C1 holds"" = event2 ∧ C1.
   - At state0, event2 is false, so C2 is false at state0.
   - At state1 and all later states, event2 is true and X(event2) is true (next state also has event2), so C2 is true from state1 onward.
3. C3 = ""C2 eventually holds"" = F(C2).
   - From state0, C2 holds at state1, so C3 is true at state0 (and in fact true at every state).
4. C4 = ""C3 holds in the next state"" = X(C3).
   - Since C3 holds at every state, X(C3) is true at every state; C4 is true everywhere.
5. C5 = ""C4 eventually holds"" = F(C4).
   - C4 already holds everywhere, so C5 is true everywhere.
6. C6 = ""C5 does not hold"" = ¬C5.
   - Because C5 is true everywhere, C6 is false everywhere.

3. C2 is identical to C1, so C2 ≡ Event1.

4. C3: C1 or C2 ≡ Event1 ∨ Event1 ≡ Event1. Thus C3 holds in every state (since event1 holds always).

5. C4: “C3 eventually holds” is true at the initial state (indeed C3 already holds now), and in fact true in every state.

6. C5: “C4 does not hold” is therefore false (C4 does hold), and remains false in every state.

7. C6: “C5 eventually holds” is false, because C5 never holds on the trace.

8. C7: “C6 always holds” is false, since C6 is false (not holding now or ever).

Context (possible traces):
- Initially event2.
- From event2, event1 must happen next.
- From event1, no other events can happen (so once at event1 it stays event1 forever).

1. Context: initially event1 holds. ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means once event1 holds, the system stays in states where event1 holds (no transition to event2). Similarly, ""after event2, no other events can happen"" would make event2 persist if it were reached.

2. C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Interpreting this as a state implication (event1 → event2). At the initial state event1 is true while event2 is false, so C1 is false in the initial state.

3. C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is already false at the initial state and the system remains in states with event1 true and event2 false, C1 never becomes true; therefore C2 is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Initially event1 happened and after event1 no other events can happen. So the system stays forever in event1 — event2 never occurs.
2. C1, C2, C5: each asserts ""Event2 eventually happens."" Since event2 never occurs, these are all false.
3. C3 = C1 and C2 is false (both conjuncts false).
4. C4 = ""C3 holds in the next state."" The next state is still event1, so C3 is false there as well; hence C4 is false.
5. C6 = ""If event2 happens, then C5 holds."" Because event2 never happens in this system, the implication is vacuously true (and even if event2 did happen, C5 would then be true).
6. C7 = C4 and C6. With C4 false and C6 true, the conjunction is false.

1. System behavior from the context:
   - Initially event1.
   - After event1, event2 must happen.
   - After event2, event1 must happen.
   So the system alternates: event1, event2, event1, event2, ... forever.

2. Evaluate C1 and C2:
   - C1: event1 or event2. In every state exactly one of event1/event2 holds, so C1 is true in every state.
   - C2 is the same as C1, so C2 is also always true.

3. Evaluate C3 and C4:
   - C3: if event2 then C2. Since C2 is always true, C3 holds in every state.
   - C4: C3 always holds. Because C3 holds in every state, C4 is true.

4. Evaluate C5 and C6:
   - C5: C4 does not hold. But C4 is true, so C5 is false.
   - C6: C5 holds and event2 happens. Since C5 is false, C6 is false in every state.

5. Evaluate C7: ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds.""
   - At the initial state C1 holds (event1), but C6 does not hold. Thus the implication is false at the initial state (and in fact C1 is always true while C6 is always false).

Context summary:
- Initially event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so the system stays in event1 forever).
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant since event2 never occurs here).

1. C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""  
   Since we start at event1 and no other events can occur after event1, event2 never happens. So C1 is True.

2. C2: ""C1 holds in the next state.""  
   The next state (if any) remains event1, so event2 still does not happen. Thus C2 is True.

3. C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds.""  
   event1 does happen (initially) and C2 is True, so the implication C3 is True.

4. C4: ""C1 holds in the next state.""  
   This is the same as C2, so C4 is True.

5. C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds.""  
   C3 is True and C4 is True, so the implication C5 is True.

   - C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" ≡ in the state after the current one, not(always Event1).

3. Evaluate in the given model:
   - Event1 never occurs (system stays at event2), so C1 is false in every state.
   - Therefore C2 (and C5) are false.

1. Context gives the state sequence: initial state S0: event2. After event2, event1 must happen → S1: event1. After event1, no other events can happen → all future states remain event1 (S1, S2, ... all have event1).

2. C1 = ""Event2 or event2"" = Event2. So C1 holds in S0, and fails in S1 and later.

3. C2 = same as C1 = Event2.

4. C3 = ""C2 always holds"" means Event2 holds in every state. That is false because Event2 holds in S0 but not in S1 (S1 has event1). So C3 is false.

5. C4 = ""C3 always holds"" — since C3 is false at S0, C4 is false.

6. C5 = C1 and C4 — needs C4 true, so C5 is false.

7. C6 = ""C5 always holds"" — false (C5 is false already).

8. C7 = ""C6 eventually holds"" — false, because C6 is never true in any state.

Therefore C7 is False.

1. Context summary: Initially event1. After event1, the next state must be event2. After event2, no other events can happen (so the system stays at event2 forever). Thus the sequence of states is: initial = event1, then event2, then event2, ...

Model from the context:
- State 0 (initial): event1 true, event2 false.
- After event1, event2 must happen → State 1: event2 true, event1 false.
- After event2, no other events can happen → it stays in State 1 forever.

Now evaluate the conditions:

1. C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens"" — as a state formula: event2 → event1 (equivalently ¬event2 ∨ event1).
   - In State 0: event2 is false, so C1 is true there (antecedent false).
   - In State 1: event2 is true but event1 is false, so C1 is false in State 1.

2. C2: ""C1 holds in the next state.""
   - From State 0 the next state is State 1, where C1 is false, so C2 is false in State 0.
   - From State 1 the next state is State 1 (itself), and C1 is false there, so C2 is false in State 1 as well.
   => C2 is false in every state.

3. C3: ""C2 always holds"" (globally C2).
   - Since C2 is false in every state, C3 is false.

4. C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" (F C3).
   - C3 never holds, so C4 is false.

5. C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" (F C4).
   - C4 never holds, so C5 is false.

6. C6: ""C5 does not hold"" (¬C5).
   - C5 is false, so ¬C5 is true. Hence C6 is true (in every state).

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Interpret conjunctions as state formulas (both events true in the same state), consistent with the examples.
2. Context: initial state has event2 true and event1 false. The next state must be event1 (and then system stays at event1).
3. C1 and C6 are the same: ""event2 and event1"" — this requires both events true in the same state. That never holds in any state (states have either event2 or event1, not both).
4. Therefore C1 (and C6) is false in every state.
5. C2 = ""C1 always holds"" is false (since C1 is never true).
6. C3 = ¬C2 is true, so C4 = ¬C3 = C2 is false.
7. C5 = ""C4 holds in the next state"" is false (C4 is false everywhere).
8. C7 = C5 and C6; both conjuncts are false, so C7 is false.

Thus C7 is False."

- After event2, event1 must happen; after event1, event2 must happen.
- So the execution alternates: event2 (initial) → event1 → event2 → event1 → ... Thus event1 holds in every other state (it does occur).

Step 2 — simplify the conditions
- C1: (event1 AND event1) ≡ event1.
- C2: (C1 AND event1) ≡ (event1 AND event1) ≡ event1.
- C3: same as C2 ≡ event1.
- C4: C3 does not hold ≡ NOT event1.

- C6: C5 always holds ≡ always (NOT event1) — i.e., event1 never occurs.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context the system alternates forever: initial state s0 has event1, then s1 event2, s2 event1, s3 event2, … (event1 and event2 must alternate).

2. C1: ""Event1 always happens"" (globally) is false because s1, s3, ... have event2, not event1.

3. C2: ""C1 always holds"" (i.e. globally C1) is also false (equivalent to C1, which is false).

4. C3: ""C2 does not hold"" = ¬C2, so C3 is true (since C2 is false).

5. C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" = X C3. C3 is true at s1 (C2 is false there), so C4 is true at s0.

6. C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" = X C4. C4 is true at s1 (because C3 is true at s2), so C5 is true at s0.

7. C6: ""C5 eventually holds"" = F C5. C5 already holds at the initial state, so C6 is true.

8. C7: ""C6 does not hold"" = ¬C6. Since C6 is true, C7 is false.

Therefore C7 is False."

Context summary:
- s0 (initial): event1 is true.

- After event2, no other events can happen, so event2 holds in s1 and all subsequent states.

Evaluate the conditions at the initial state s0:

1. C1 = ""event2 in the next state"" (X event2). True at s0 because s1 has event2.
2. C2 = C1 OR event2. At s0, C1 is true, so C2 is true.
3. C3 = NOT C2. Since C2 is true at s0, C3 is false.
4. C4 = X C3 (C3 holds in the next state). At s1, C2 is true (event2 holds), so C3 is false at s1; thus C4 is false at s0.
5. C5 = X event2, same as C1, so C5 is true at s0.
6. C6 = (C4 -> C5). Because C4 is false at s0, the implication is true at s0 (false implies anything).

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context: initially event2; after event2 → event1; after event1 → event2. So the trace alternates forever: state0 event2, state1 event1, state2 event2, state3 event1, ...

2. Evaluate C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" = ¬event2. This is true in odd states (where event1 holds) and false in even states (where event2 holds).

3. C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" (F C1). From any state there is a future state with event1 (the next state if currently event2, or the current state if already event1). So C2 is true at every state.

4. C3 = ""C2 always holds"" (G C2). Since C2 is true at every state, C3 is true at every state.

5. C4 = ""C3 holds in the next state"" (X C3). Because C3 is true everywhere, C4 is true at every state.

6. C5 = ""C4 does not hold"" = ¬(X C3). Since C4 is true everywhere, C5 is false at every state.

7. C6 = ""C5 always holds"" (G C5). Because C5 is false everywhere, C6 is false at every state.

8. C7 = ""C6 eventually holds"" (F C6). Since C6 never holds at any state, C7 is false.

Context summary:
- Initially event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen → once in an event1 state, all future states remain event1.
- Therefore the system stays in event1 forever; event2 never occurs.

Simplify the claims:
- C1: ""Event2 or event2"" ≡ Event2.
- C2: same ≡ Event2.
- C3: Event2 and C2 ≡ Event2 and Event2 ≡ Event2.
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" ≡ always(Event2).

- C6: ""C5 eventually holds"" ≡ eventually(always(Event2)).
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds"" ≡ eventually(eventually(always(Event2))) ≡ eventually(always(Event2)).

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Context implies: initially event1 is true. ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means any successor of an event1 state is also event1 (so event1 holds in every future state). Thus event1 holds in all states (now and forever).

2. C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" is equivalent to event1, so C1 holds in all states.

3. C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Since C1 (event1) holds in every state, it holds in the next state as well, so C2 holds in every state.

4. C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Same reasoning: C2 holds everywhere, so C3 holds everywhere.

5. C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Because C3 already holds now, C4 is true.

6. C5: ""C4 does not hold."" But C4 does hold, so C5 is false (in every state).

7. C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" Since C5 is always false, C6 is false in every state.

Context summary: starting state = event2. After event2 → event1. After event1 → event2. So states alternate: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...

Evaluate the Cs:

1. C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" — i.e., ¬event1 in the current state.
2. C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"" — this is (¬event1 → event2), logically equivalent to (event1 ∨ event2). Given the system's states are always either event1 or event2, C2 is true in every state.
3. C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens"" — since C2 is always true, C3 is true exactly in those states where event2 holds. So C3 ≡ event2.
4. C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — that means ""next state has event2"". Because states alternate, next state has event2 exactly when the current state is event1. So C4 is true in event1 states and false in event2 states.
5. C5: ""C4 always holds"" — this would require C4 true in every state. But C4 is false in event2 states, so C5 is false.
6. C6: ""C5 does not hold"" — since C5 is false, C6 is true (C6 ≡ ¬C5).
7. C7: ""C6 does not hold"" — this is ¬C6. Because C6 is true, C7 is false.

3. C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" = C1(next). Thus C2 is true exactly in states where the current state is event1 (because then the next state is event2, and C1 is true at event2 states). So C2 holds in event1 states and fails in event2 states.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context the system alternates: initial state = event2, then event1, then event2, then event1, ... forever. So event1 and event2 both occur infinitely often, but never in the same state.

2. C1 is ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens"" (i.e. state formula event1 -> event2). C2 is identical to C1. They may be true or false in particular states, but they are syntactically the same formula.

3. C3 is ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Since C1 and C2 are identical, C3 is true in every state (whenever C1 holds, C2 holds as well).

4. C4 is ""C3 always holds."" Because C3 holds in every state, C4 is true.

5. C5 is ""C4 does not hold."" This contradicts step 4, so C5 is false in every state.

6. C6 is ""C5 eventually holds."" Since C5 never holds, C6 is false.

7. C7 is ""Event2 happens and C6 holds."" Although event2 does happen in many states, C6 is false, so the conjunction is false.

Therefore C7 is False."

1. Context summary:

   - After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 occurs, all future states remain event2).

2. Evaluate C1 and C2:

   - C2 is identical to C1, so C2 also holds in every state.

3. C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds"".
   - Since C2 holds everywhere, C3 is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"".

   - Therefore C3 is false in all reachable states.

1. The initial state S0 has event1 true. ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means the system stays in states where event1 holds (as in the examples), so every state S0, S1, S2, ... has event1 true and event2 never occurs.

2. C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens"" is false in S0 (event1 true, event2 false). So C1 is false (indeed false in every state).

3. C2: ""C1 does not hold"" is true (since C1 is false).

4. C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" is true in S0 because C2 is true in the next state (and in all states).

5. C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" is true (it already holds now).

6. C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" is true.

7. C6: ""C5 always holds"" is true because C5 holds in every state.

2. C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" — false (event1 occurs at state1, state3, ...).

6. C5 = ¬C4 — true exactly at event2 states, false at event1 states.
7. C6 = ""C5 always holds"" — false (C5 alternates, so it is not true at all future states).
8. C7 = C6 ∨ event1 — since C6 is false, C7 is equivalent to event1, so C7 holds exactly at event1 states and not at event2 states.

1. From the context: initial state has event2. After event2 must come event1, and after event1 must come event2. So the system alternates: event2, event1, event2, event1, ... forever (only one event true per state).

2. Simplify the conditions:
- C1: event2 and event2 ≡ event2.
- C2: not C1 ≡ not event2.
- C3: not C2 ≡ not(not event2) ≡ event2.
- C4: event2 and C3 ≡ event2 and event2 ≡ event2.
- C5: C4 always holds ≡ always(event2) — requires event2 true in every state.
  
3. Check C5: in the actual trace event2 is false in the states where event1 occurs (odd steps), so always(event2) is false (it does not hold at all states).

4. C6: ""eventually C5"" — is there any future state from which always(event2) holds? No. The alternation continues forever, so no suffix has event2 true at every state. Thus C6 is false.

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Timeline from context:
   - s0 (initial): event2 = true, event1 = false.
   - s1 (next): event1 = true, event2 = false (after event2, event1 must happen).
   - s2 (and onward): event1 = true, event2 = false (after event1 no other events can happen, so it stays at event1).

2. Evaluate C1: ""event2 and event1"" — requires both true in the same state. This is false at s0, s1, s2. So C1 is always false.

3. C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" This is the implication event1 -> C1. Since C1 contains event1 itself, this is equivalent to event1 -> event2. Evaluate:
   - s0: event1 false → C2 true.
   - s1: event1 true but event2 false → C2 false.
   - s2: same as s1 → C2 false.

4. C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" i.e. C2(s_next).
   - C2(s1) = false, so C3 at s0 is false.
   - C2(s2) = false, so C3 false at s1 and s2 as well.
   So C3 is false everywhere.

5. C4: ""C3 does not hold"" = not C3. Since C3 is false, C4 is true at all states.

6. C5: same as C1 (event2 and event1) — always false.

7. C6: ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds"" = C4 -> C5.
   - C4 is true and C5 false at every state, so C6 is false at every state.

8. C7: ""C6 holds in the next state"" = C6(s_next). At the initial state s0, C7 = C6(s1) = false.

Therefore C7 is False."

3. C7 is: ""C6 holds in the next state"" — i.e., is C6 true at State1?
   - At State1 and thereafter, event2 never occurs.
   - From State1, ""Event2 eventually happens"" is false, so C1, C2, C3 are false at State1.

3. C2 = not C1. Since C1 is always false, C2 is true (holds now and always).
4. C3 = ""C2 eventually holds"". Because C2 already holds at the initial state, C3 is true.
5. C4 = ""C3 always holds"". From every state (only event1 states) C2 holds, so C3 holds at every state; therefore C4 is true.
6. C5 = ""C4 eventually holds"". C4 already holds, so C5 is true.

- C1 = (event1 ∧ event2). Since exactly one event holds in each state, C1 is false in every state.
- C2 = (event2 → C1). At a state where event2 holds, C1 is false, so C2 is false there. At a state where event1 holds, event2 is false so the implication is vacuously true. Thus C2 is true exactly at the event1 states (odd t) and false at the event2 states (even t).
- C3 = “C2 holds in the next state” = C2(next). Therefore C3 is true exactly at the event2 states (because their next states are event1 states where C2 is true) and false at event1 states.
- C4 is the same as C2, so it has the same truth pattern (true at event1 states, false at event2 states).
- C5 = C3 ∧ C4. For any state s this requires C2(s+1) ∧ C2(s). But C2 alternates (true on odd, false on even), so there is no state where both C2(s) and C2(s+1) are true. Hence C5 is false in every state.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context: initial state = event2. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, no other events can happen. So the actual trace is: initial state event2, next state event1, and thereafter event1 (or terminal event1).

2. C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True (it happens in the next state).

3. C2: same as C1, True.

4. C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" Evaluate at the initial state: C2 does hold (event1 will eventually happen), but event1 does not hold at the initial state (initially event2). Therefore C3 is False at the initial state.

5. C4: ""C3 always holds."" Since C3 is already false at the initial state, C4 is False.

6. C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Negation of C4, so C5 is True.

7. C6: ""C5 does not hold."" Negation of C5, so C6 is False.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Context gives deterministic alternation: initial state (time 0) has event2. After event2, event1 must happen; after event1, event2 must happen. So the timeline is: time0 = event2, time1 = event1, time2 = event2, time3 = event1, … (infinite alternation).

2. C1, C2, C4 are the same formula: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" (i.e., at time t they assert event1 at t+1). C3 is ""C2 always holds"" i.e. for all times t, event1 holds at t+1 — this would require every future state to be event1.

3. In the actual timeline, event1 holds at time1 (so C1 true at time0), but event1 does not hold at time2 (time2 is event2). Therefore C2 is not true at all times, so C3 is false.

4. C5 = C3 or C4. Since C3 is false, C5 reduces to C4, which is just C1 at the current time.

5. C6 = C1 or C5, so with the simplifications C6 ≡ C1 (at each time).

6. C7 is ""C6 always holds"", i.e. for every time t, event1 holds at t+1. But at t=1 this requires event1 at time2, which is false (time2 = event2). Hence C7 is false.

Therefore C7: False."

Reasoning (step-by-step, concise):

- From the context the system alternates: initial state s0 has event2; then s1 event1; s2 event2; s3 event1; ... forever alternating.

- C1 = ""not event2"". So C1 holds exactly in the event1 states (s1, s3, ...), and is false in the event2 states (s0, s2, ...).

- C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"". So C2 is true at a state exactly when the next state is an event1 state. Given the alternation, C2 is true at event2 states (s0, s2, ...) and false at event1 states.

- C3 = ""C2 always holds"" (C2 true at every state). This is false because C2 is false at event1 states.

- Since C3 is false at every state, C4 (C3 in the next state), C5, and C6 (C5 always holds) are all false everywhere.

- Therefore C6 never holds, so C7 = ""C6 eventually holds"" is false.

Thus C7 is False."

4. C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — C2 is false in every state, so it never becomes true. Thus C3 is false.

5. C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" — same reasoning, C3 is always false, so C4 is false.

6. C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" — false for the same reason.

7. C6: ""C5 always holds"" — C5 is false, so C6 is false.

1. Describe the system behavior:
   - Initial state: event2 holds.
   - From event2, event1 must happen next.
   - From event1, no other events can happen (so the system stays at event1 forever).
   - Trace from the initial state: event2 → event1 → event1 → ...

2. Evaluate C1: ""Event1 eventually happens.""
   - True: event1 occurs at the next step.

3. Evaluate C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds.""
   - At an event1 state: event1 holds and C1 (event1 eventually happens) is true, so C2 is true there.
   - At the initial event2 state: event1 does not hold, so C2 is false at the initial state.

4. Evaluate C3: ""C2 always holds.""
   - C3 requires C2 to hold at every future state.
   - It is false at the initial state (C2 is false there), so C3 is false at the initial state (though it is true at event1 states).

5. Evaluate C4: ""Event1 eventually happens.""
   - Same as C1, so C4 is true.

6. Evaluate C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" (C3 -> C4)
   - At the initial state: C3 is false, so the implication is true.
   - At event1 states: C3 is true and C4 is true, so the implication is true.
   - Therefore C5 is true in all states.

7. Evaluate C6: ""If C5 holds, then event2 happens."" (C5 -> event2)
   - Since C5 is true in every state, C6 reduces to ""event2 holds"".
   - C6 is true at states where event2 holds (the initial state) and false at states where event1 holds (all subsequent states).

8. Evaluate C7: ""C6 always holds.""
   - C6 is not true at the event1 states, so it does not hold at all times.

Reasoning:
1. Context gives that initially event1 happened and after event1 no other events can happen. Hence the only possible future is event1 (event1 holds now and at all future states). Event2 never occurs.
2. C1 and C2 (""event1 eventually happens"") are true (event1 is already true and persists).
3. C3 is the implication: if C2 holds then event2 happens. Since C2 is true, C3 requires event2 to occur. But event2 never occurs under the context, so C3 is false.
4. C4 = C1 and C3 is false (because C3 is false).
5. C5 (C4 in the next state) is false; C6 (event2 or C5) is false.
6. Therefore C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is false.

Thus C7 is False."

Context summary:
- Initially event2 is true.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so any event1 state is followed by event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal; the system stays at event2).

Interpret the Cs:
1. C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — this is just event2. So C1 is true exactly in states where event2 holds (true in the initial state).
2. C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds"" — this requires event1 and event2 simultaneously in the same state. Given the model (one event per state), that is impossible; C2 is false in every state.
3. C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens"" — since C2 is always false, C3 is also always false.
4. C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" — because C3 never holds, this eventuality is false.
5. C5: ""C4 holds and event1 happens"" — C4 is false, so C5 is false in every state.
6. C6: ""C5 always holds"" — this requires C5 to be true in every state; but C5 is false (even in the initial state), so C6 is false.
7. C7: ""C6 eventually holds"" — since C6 is false in every state and the system remains stuck at event2 forever, C6 never becomes true, so C7 is false.

- C4: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True (same as C1).

4. C4 is ""if C1 then C3"". Since C1 is true, C4 is equivalent to C3, hence C4 is false in every state.

- After event1, no other events can happen → from any state with event1 the next state must also be event1.
- After event2, event1 must happen → if event2 ever occurs, the next state would be event1.

1. Context dynamics:

   - After event2, event1 must happen → any occurrence of event2 would be followed by event1, which then stays event1 forever.
   - Therefore, in every reachable state from the initial state, event1 holds and event2 never occurs.

2. Simplify the hypotheses:
   - C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" ≡ event2.
   - C2: C1 always holds ≡ always(event2). This is false (event2 never holds).
   - C3: event1 happens or C2 holds ≡ event1 OR always(event2). Since event1 holds now (and always), C3 is true.
   - C4: event2 happens or C3 holds ≡ event2 OR true ≡ true. So C4 holds now (and in all states).
   - C5: C4 eventually holds. Since C4 already holds, C5 is true.
   - C6: C5 does not hold. Since C5 is true, C6 is false.
   - C7: C6 holds in the next state. The next state is also event1, where C6 is false; hence C7 is false.

2. C1 and C2 (""Event1 always happens"") are false — there are states (the event2 states) where event1 does not happen.

3. C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false because C2 is already false.

4. C4 (""If event1 happens, then C3 holds"") is false in the initial state: event1 is true there but C3 is false, so the implication fails.

5. C5 (""If C1 holds, then C4 holds"") is true in every state because C1 is false (false implies anything).

6. C6 (""C5 does not hold"") is therefore false in every state (since C5 holds everywhere).

7. C7 (""C6 always holds"") requires C6 to be true in all states, but C6 is false everywhere, so C7 is false.

1. From the context: state0 = event2. After event2, event1 must happen, so state1 = event1. After event1, no other events can happen, so from state1 onward the system stays at event1 forever (state1, state2, ... all event1).

2. C1 = ""event2 happens in the next state."" Evaluate C1 at each state:
   - At state0, the next state is state1 which is event1, so C1 is false.
   - At any state ≥1, the next state is event1, so C1 is false.

3. C2 is ""C1 holds or event2 happens"". Since C1 is False, C2 reduces to ""event2 happens"" (i.e., true exactly in the states where event2 holds). So C2 is true in the event2 states and false in the event1 states.  
4. C4 is ""C2 or C3"". With C3 False, C4 ≡ C2.  
5. C5 is ""C4 does not hold"", so C5 ≡ not C2 — true exactly in the event1 states and false in the event2 states.

Reasoning (step-by-step summary):

- Let P = (event2 AND event1). This is impossible in any single state (events are mutually exclusive), so P is always false. Thus C1 and C3 (both equal to P) are false in every state.

- C2 is (event2 -> P). This is true in any state where event2 is false, and false in any state where event2 is true (because then P is false). In our system: initial state has event1 (so event2 is false) → C2 true at the initial state. At the event2 state, C2 is false.

- C4 = C2 OR C3. At the initial state this is true (C2 true). At the event2 state this is false (C2 false and C3 false).

- C5 = NOT C4. So C5 is false at the initial state and true at the event2 state.

- C6 is (event2 -> C5). Check both relevant states:
  - Initial state: event2 is false, so the implication holds (true).
  - Event2 state: event2 is true, and C5 is true there, so the implication holds (true).
  Thus C6 holds in all states.

- C7 = NOT C6, so because C6 holds, C7 is false.

Context behavior:
- Initially event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen → every future state remains event1.
- After event2, event1 must happen (not relevant since event2 never occurs here).

Evaluate the conditions in the initial state and successive states (which are all event1):

1. C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens"" ≡ (event1 → event2).
   - In the initial state event1 is true and event2 is false, so C1 is false.

2. C2: ""C1 holds in the next state.""
   - Next state is still event1; C1 is false there too. So C2 is false.

1. System timeline:
   - state0: initially event1 (so event2 is false).
   - After event1, event2 must happen, so state1: event2 (true).
   - After event2, no other events can happen, so from state1 onward event2 stays true forever.

2. Simplify the conditions:
   - C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" => C1 ≡ event2.
   - C2: C1 does not hold => C2 ≡ not event2.
   - C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds"" => event2 ⇒ (not event2) which simplifies to not event2 (equivalently C3 ≡ not event2).
   - C4: C3 holds in the next state => C4 ≡ next(not event2).
   - C5: C4 eventually holds => C5 ≡ eventually next(not event2).
     (So C5 is true iff there exists some state t whose next state has event2 = false.)
   - C6: Event2 happens or C5 holds => C6 ≡ event2 OR eventually next(not event2).
   - C7: C6 always holds => C7 ≡ always(event2 OR eventually next(not event2)).

3. Evaluate at state0 (initial):
   - event2 is false at state0.
   - Is there any future state whose next state has event2 = false? No: only state0 has event2 = false; from state1 onward event2 is true forever, so no future state's next state has event2 = false.
   - Therefore eventually next(not event2) is false at state0.
   - Thus C6 at state0 = event2 OR C5 = false OR false = false.

4. Since C6 is false at the initial state, it is not true at all states, so ""always C6"" (C7) is false.

Context summary:
- Initially event1 holds.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so the system stays at event1 forever).
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant since event2 never occurs here).

Evaluate the claims:

1. C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
   - From the context, after event1 no other events can happen, so the next state is event1, not event2. Therefore C1 is false.

2. C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens.""
   - C1 is false, so C2 is false (conjunction with false).

3. C3: same as C2, so also false.

4. C4: ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds.""
   - Since event2 never happens in any reachable state, the antecedent is always false; the implication is vacuously true. Thus C4 is true.

5. C5: ""C2 holds and C4 holds.""
   - C2 is false and C4 is true, so C5 is false.

6. C6: ""C5 always holds.""
   - C5 is already false in the initial state, so it does not always hold. Therefore C6 is false.

- After event2, no other events can happen → the system stays at event2 forever.
- After event1, no other events can happen → if ever at event1, it would stay at event1 forever.

So the run is: event2 at the initial state and at every future state (no transition to event1).

Step 2 — expand the formulas:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" (globally: event1 holds at every state).
- C2: C1 holds in the next state = X C1.
- C3: same as C2 = X C1.
- C4: C3 does not hold = not (X C1).
- C5: C2 and C4 = (X C1) and not (X C1).
- C6: C5 and event1 holds now.

Step 3 — evaluate on the actual run:
- Event1 is false at the initial state (initially event2), so C1 is false.
- Since the run stays at event2 forever, C1 is also false at the next state, so X C1 (C2 and C3) are false.
- C4 = not (X C1) is true.
- C5 = (X C1) and not (X C1) is false (a contradiction: false AND true = false).

Reasoning, step by step:

1. From the context: initially event1 holds. After event1, event2 must happen; after event2, event1 must happen. Thus the system alternates: state0 = event1, state1 = event2, state2 = event1, etc.

2. Simplify the hypothesis formulas:
   - C1 = event1 AND event1 = event1.
   - C2 = C1 AND event1 = event1 AND event1 = event1.
   - By the same folding, C3, C4, C5 all simplify to event1.
   - C6 = event1 OR C5 = event1 OR event1 = event1.
   - Therefore C6 is just ""event1 holds"".

Context summary:
- Initial state: event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so the system stays in states where event1 holds forever).
- After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant because event2 never occurs given the above).

1. C1 = ""Event2 eventually happens."" Since we start in event1 and no other events can occur afterward, event2 never happens. So C1 is false in the initial state and at every future state.

2. C2 = ""C1 eventually holds."" That requires some future state where C1 is true. But C1 is false at every state (never becomes true), so C2 is false.

3. C3 = ""C2 holds in the next state."" Since C2 is false at every state, C3 is false.

4. C4 = ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 is never true, so C4 is false.

5. C5 = ""C4 eventually holds."" C4 is never true, so C5 is false.

6. C6 = ""C5 always holds."" C5 is false (not holding now or ever), so ""always C5"" is false.

7. C7 = ""C6 holds in the next state."" C6 is false, so C7 is false.

Therefore, C7 is False.

1. Context: Initially event2 happened. ""After event2, no other events can happen"" (as in the examples) means once in the event2 state it stays at event2 forever. Also ""After event1, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant because event1 never occurs in the given run. So the (only) trace is: event2 holds now and at every future state.

2. C1: ""Event1 always happens."" That requires event1 to be true in every state. But the initial state has event2 (not event1), and event1 never occurs later. So C1 is false.

3. C2: same as C1, so C2 is false.

4. C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" The antecedent holds (event2 is true initially), but C2 is false, so the implication is false. Thus C3 is false.

5. C4: ""C1 or C3"" — both are false, so C4 is false.

6. C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" Since C4 is false in every state, it never eventually holds, so C5 is false.

7. C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" C5 is false everywhere, so C6 is false.

8. C7: ""C6 always holds."" Since C6 is false, C7 is false.

Therefore C7 is False."
