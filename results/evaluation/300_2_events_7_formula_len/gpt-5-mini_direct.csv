Reason: From the context the states alternate: initial state has event1, next has event2, then event1, etc. 
- C1 (""event1 in the next state"") is false at the initial state (next state has event2). 
- C2 (""C1 in the next state"") is true at the initial state (because from the next state event1 does occur afterwards). 
- C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false (C2 holds only in alternating states).

Explanation: From the context the system alternates: initially event2, then event1 next, then event2, etc. Thus ""eventually event1"" (C4) is true and holds in the next state (C5). Hence C6 (event1 now OR C5) is true, so C7 (""C6 does not hold"") is false."

C7: C6 always holds.","=== Context ===

Initially, event2 happened. After event2, no other events can happen. After event1, no other events can happen.

=== Hypothesis ===

C1: Event1 always happens.
C2: Event1 always happens.
C3: If event2 happens, then C2 holds.
C4: C1 holds or C3 holds.
C5: C4 eventually holds.
C6: C5 holds in the next state.
C7: C6 always holds.

C7 is True or False?
