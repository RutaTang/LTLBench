Short answer: True

Brief justification (no internal chain-of-thought): C1 and C2 are identical (""Event2 always happens""). C3 and C4 are both of the form ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"", i.e. P → P, which is a tautology and therefore true regardless of whether C1 actually holds. Since C3 and C4 are true, their conjunction C5 is true.
---
Step 1 — identify the statements:
- C1: ""Event2 always happens.""
- C2: ""Event2 always happens."" (same as C1)
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" (i.e. C1 → C2)
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" (same as C3)
- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" (C3 ∧ C4)

Step 2 — evaluate C3 and C4:
- C1 and C2 are the same proposition P (""Event2 always happens"").
- C3 is P → P, which is a logical tautology (always true).
- C4 is the same tautology, so it is also always true.

Step 3 — conclude C5:
- C5 = C3 ∧ C4 = true ∧ true = true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C5 (""C3 holds and C4 holds"") is True or False.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 always happens.""
- C2: ""Event2 always happens."" (identical to C1)
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" i.e. ""If (Event2 always happens) then (Event2 always happens).""
- C4: same as C3.

Step 3 — logical reasoning
- C3 and C4 are implications whose antecedent and consequent are the same statement. An implication p -> p is always true (a tautology), regardless of whether p itself is true.
- Therefore C3 is true and C4 is true.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C5 = (C3 and C4) is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret context
- Initially event2 happens.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so whenever event1 holds at time t, event2 holds at t+1, hence event1 does not hold at t+1).
- After event2, event1 must happen (they alternate starting with event2).

Step 2 — simplify the conditions
- C1: event1 or event1 ≡ event1.
- C2: same ≡ event1.
- C3: event1 or C2 ≡ event1.
- C4: C3 holds in the next state ≡ next(event1).
- C5: C4 does not hold ≡ not next(event1).
- C6: if event1 happens then C5 holds ≡ event1 -> not next(event1).
- C7: if C1 holds then C6 holds ≡ event1 -> (event1 -> not next(event1)) which is equivalent to event1 -> not next(event1) (same as C6).

Step 3 — evaluate against the context
- From ""after event1, event2 must happen"", whenever event1 holds at time t, event1 does not hold at t+1, so not next(event1) is true whenever event1 is true. Thus C6 is true, and therefore C7 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. What is asked: is C7 true or false given the context? C7 states: ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds.""

2. Simplify the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" ≡ Event1. (redundant disjunction)
- C2 is the same, so C2 ≡ Event1.
- C3: ""Event1 or C2"" ≡ Event1.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" ≡ next(Event1).
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" ≡ ¬next(Event1).
- C6: ""If event1 happens, then C5 holds"" ≡ Event1 → ¬next(Event1).
- C7: ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds"" ≡ Event1 → (Event1 → ¬next(Event1)), which is equivalent to Event1 → ¬next(Event1).

3. Use the context: initially event2 happened, and the rules say after event2 must come event1, and after event1 must come event2. So events strictly alternate: ..., event2, event1, event2, event1, ... In any state where Event1 holds, the next state must be event2, so next(Event1) is false; hence Event1 → ¬next(Event1) is true in those states. In states where Event1 does not hold, the implication is trivially true.

Therefore C7 is true.
---
Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Initially event2 happened (state 0).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so state 1 has event1).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so state 2 has event2).
Thus the events alternate: state indices 0,1,2,3,... have events 2,1,2,1,...

Step 2 — simplify conditions (all evaluated at a given state unless a ""next"" is present):
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" ≡ Event1.
- C2: same as C1 ≡ Event1.
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds"" ≡ Event1.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" ≡ Next(Event1). So C4 is true exactly at states whose next state has event1 (i.e. even states).
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" ≡ not Next(Event1) (true at odd states).
- C6: ""If event1 happens, then C5 holds"" ≡ Event1 -> not Next(Event1). In the alternating sequence, every state with event1 (odd states) is followed by event2, so Next(Event1) is false there; thus C6 is true at all states.
- C7: ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds"" ≡ Event1 -> C6.

Step 3 — evaluate C7:
- C6 is true at every state (see above).
- Therefore Event1 -> C6 is true at every state (an implication with a true consequent is always true).
So C7 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning, step by step:

- Context: event2 happened initially, and after event2 no other events can ever happen. Therefore event1 never happens in any state.
- So C1, C2, C3 (all ""Event1 does not happen"") are true.
- C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is true because event1 never happens in any future state.
- C5 (""If C4 holds, then event2 happens"") is true as well: C4 is true and event2 has happened (initially), so the implication holds.
- C6 (""C2 holds or C5 holds"") is true (both disjuncts are true).
- C7 (""If C1 holds, then C6 holds""): antecedent C1 is true and consequent C6 is true, so the implication C7 is true.
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
C7 is the statement: ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds."" We must decide True or False.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1, C2, C3: all assert the same proposition: ""Event1 does not happen."" Call this proposition p.
- C4: p holds in the next state (not needed for the final truth but consistent).
- C5: If C4 then event2 happens (call this q).
- C6: C2 holds or C5 holds, i.e. p or q.
- C7: If C1 holds then C6 holds, i.e. p -> (p or q).

Step 3 — logical reasoning
For any propositions p and q, p -> (p or q) is a tautology: whenever p is true, (p or q) is certainly true. Thus C7 is always true regardless of the background event rules.

Final answer: True
---
Goal: decide whether C7 (""If C1 holds, then C6 holds"") is true or false.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- C1, C2, and C3 are the same statement: ""Event1 does not happen."" So C1 and C2 are identical propositions.
- C6 is ""C2 holds or C5 holds"" i.e. C6 = C2 ∨ C5.
- From C1 (which is the same as C2) we immediately get C2.
- If C2 is true, then C2 ∨ C5 is true, so C6 is true.
- Hence whenever C1 holds, C6 holds. That means C7 (C1 -> C6) is logically valid.
- The contextual facts about events do not affect this logical implication because C7 follows from the definitions of C1, C2, and C6 alone.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C7 is true or false.

1) What C7 says: ""C6 holds in the next state."" C6 is the implication (C2 → C5). So we need to know whether, in the successor state of the initial state, C2 → C5 is true.

2) Understand the context and the C-conditions:
- Context: initially event2 occurred, and the rules are ""after event1, event2 must happen"" and ""after event2, event1 must happen."" So the system alternates event2, event1, event2, event1, ...
- C1, C3, C4 are all the same: ""Event1 eventually happens"" (F event1).
  Because of the alternation and the initial event2, event1 does indeed occur at the next step, and in fact at every state there is an eventual event1. So C1, C3, C4 are true at every state.
- C5 = C3 ∧ C4 is therefore true at every state.
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" i.e. F(C1) = F(F event1). In linear temporal logic F(F p) is equivalent to F p, so C2 is equivalent to C1 and thus true at every state as well.
- Hence at any state C2 is true and C5 is true, so the implication C6 (C2 → C5) is true at every state.

3) Therefore C6 is true in the successor state, so C7 (""C6 holds in the next state"") is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
C7 asserts that the formula (C2 -> C5) holds in the next state. We must decide whether that is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context and the Ci
- Context: initially event2 has happened. Also: after any event1, event2 must happen (eventually); after any event2, event1 must happen (eventually). So from the initial state (where event2 just happened) it follows that event1 will eventually occur, and this alternation continues.
- C1: ""event1 eventually happens"" (F event1).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (F C1), i.e. F F event1.
- C3, C4: same as C1.
- C5: C3 ∧ C4, so equivalent to C1 ∧ C1, hence equivalent to C1.
- C6: (C2 -> C5).
- C7: X C6 (C6 holds in the next state).

Step 3 — simplify and evaluate
- In temporal logic F F p ≡ F p, so C2 ≡ C1.
- Therefore C5 ≡ C1, and C2 ≡ C1, so C6 is (C1 -> C1), which is always true in any state where C1 is well-defined (in fact a tautology).
- At the initial state, C1 is true because after the initial event2, event1 must eventually happen. Thus C2, C3, C4, C5 are true initially and hence C6 is true initially.
- At the next state: because after event2 event1 must still eventually occur, C1 is true at the next state as well. By the same simplifications, C6 is true at the next state.

Conclusion
C7 is True.
---
Step 1 — understand the context
- Initially event2 occurred.
- After any event1, event2 must occur later.
- After any event2, event1 must occur later.
From this we get an infinite alternating sequence starting with event2: event2 (initial), then event1, then event2, then event1, ...

Step 2 — simplify the conditions
- C1, C3, C4 are all the same: ""event1 eventually happens.""
- C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"" = ""eventually (event1 eventually happens)"". In linear-time temporal logic F F p = F p, so C2 is equivalent to C1.
- C5 = C3 ∧ C4 = (event1 eventually) ∧ (event1 eventually) = event1 eventually (i.e., equivalent to C1).
- C6 = (if C2 then C5). Since C2 ≡ C1 and C5 ≡ C1, C6 reduces to (if C1 then C1), which is trivially true whenever the formulas are evaluated.

Step 3 — evaluate C6 in the next state
- In the next state after the initial (where event1 occurs), C1 is true (event1 has happened/ will hold from that state).
- Therefore C2 is true there as well, and C5 is true there as well; hence the implication C6 holds in that next state.

Conclusion
C7 (""C6 holds in the next state"") is True."

Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Setup and interpretation
- We start in the initial state (state0) where event1 has happened.
- The context says “after event1, no other events can happen,” so from state0 onward no events (including event2) can ever occur.
- “Next state” is the state immediately after the current one (so from state0 it is state1).

2. Evaluate the Ci formulas at the initial point
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state.” Since no events can happen after event1, event2 does not happen in the next state → C1 is false.
- C2: same as C1 → false.
- C3: “C2 holds or event2 happens.” Both disjuncts are false → C3 is false.
- C4: “C3 always holds.” C3 is already false at the initial state, so C4 is false.
- C5: “C1 holds or C4 holds.” Both false → C5 is false.
- C6: “C5 always holds.” C5 is false, so C6 is false.
- C7: “C6 does not hold.” Since C6 is false, C7 is true.

Therefore C7 is True.
---
Sorry—I can’t provide a detailed step-by-step chain-of-thought. I can, however, give a concise answer and a short summary of the reasoning.

Summary:
- Premise: initially event1 has already happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. So no future event2 can occur (including the next state).
- Therefore C1 and C2 (event2 happens next) are false.
- C3 (C2 or event2) is false; C4 (C3 always) is false; C5 (C1 or C4) is false; C6 (C5 always) is false.
- C7 is ""C6 does not hold"" — since C6 is false, C7 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Initially event1 happened (at time 0).
- The context says: after event1, no other events can happen. So at the next state (time 1) no events occur — in particular, event2 does not happen at the next state.
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" — False.
- C2: same as C1 — False.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" — Both disjuncts are false, so C3 is False.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" — Since C3 is already false, C4 is False.
- C5: ""C1 holds or C4 holds."" — Both false, so C5 is False.
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" — False.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" — True (because C6 is false).

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s asked
We must decide whether C6 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — understand the conditions
- Context: initially event1 happens; after event1, event2 must happen; after event2, event1 must happen. So states alternate: event1 at t0, event2 at t1, event1 at t2, ...
- C1: event1 → event1 (tautology; true whenever evaluated).
- C2: event2 ∧ C1 (so C2 is equivalent to “event2 holds” at that state, since C1 is always true).
- C3: same as C2 (event2 ∧ C1).
- C4: C3 holds in the next state (i.e., event2 holds in the next state).
- C5: C2 ∨ C4 (event2 now, or event2 in the next state).
- C6: C5 ∨ event1 (either (event2 now or next) or event1 now).

Step 3 — evaluate at the initial state
- Initially event1 is true.
- Because event1 is true now, C6 = (C5) ∨ event1 is immediately true (event1 holds).
- Also, from the rule “after event1, event2 must happen,” event2 holds at the next state, so C4 is true and hence C5 is true as well — another route to C6 being true.

Conclusion
True
---
Step 1 — interpret the context as a timeline:
- State 0 (initial): event1 holds.
- The rules ""after event1, event2 must happen"" and ""after event2, event1 must happen"" force alternation: state0 event1, state1 event2, state2 event1, state3 event2, … (event1 on even states, event2 on odd states).

Step 2 — evaluate conditions statewise (truth at a given state s):
- C1: (event1 → event1). This is a tautology and so holds in every state.
- C2: event2 ∧ C1. Since C1 holds everywhere, C2 is equivalent to event2, so C2 is true exactly in the odd states.
- C3: same as C2, true in the odd states.
- C4: next(C3). C4 is true at state s iff C3 is true at s+1. C3 is true at odd states, so C4 is true at those states s whose next state is odd — i.e. at even states. Thus C4 is true exactly at the even states (the same states where event1 holds).
- C5: C2 ∨ C4. C2 covers odd states, C4 covers even states, so C5 is true in every state.
- C6: C5 ∨ event1. Since C5 already holds in every state, C6 holds in every state.

Conclusion: C6 is True.
---
We are asked whether C6 holds (True or False) given the context and the conditions C1–C5.

Step 1 — what is being asked
- Determine whether C6 is true under the given context (initial event1, and the two ""after"" rules).

Step 2 — simplify the conditions
- C1: (event1 → event1) — a tautology, so C1 always holds.
- C2: event2 ∧ C1 ≡ event2.
- C3: event2 ∧ C1 ≡ event2 (same as C2).
- C4: C3 holds in the next state ≡ X(event2) (next-state event2).
- C5: C2 ∨ C4 ≡ event2 ∨ X(event2).
- C6: C5 ∨ event1 ≡ event1 ∨ event2 ∨ X(event2).

Step 3 — use the context
- Initially event1 holds.
- The rules ""after event1, event2 must happen"" and ""after event2, event1 must happen"" force alternation: starting from the initial state with event1, the next state has event2, the next has event1, etc. Thus every state has either event1 or event2 true.

Step 4 — evaluate C6
- Since in every state either event1 or event2 holds, C6 = (event1 ∨ event2 ∨ X event2) is true in every state (in particular in the initial state).

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret formulas:
- C1 is ""if event2 happens, then event2 happens"" (a propostional tautology p -> p).
- C2 says C1 always holds (so C1 is true in every state).
- C3 says C2 holds in the next state (but if C2 holds globally, it holds in the next state).
- C4 asserts that C3 does not hold.
- C5 repeats the tautology of C1.
- C6 is ""if C4 holds, then C5 holds"" (an implication whose antecedent is C4).
- C7 is ""C6 eventually holds.""

Step 2 — evaluate truth:
- C1 is a tautology, so C2 (C1 always holds) is true.
- Therefore C3 (C2 holds in the next state) is true.
- Hence C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is false.
- C5 is a tautology, so true.
- C6 is an implication with a false antecedent (C4), so C6 is true (vacuously).
- Since C6 already holds (indeed holds always), C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is true.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautological implication and holds in every state.
2. C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 holds in every state, C2 is true.
3. C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Because C2 holds in all states, it also holds in the next state, so C3 is true (in every state).
4. C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This contradicts step 3, so C4 is false (in every state).
5. C5: same as C1, so true.
6. C6: ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds."" An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C6 is true (in every state).
7. C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" Because C6 already holds (indeed always), it certainly holds eventually.

Therefore C7 is True.
---
Goal: decide whether C7 is True or False.

Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Initially event2 occurs (time t0).
- After event2, event1 must occur (so at t1 event1).
- After event1, event2 must occur (so at t2 event2), and so on.
Thus the timeline is an infinite alternation: t0: event2, t1: event1, t2: event2, t3: event1, …

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions on that timeline:
- C1: (event2 -> event2). This is a tautology (p -> p). It holds at every state.
- C2: C1 always holds. Since C1 holds at every state, C2 is true (globally).
- C3: C2 holds in the next state. Because C2 is globally true, it holds at the next state as well. So C3 is true at every state.
- C4: C3 does not hold. This contradicts C3; thus C4 is false at every state.
- C5: (event2 -> event2). Same as C1, true everywhere.
- C6: If C4 holds, then C5 holds (C4 -> C5). Since C4 is false everywhere, the implication is true everywhere.
- C7: C6 eventually holds. Because C6 holds already (indeed always), “eventually C6” is true.

Conclusion: C7 is True.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. C5: ""C4 always holds"" — this asserts C4 unconditionally (C4 is true).
2. C6: ""C5 always holds"" — this asserts C5 unconditionally (C5 is true). Thus C6 is true as a fact.
3. An implication with a true consequent is true. Since C6 is true regardless of C1, the implication ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds"" (C7) is true.
(As an alternative observation: the context also makes C1 false, so C7 would be vacuously true as well.)
---
We want the truth value of C7: ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds.""

Step 1 — interpret the context
- The context says event2 happened (initially).
- So the proposition ""Event2 does not happen"" (C1 and C2) is false in this context.

Step 2 — evaluate the other conditions
- C2 is false (same as C1).
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds."" event2 does happen, and C3 is true, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" Given C4 is true, C5 is true.
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" Given C5 is true, C6 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C7
- C7 is ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds."" C1 is false in the context, so the implication is vacuously true. (Also C6 is actually true regardless.)

Final answer: True
---
Goal: decide whether C7 (""If C1 holds, then C6 holds"") is true or false.

Step 1 — facts from the context
- Initially, event2 happened. So ""event2 happened"" is true.
- After event2, event1 must happen. So event1 happens (after event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen. (This does not affect the truth of the C-claims except confirming event1 occurs.)

Step 2 — evaluate each Ci
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This contradicts the context, so C1 is false.
- C2: ""Event2 does not happen."" Same as C1, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" Since C2 is false, the implication C2 ⇒ event1 is vacuously true. So C3 is true.
- C4: ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds."" Event2 does happen, and C3 is true, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" That asserts C4 is true — consistent, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" That asserts C5 is true — consistent, so C6 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C7
- C7: ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds."" The antecedent C1 is false. In classical logic, an implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuous truth). Also C6 is true anyway. Therefore C7 is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C6 (""If C5 holds, then event1 happens"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
=> Therefore event1 does not happen (it cannot occur after the initial event2).

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" True (from the context).
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" False (cannot have event1 happen and not happen simultaneously).
- C3: same as C2. False.
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" False (both C2 and C3 are false).
- C5: ""Event1 happens and C4 holds."" False (C4 is false, and event1 does not happen).
- C6: ""If C5 holds, then event1 happens."" This is an implication. Since C5 is false, the implication is vacuously true (a material conditional with a false antecedent is true).

Final answer: True

Step 1 — What’s being asked
C6 is the statement ""If C5 holds, then event1 happens."" We must determine whether C6 is true or false given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — Use the context
""Initially, event2 happened. After event2, no other events can happen."" Therefore event1 does not happen. So C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is true.

Step 3 — Examine the conditions
- C2 and C3 both assert ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Since C1 says event1 does not happen, C2 and C3 are contradictory and thus false.
- C4 is ""C2 or C3"" — false because both C2 and C3 are false.
- C5 is ""Event1 happens and C4 holds"" — false because C4 is false (and also event1 does not happen).

Step 4 — Evaluate C6
C6 is the implication ""If C5 holds, then event1 happens."" An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously). Also note that by its definition C5 already includes ""event1 happens"" as a conjunct, so C5 → event1 is logically valid in any case.

Final answer
True

True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. So event1 does not happen.
- C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is true.
- C2 and C3 (""Event1 happens and C1 holds"") are false (they require event1 to happen while C1 says it doesn't).
- C4 (""C2 or C3"") is false.
- C5 (""Event1 happens and C4 holds"") is false.
- C6 is the implication ""If C5 holds, then event1 happens."" Since C5 is false, the implication is vacuously true (and also, by C5's content, would directly entail event1). Therefore C6 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Assume “after” means “in the next state” (the usual reading in these stepwise temporal problems). Let times be t0 (initial), t1, t2, ...

1. From the context: at t0 event1 holds.
2. “After event1, event2 must happen” means: whenever event1 holds at some time, event2 holds at the next time. So since event1 holds at t0, event2 must hold at t1.
3. “After event2, event1 must happen” similarly forces event1 at the successor of any state with event2. Combining 2 and 3 gives an alternating pattern: t0: event1, t1: event2, t2: event1, t3: event2, … In particular, at every time at least one of event1 or event2 holds.

Now evaluate the Ci:

- C2: “event2 or event1” — true at every time in the alternating trace, so C2 holds now and always.
- C3: “C2 always holds” — true.
- C1: “event2 or event1” at the current state — true (holds at t0).
- C4: C1 and C3 — true.
- C5: “C4 always holds” — since C1 holds at every time and C3 is global, C4 holds at every time, so C5 is true.
- C6: “C5 holds in the next state” — C5 holds at all states, so it holds in the next state; C6 is true.
- C7: “C6 holds in the next state” — at t1, C6 is true (because C5 holds at all times, so at t2 C5 holds and thus at t1 C6 is true), so C7 (which asserts C6 at t1) is true.

Therefore C7 is True. Final answer: True
---

---
Reasoning:

1. From the context: initially event1 occurs. The rules ""after event2, event1 must happen"" and ""after event1, event2 must happen"" force an alternation: every state has at least one of event1 or event2, and if one happens at time t the other happens at t+1. With event1 at the initial state, the sequence can be event1, event2, event1, event2, ... so at every state (including the initial) event1 ∨ event2 holds.

2. C1 and C2 are both the proposition ""event2 or event1"". By (1) C1 and C2 hold at every state.

3. C3 is ""C2 always holds"" — true because C2 holds at every state.

4. C4 is ""C1 holds and C3 holds"". Since C1 holds at the current state and C3 holds globally, C4 holds at every state.

5. C5 is ""C4 always holds"" — true because C4 holds at every state.

6. C6 is ""C5 holds in the next state"". Since C5 is global, it holds in the next state, so C6 holds now.

7. C7 is ""C6 holds in the next state"". Because C6 holds at every next-state (by the same global propagation), C7 holds now.

Therefore C7 is True.

---
Step 1 — what is being asked
You asked whether C6 is True or False under the given context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
(We can ignore the redundant ""After event2, no other events can happen"" because event2 will never occur given the second bullet.)

From these facts: because event1 has already happened and no events can occur after event1, event2 cannot happen at any time.

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" — False (event2 cannot occur).
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" — False (requires event2 and C1; C1 is false).
- C3: same as C2 — False.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event1 happens."" — True. An implication with a false antecedent is true (and in fact event1 already did happen).
- C5: ""C2 holds and C4 holds."" — False (C2 is false).
- C6: ""If C5 holds, then event2 happens."" — True, because its antecedent C5 is false, so the implication is vacuously true.

Final answer
True

We are asked whether C6 (""If C5 holds, then event2 happens"") is true given the context.

Step-by-step:

- From context: initially event1 happened. Also after event1 no other events can happen. Therefore event2 cannot happen at any time. So ""event2 eventually happens"" is false.
- C1 (""Event2 eventually happens"") — False.
- C2 (""Event2 happens and C1 holds"") — requires event2 to happen and C1 true; since event2 does not happen and C1 is false, C2 is False.
- C3 (""Event2 happens and C1 holds"") — identical to C2, so False.
- C4 (""If C3 holds, then event1 happens"") — an implication with a false antecedent (C3 is false), so C4 is True (vacuously).
- C5 (""C2 holds and C4 holds"") — C2 is false, C4 true, so C5 is False.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the context implies about events
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
Therefore event1 does not happen (there is no time at which event1 can occur, because event2 already occurred first and blocks any further events).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" — True (from Step 1).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" — True, since C1 is a factual statement that event1 never occurs, it holds at all times.
- C3: ""Event1 does not happen."" — True (same as C1).
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" — True: both antecedent and consequent are true, so the implication is true.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" — True, since C4 is true and nothing in the context makes it time-dependent.
- C6: ""Event1 does not happen."" — True (same as C1/C3).

Step 3 — evaluate C7
- C7: ""If C5 holds, then C6 holds."" C5 is true and C6 is true, so the implication is true.

True

- After event2 no other events can happen. So once event2 has occurred (at the initial moment) there are no further events at any later time.
- Therefore event1 never happens at any time.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" True (from the context).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" True, because C1 is true at all times (event1 never happens).
- C3: ""Event1 does not happen."" True (same as C1).
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" True (both antecedent and consequent are true).
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" True (C4 is true and nothing changes later).
- C6: ""Event1 does not happen."" True (same as C1).
- C7: ""If C5 holds, then C6 holds."" Antecedent (C5) is true and consequent (C6) is true, so the implication is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
- We must determine whether C7 (""If C5 holds, then C6 holds"") is true or false given the context and the listed conditions.

Step 2 — use the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2 no other events can happen ⇒ event1 did not happen (and cannot happen).

Step 3 — evaluate conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" — True (from context).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" — True (since event1 never happens in the given scenario).
- C3: ""Event1 does not happen."" — True (same as C1).
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" — True (antecedent true and consequent true).
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" — True (C4 is true and remains true).
- C6: ""Event1 does not happen."" — True (same as C1/C3).
- C7: ""If C5 holds, then C6 holds."" — True (antecedent C5 is true and consequent C6 is true, so the implication holds).

C7 is True.

Brief justification (concise): From the context event1 happened initially, so ""Event1 does not happen"" (C1/C2/C4) is false. After event1 no other events can happen, so event2 is false. Thus C3 = (event2 or C2) is false, C5 (C3 → C4) is true (vacuously), and C6 = (event2 and C5) is false. Since C1 is false, the implication C7 (if C1 then C6) is true.
---
Step 1 — from the context:
- ""Initially, event1 happened."" => Event1 is true.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Since event1 happened initially, no other events (including event2) can happen afterward => Event2 is false.
- The rule ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 does not occur.

Step 2 — evaluate each Ci:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" False (event1 does happen).
- C2: same as C1, False.
- C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" Both parts false, so C3 is False.
- C4: ""Event1 does not happen."" False.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" Antecedent C3 is false, so the implication is true (vacuously).
- C6: ""Event2 happens and C5 holds."" Event2 is false, so C6 is False.
- C7: ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds."" Antecedent C1 is false, so the implication is true (vacuously).

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The context states ""Initially, event1 happened."" So ""Event1 does not happen"" (C1) is false.
- An implication ""If C1 then C6"" is vacuously true whenever C1 is false, regardless of C6's truth value.
- Therefore C7 (""If C1 holds, then C6 holds"") is true."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — understand the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- Rule: after event2, event1 must happen.
- Rule: after event1, no other events can happen.
Because event1 happened initially and no events can occur after event1, event2 cannot happen at any time.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — equivalent to ""event2 happens"". Since event2 cannot happen, C1 is False.
- C2: same as C1, so False.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" This is an implication with a false antecedent (C1 is False), so C3 is True (vacuously).
- C4: same as C3, so True.
- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" Both are True, so C5 is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C5 (""C3 holds and C4 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen — so once event1 has occurred, event2 cannot occur at any later time.
- Therefore, in the given scenario, event2 never happens.

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — equivalent to ""event2 happens."" Given the context, C1 is false.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" This is an implication C1 → C2. An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously true). Since C1 is false, C3 is true.
- C4: identical to C3, so C4 is also true.

Step 4 — conclude about C5
- C5 is ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" Both C3 and C4 are true, so C5 is true.

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — what’s asked
- We must decide whether C5 (C3 holds and C4 holds) is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context

- Rule: after event2, event1 must happen.
- Rule: after event1, no other events can happen.
- Because event1 happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, no further events (including event2) can occur at any later time.

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: “Event2 happens and event2 happens” — equivalent to “Event2 happens.” Given the context, event2 cannot happen, so C1 is false.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is false.
- C3: “If C1 holds, then C2 holds.” An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true, so C3 is true.
- C4: same as C3, so C4 is true.
- C5: “C3 holds and C4 holds.” Since both C3 and C4 are true, C5 is true.

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. So there are no future states with any events.
- C1 (event1 eventually happens) is false, because event1 never occurs.
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false (C1 does not hold now).

- C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is false because there is no next state after the initial event2.
- C5 is the same as C1, so false.
- C6 (C4 and C5) is false (both conjuncts false).
- C7 (""C6 does not hold"") is therefore true.
---
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Context: initially event2 has happened, and after either event1 or event2 no further events can occur. So the system starts in a terminal state where event2 has already occurred; event1 can never occur at any future point.

- C1 (Event1 eventually happens): False (event1 cannot happen after the initial event2).

- C2 (C1 always holds): False (since C1 is already false in the initial/only reachable state).

- C3 (C2 does not hold): True (negation of C2).

- C5 (Event1 eventually happens): same as C1, so False.

- C4 (C3 holds in the next state): regardless of how one treats ""next"" in a terminal state, C5 is already False, so C6 (C4 and C5) is False.

- C7 (C6 does not hold): True (negation of C6).

Thus C7 is True.
---
True

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Context: initially event2 has happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. Therefore, from the initial state the system terminates immediately and no occurrence of event1 can ever happen.

- C1 (""Event1 eventually happens""): false, because event1 never occurs after the initial event2.

- C2 (""C1 always holds""): false, since C1 is false already in the initial (and only) state.

- C3 (""C2 does not hold""): true, because C2 is false.

- C4 (""C3 holds in the next state""): false. There is no next state (no further events possible after the initial state), so ""next"" statements are not satisfied.

- C5 (""Event1 eventually happens""): same as C1, false.

- C6 (""C4 holds and C5 holds""): false, since both conjuncts are false.

- C7 (""C6 does not hold""): true, because C6 is false.

Thus C7 is True."

Step 1 — what’s asked
C7 is the disjunction ""C1 holds or C6 holds."" We must determine if that disjunction is true given the scenario.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautological implication (P → P) and therefore holds in any state. So C1 is true.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is also true.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" From the initial state (where event2 happened) the next state has event1; C2 is true in that next state (it’s tautological), so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" The state after the one where event1 happened has no events, but C3 (which just asserts C2 holds in the next state) is still true there because C2 is tautological in any subsequent state. So C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" By the same reasoning, C4 is true in further next states, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" Since C5 does hold, C6 is false.

Step 3 — conclude C7
C7 = (C1 holds) or (C6 holds). C1 is true, C6 is false, so the disjunction is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C7 (C1 holds or C6 holds) is True or False at the initial situation.

Step 2 — model the scenario briefly
- Let s0 be the initial state (event2 happened).
- By the context, at s1 (the state after s0) event1 must happen.
- After that (after event1) no further events can happen, so there is no meaningful further state s2 with events.

Step 3 — examine the conditions at the initial state s0
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a logical tautology (event1 → event1), so C1 is true at every state including s0.
- C2: same as C1, also true.
- C3, C4, C5 refer to truths in next states; some of them may fail because there is no s2, but we do not need their exact truth to decide C7.
- C6 is ""C5 does not hold."" Whether C6 is true or false does not matter once we know C1 is true.

Step 4 — conclusion
- Since C1 is true at s0, the disjunction C7 = (C1 holds) OR (C6 holds) is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- “After event1, no other events can happen” ⇒ once event1 has occurred, no event (including event2) can occur in any later state.
- Therefore event2 never occurs at any time.

Step 2 — evaluate C1–C5
- C1, C2, C3: “Event2 always happens” — false, because event2 never occurs.
- C4 = C2 or C3 — false.
- C5 = C1 or C4 — false.

Step 3 — evaluate C6
- C6: “If C5 holds, then event1 happens.” C5 is false, so the implication is true (classical logic: false ⇒ anything is true). Thus C6 is true in the current state.

Step 4 — evaluate C7
- C7: “C6 holds in the next state.” Even though no further events occur after event1, there is a next state whose events are simply none; in that next state C5 is still false, so the implication C6 is true there as well. Therefore C7 is true.

(If one instead assumes “there is no next state” so the next-state formula is undefined, the answer could differ; under the usual temporal semantics that a next state exists, C7 is True.)

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- C7 asserts: ""C6 holds in the next state."" We must decide whether that is true given the scenario.

Step 2 — examine the facts about the system
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so the initial state is terminal; there is no next state).
- After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant if event2 never occurs after the initial event1).

Step 3 — evaluate C1–C6 in the initial state
- C1, C2, C3 each say ""Event2 always happens."" Because event1 has already happened and after event1 no events can happen, event2 cannot happen after the initial state, so the ""event2 always happens"" claims are false. Hence C1, C2, C3 are false.
- C4 = C2 or C3 is false.
- C5 = C1 or C4 is false.
- C6 = (if C5 then event1). An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C6 is true in the initial (current) state.

Step 4 — evaluate C7 (""C6 holds in the next state"")
- There is no next state (the initial state is terminal). In standard temporal semantics, ""holds in the next state"" is false in a state that has no next state. Therefore C7 is false.

Final answer: False
---
True

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

- Context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. So event2 cannot occur at any time.
- C1, C2, C3 (""Event2 always happens"") are therefore false.
- C4 = C2 or C3 → false. C5 = C1 or C4 → false.
- C6 = (If C5 then event1). An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C6 is true (both now and in any following state, since C5 remains false).

- After event1, no other events can happen → once event1 has happened, event2 cannot happen later.
- After event2, no other events can happen (not needed, but it also would block events after event2).

Because event1 happened initially, event2 cannot happen at any time.

C6 is True.

Reasoning:

- C1 (""event1 and event1"") is true (equivalent to event1).
- C2 and C3 both require event2; since event2 cannot happen, C2 and C3 are false.
- C4 (C2 or C3) is false.
- C5 (event2 and C4) is false.
- C6 is ""C5 does not hold"" — since C5 is false, C6 is true.

- C4: ""C2 or C3"" — both false, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""Event2 happens and C4 holds"" — requires event2 and C4; C4 is false and event2 does not happen, so C5 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — model the timeline
- Let s0, s1, s2, ... be the sequence of states.
- By the premises: E1 (event1) happens in s0. After E1 no other events can ever happen, so for every n ≥ 1 no events occur in sn (in particular E1 is false in s1, s2, ...). Event2 never occurs.

Step 2 — interpret the Ci formulas (standard linear-time operators)
- ""always"" = G, ""eventually"" = F, ""next"" = X. Let E1 be the proposition ""event1 happens in the current state"".
- C1 = G E1 (E1 holds at every state).
- C2 = F C1 = F(G E1).
- C3 = X C2.
- C4 = X C3.
- C5 = F C4.
- C6 = X C5.
- C7 = G C6.

Step 3 — evaluate at each state
- E1 is true at s0 and false at every s_n for n ≥ 1.
- C1 = G E1 is false at s0 (because E1 is false at s1), and false at every state.
- C2 = F C1 is false (there is no future state where C1 holds).
- C3 = X C2 is false (C2 is false at s1).
- C4 = X C3 is false.
- C5 = F C4 is false (C4 never holds).
- C6 = X C5 is false.
- C7 = G C6 is false at s0 (since C6 is false already at s0).

Conclusion
C7 is False.

---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step, brief):

- Context forces that from the initial state (where event1 happened) no further change can occur, so event1 holds at the initial state and in all subsequent states (the system remains in a state where event1 has happened).
- C1 (event1 always happens, i.e. G event1) is therefore true.
- C2 (eventually C1, F C1) is true because C1 already holds immediately.
- C3 (next C2, X C2) is true because in the next state C1 still holds, so C2 still holds.
- C4 (next C3) and similarly C5 (eventually C4), C6 (next C5) all hold by the same persistence argument.
- Finally, C7 (always C6, G C6) holds because C6 holds at every state.

Thus C7 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s asked
- We must decide whether C7 (""If C5 holds, then C6 holds"") is true given the scenario and the listed conditions.

Step 2 — evaluate the relevant conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (A → A) and so is true.
- C6: same as C1, so C6 is also a tautology and therefore true in any state.
- C7 is the implication C5 → C6.

Step 3 — conclude
- An implication with a true consequent is always true (whether or not the antecedent C5 holds). Since C6 is true, C7 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Reasoning (concise):

- Initially event2 happens; after that no events occur, so in the initial state event2 is true and in the next state neither event1 nor event2 holds.
- C1 and C6 are propositions of the form (event1 → event1), tautologically true in any state.
- C2 = (event2 ∧ C1) is true in the initial state (event2 holds there) but false in the next state.
- C3 = (C2 ∨ event1) is true initially (because C2 is) and false in the next state.
- C4 = “always C3” is false (C3 does not hold in the next state).
- C5 = “C4 holds in the next state” is therefore false in the initial state.
- C7 is (C5 → C6). Since C5 is false in the initial state and C6 is true, the implication C7 is true (an implication with a false antecedent is true).

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify goal
- We must decide whether C7 (""If C5 holds, then C6 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event2 happened (so ""event2 happens"" is true at the initial state).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so in every state after the initial one, neither event1 nor event2 happens).
- After event1 no other events can happen (but event1 never occurs here because event2 already happened initially and prevents further events).

Step 3 — examine the statements
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a logical tautology (P → P), so C1 holds.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" Since event2 is true in the initial state and C1 holds, C2 is true in the initial state (but false in subsequent states because event2 does not hold later).
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" C3 is true in the initial state (because C2 is true) and false in later states (neither C2 nor event1 holds later).
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" This would require C3 to be true in every state. But C3 is false after the initial state, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" Since C4 is false (already), C5 is false.
- C6: same as C1, so C6 is a tautology and thus holds.

Step 4 — evaluate C7
- C7 is the implication ""If C5 holds, then C6 holds.""
- C5 is false in the actual run, so the implication is vacuously true (a false antecedent makes the implication true).
- Therefore C7 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Initially event2 happens, and after event2 no other events can happen, so event1 never happens.
- C1 (""event1 eventually happens"") is false. C2 is the same, so false. C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is false.
- C4 (""if C1 then C3"") is true (vacuously, because C1 is false).
- C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true because C4 already holds now.
- C6 (""event2 happens and C5 holds"") is true (event2 did happen and C5 is true).
- C7 (""if event2 happens, then C6 holds"") is true because event2 is true and C6 is true, so the implication holds.

Therefore C7 is True.
---
Step 1 — Understand context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So once event2 has happened (as it did initially), event1 can never happen.
- (Also “after event1 no other events can happen” is irrelevant because event1 never occurs given event2 occurred first.)

Step 2 — Evaluate the conditions
- C1: “Event1 eventually happens.” False (event2 already happened and prevents event1).
- C2: same as C1, False.
- C3: “C2 eventually holds.” Since C2 is never true, C3 is False.
- C4: “If C1 holds, then C3 holds.” This implication has a false antecedent (C1), so C4 is vacuously True.
- C5: “C4 eventually holds.” C4 already holds, so C5 is True.
- C6: “Event2 happens and C5 holds.” Event2 did happen and C5 is True, so C6 is True.
- C7: “If event2 happens, then C6 holds.” Event2 does happen, and C6 is True, so the implication is True.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 happened (so at the initial time event2 is true).
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" means once event2 has happened, no further events (including event1) can occur after that time.
- Therefore event1 cannot happen at any later time (and the context gives no indication event1 also happened initially).

Step 2 — evaluate each condition
- C1 (Event1 eventually happens): False — event1 never happens (event2 already happened and prevents further events).
- C2 is the same as C1: False.
- C3 (C2 eventually holds): False — since C2 is never true, there is no future time at which C2 becomes true.
- C4 (If C1 holds, then C3 holds): True — a material implication with a false antecedent is true.
- C5 (C4 eventually holds): True — C4 already holds now, so ""eventually C4"" is satisfied.
- C6 (Event2 happens and C5 holds): True — event2 does happen (initially) and C5 holds, so the conjunction is true.
- C7 (If event2 happens, then C6 holds): True — event2 does happen, and C6 is true, so the implication is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning, step by step:

- We are asked whether C6 (""If event2 happens, then C5 holds"") is true given the context.
- Context facts: initially event2 happened; after event1 no other events can happen; after event2 no other events can happen.
- C1 is ""if event1 happens, then event2 happens."" The context does not imply C1 (there is no information forcing event1 to imply event2), so we cannot conclude C1 holds.
- C2 is ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" Event2 does happen initially, but since C1 is not established, C2 does not hold.
- C3 is identical to C2, so C3 does not hold either.
- C4 is ""C3 holds in the next state."" Because after event2 no other events can happen, there is no next state where C3 could hold, so C4 does not hold.
- C5 is ""C2 or C4."" Both are false, so C5 is false.
- C6 asserts ""if event2 happens, then C5 holds."" But event2 does happen (initially) while C5 is false, so C6 is false.
---
Step 1 — what's asked
We must decide whether C6 (""If event2 happens, then C5 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event2 happened (so in the initial state event2 is true).
- After event1, no other events can happen (states where event1 happened are terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (states where event2 happened are terminal).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: If event1 happens, then event2 happens. Event1 never is asserted to occur anywhere, so this implication is vacuously true — C1 holds.
- C2: C1 holds and event2 happens. In the initial state C1 holds and event2 happens, so C2 is true in that state.
- C3: same as C2, so C3 is true in the initial state.
- C4: C3 holds in the next state. But after event2 no other events can happen, so there is no next state; therefore ""next C3"" is false. So C4 is false.
- C5: C2 holds or C4 holds. Since C2 is true in the state where event2 happened, C5 is true in that state.

Step 4 — evaluate C6
C6 says: if event2 happens, then C5 holds. In the relevant state(s) where event2 happens (including the initial state), we have shown C5 is true. Therefore the implication in C6 is true.

True

We are asked whether C7 (the statement ""If C5 holds, then C6 holds"") is true given the context.

1) From the context:
- Initially, event1 happened. So at the initial state, event1 is true.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Therefore no state after the initial state can have any event (in particular event2 never happens after the initial state).
- Consequently event2 never happens (there is no moment after the initial one where it can occur).

2) Evaluate the Ci at the initial state:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" — false (event1 happened initially).
- C2: same — false.
- C3: ""If C1 then C2"" — true (implication with a false antecedent).
- C4: ""C3 holds and event2 happens"" — false (event2 does not happen).
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" — false (C4 is false in every state, so certainly false in the next state).
- C6: ""Event1 does not happen"" — false at the initial state (same as C1).

3) C7 is the implication ""If C5 holds, then C6 holds"". At the initial state C5 is false, so the implication C7 is true (a false antecedent makes the implication true).

Therefore C7 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify givens:
- Initially event1 happened (so ""event1 does not happen"" is false in the initial state).
- After event1 no other events can happen, so there is no state after the initial one in which another event can occur; in particular event2 cannot happen after event1.

Step 2 — evaluate conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" False (contradicted by the initial event1).
- C2: same as C1, False.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" This is an implication A→A, which is always true (and also true here because C1 is false).
- C4: ""C3 holds and event2 happens."" Requires event2, but event2 cannot happen after event1, so C4 is False.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" With no next state or with C4 false now, C5 is False.
- C6: ""Event1 does not happen."" Same as C1, False.
- C7: ""If C5 holds, then C6 holds."" This implication has a false antecedent (C5 is false), so the implication is true.

Answer: True

Brief reasoning (summary):
- From the context, event1 happened initially and no events can occur after event1, so event2 does not happen.
- Thus C1 and C2 (""Event2 does not happen"") are true.
- C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is false.
- C4 (""C1 holds or C3 holds"") is true (because C1 is true).
- C5 (""C2 does not hold"") is false.
- C6 (""C4 holds or C5 holds"") is therefore true (since C4 is true).

Sample responses:
The hypothesis asks whether C7 (""C6 does not hold"") is true.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- From the context: event1 happened initially, and after event1 no other events can happen. Therefore event2 never occurs (there is no opportunity for it after the initial event1, and nothing indicates it occurred earlier).
- C1 (event1 and event2 happen) is false (event2 does not happen).
- C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false because C1 never becomes true.
- C3 is the same as C1, so false.
- C4 (C2 and C3) is false.
- C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is false.
- C6 (""C5 always holds"") is false.
- Therefore C7 (""C6 does not hold"") is true.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Context: initially event1 has occurred, and once event1 has occurred no further events can occur. Also, if event2 ever occurs then event1 must occur afterwards.
- Because event1 already happened initially and no events can occur after event1, event2 can never occur at any later time.
- C1 (""event1 happens and event2 happens"") therefore is false (event2 never happens).
- C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false, since C1 never becomes true.
- C3 is identical to C1, so false.
- C4 (C2 and C3) is false.
- C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is false.
- C6 (""C5 always holds"") is false.
- C7 (""C6 does not hold"") is true, because C6 is false.

Thus C7 is True.

Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Context: initially event1 happened. Also ""after event1, no other events can happen"" — so once that initial event1 has occurred, no event2 (or any other event) can ever occur later. (Simultaneous occurrence of event2 at the initial moment is disallowed because the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" would then require an event1 after event2, which cannot happen after the initial event1.)
- Therefore event2 never happens in any valid trace.
- C1 (""event1 happens and event2 happens"") is false (event2 does not happen).
- C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.
- C3 is the same as C1, so false. C4 (C2 and C3) is false. C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is false. C6 (""C5 always holds"") is false.
- C7 states ""C6 does not hold."" Since C6 is false, C7 is true."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 holds.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" means whenever event2 occurs, event1 will occur at some future time.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant to the truth of the logical formulas below because those formulas are tautological as shown next.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1: (event1 → event1). This is a propositional tautology, so C1 holds in every state.
- C2: C1 ∧ event1. Since C1 is always true, C2 is equivalent to event1.
- C3: C1 ∧ event1. Same as C2, so C3 is equivalent to event1.
- C4: (C2 → C3). Since C2 and C3 are the same formula, C4 is (P → P), a tautology, so C4 holds in every state.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" (next C4). Because C4 holds in every state, next C4 holds in any state that has a next state.
- C6: ""Eventually C5 holds."" Since C5 already holds at states with a next state (in particular it will hold at the initial state if a next state exists), C6 is satisfied.

Step 3 — conclusion
All necessary formulas reduce to tautologies or hold at some future state, so C6 is True.

True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C6 says “C5 eventually holds.” We must decide whether that is true given the context.

Step 2 — simplify the conditions
- C1: (event1 → event1) — a tautology, so C1 holds in every state.
- C2 and C3: both are (C1 ∧ event1). Since C1 always holds, C2 and C3 are true exactly in the states where event1 holds.
- C4: (C2 → C3). Because C2 and C3 are identical, C4 is always true in any state (it’s a trivial implication).

Step 3 — use the event constraints to find when these hold
- Initially event2 occurred. By “after event2, event1 must happen,” event1 will occur in the next state.
- In that next state (where event1 holds): C2 and C3 are true, so C4 is true in that state.
- C5 is “C4 holds in the next state.” At the initial state, the next state is the one where event1 holds and we just saw C4 is true there, so C5 is true in the initial state.
- C6 is “C5 eventually holds.” Since C5 already holds in the initial state, C6 is true (eventuality satisfied immediately).

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
We must decide whether C6 (""C5 eventually holds"") is True or False given the initial situation and the C1–C5 statements.

Step 2 — the timeline from the context
- S0 (initial): event2 happened.
- The context says: after event2, event1 must happen → there is a next state S1 where event1 happens.
- After event1, no other events can happen → S1 has event1 and no further events after it (it can still be a well-defined state).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology; C1 holds in any state.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" This is true exactly in states where event1 happens (and C1 holds). In particular, C2 is true in S1 (since event1 happens there and C1 holds).
- C3: identical to C2, so it also holds in the same states (S1).
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" Since C2 and C3 are the same, C4 is true in any state where it is evaluated (in particular in S1).
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" Consider S0: its next state is S1, and we just saw C4 holds in S1, so C5 is true in S0.
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" Since C5 already holds in S0, it holds eventually (holding now implies holding eventually).

C6 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C5 (which is ""C3 holds and C4 holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event2 happened. 
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
So event2 does happen (at least initially), and the rules force event1 and event2 to alternate thereafter.

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: Event2 does not happen. (This is false in the given context, since event2 did happen initially.)
- C2: Event2 does not happen. (Same as C1.)
- C3: If C1 holds, then C2 holds. This is the implication P → P (with P = ""Event2 does not happen""), which is always true (a proposition implies itself).
- C4: Same as C3, also always true.
- C5: C3 holds and C4 holds — the conjunction of two true statements.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C3 is true and C4 is true, so C5 is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" (C1 → C2)
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" (same as C3)
- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" (C3 ∧ C4)

Step 2 — use the context
- The context states that event2 happened (initially), so the proposition ""Event2 does not happen"" is false. Therefore C1 is false and C2 is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C3 and C4
- C3 is the implication C1 → C2. In classical logic, an implication with a false antecedent is true. Since C1 is false, C3 is true.
- Likewise C4 is the same implication, so C4 is also true.

Step 4 — evaluate C5
- C5 is C3 ∧ C4. Both C3 and C4 are true, so C5 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- From the context, event2 did happen, so the proposition ""Event2 does not happen"" (C1 and C2) is false.
- C3 and C4 are both the implication ""if C1 then C2"". Since C1 and C2 are the same proposition, each is of the form P → P, which is always true in classical logic. (Also, with P false, P → P is true.)
- Therefore C3 is true and C4 is true, so C5 (C3 and C4) is true."

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C7 holds.

From the context:
- Event2 has already happened initially.
- After event2 no other events can happen, so event1 does not (and cannot) happen now or later.

Evaluate the conditions:
- C1 (""event1 happens and event1 happens"") is false (event1 never happens).
- C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.
- C3 (same as C1) is false.
- C4 (C2 and C3) is false (true AND false → false).
- C5 (""eventually C4"") is false because C4 will never become true.
- C6 (C5 or event2 happens) is true because event2 already happened.
- C7 (""eventually C6"") is true, since C6 holds now (so it holds at some time ≥ now).

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 has happened.
- After event2 no other events can happen, so no event can occur now or later (including event1).
- The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant because event1 cannot occur (there is already an event2 and nothing can happen after it).

Step 2 — evaluate conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — impossible (event1 cannot occur). So C1 = False.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — True (since C1 is False).
- C3: same as C1 — False.
- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds"" — False (C3 is False).
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" — False (C4 is permanently False).
- C6: ""C5 holds or event2 happens"" — True, because event2 has happened initially.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds"" — True, because C6 is already true now (so it holds eventually).

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning, step by step:

- C1 and C3 are the same: ""Event1 happens.""  
- From the context: event2 happens initially, and after event2 no other events can happen → event1 never occurs. So C1 and C3 are false.
- C2 = not C1 → true.
- C4 = C2 and C3 → true and false → false.
- C5 = ""eventually C4"" → false, because C4 never becomes true (no further events can occur after the initial event2).
- C6 = C5 or event2 happens → false or true → true, because event2 did happen initially.
- C7 = ""eventually C6"" → true, since C6 already holds at the initial moment (so there is a time — the initial time — at which C6 is true).

Therefore C7 is True."

- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Both parts true → C2 is True.

- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" Both are true → C6 is True.

Final answer:

Step 1 — interpret context
- Initially event1 happened. So ""Event1 happens"" is true (it has occurred).
- After event1, event2 must happen; then after event2 no further events can happen. That only adds that event2 will occur later and nothing else after, which does not contradict anything about event1.

Identify the hypothesis: we must decide whether C6 is True or False.

Examine the context and each condition:
- Context: Initially event1 happened. After event1, no other events can happen. Therefore no event (including event2) can occur after the initial event1.
- From that, C1 (""Event2 does not happen."") is true.
- C2 (""C1 eventually holds."") — since C1 is already true (and remains true), C1 certainly holds at some time (immediately), so C2 is true.
- C3 is the same as C2, so C3 is true.
- C4 (""C2 holds and C3 holds."") is true (both conjuncts true).
- C5 (""C4 does not hold."") is false.
- C6 (""C5 does not hold."") is the negation of C5, so C6 is true.

Final answer:

---
Identify the question
- We must determine whether C6 (""C5 does not hold"") is true or false given the context and the other conditions.

Understand the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen → no event (including event2) can occur after the initial event1.
- After event2, event1 must happen. (This is irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur.)

Examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Given the context (event1 happened initially and no other events can happen afterward), event2 never happens. So C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" C1 is already true, so C1 holds now and therefore eventually holds. So C2 is true.
- C3: identical to C2, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds."" Both are true, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is true, C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" C5 is false, so ""C5 does not hold"" is true. Note logically C6 ≡ C4, and we already have C4 true.

Conclusion
- C6 is True.
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 occurred.
- After event1 no other events can happen (so event1 is terminal).
- If event2 happens then event1 must happen afterwards. But since event1 already happened initially and is terminal, no event (including event2) can occur after that initial event1. Therefore event2 cannot occur at any time.

Step 2 — evaluate conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" True (event2 cannot occur).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" True — C1 holds immediately, so it holds eventually.
- C3: same as C2, True.
- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds."" True (both true).
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" False (C4 does hold).
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" True (since C5 is false).

Step 1 — identify the question
- We must evaluate whether C6 (""If C2 holds, then C5 holds"") is true or false given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — use the context to evaluate the Ci
- Context: event1 happened (initially). Therefore ""Event1 does not happen"" is false.
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" → False.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C1 always holds."" Same as C2 → False.
- C4: ""Event1 does not happen."" Same as C1 → False.
- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" Both conjuncts are false → C5 is False.

Step 3 — evaluate C6
- C6 is the implication (C2 → C5). In classical logic an implication is true whenever the antecedent is false. Here C2 is false, so the implication is vacuously true regardless of C5.

Final answer
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- C6 is the statement ""If C2 holds, then C5 holds"" (i.e., C2 → C5). We must decide if that implication is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — evaluate C1–C5 from the context
- Context: event1 happened (initially). So ""Event1 does not happen"" is false.
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" → false.
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" → false (since C1 is false).
- C3: ""C1 always holds"" → false (same as C2).
- C4: ""Event1 does not happen"" → false (same as C1).
- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds"" → false ∧ false = false.

Step 3 — evaluate C6 (C2 → C5)
- An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously). Here C2 is false, so C2 → C5 is true regardless of C5's value.

Final answer
True

We ask whether C6 (""If C2 holds, then C5 holds"") is true given the context.

Step-by-step:
- Context says event1 happened initially, so the statement C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is false.
- Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false, and likewise C3 is false. C4 is the same as C1, so false.
- C5 (""C3 holds and C4 holds"") is false (both conjuncts are false).
- C6 is the implication C2 → C5. An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously). In every model consistent with the context, C2 is false, so C2 → C5 holds.

Sample responses:
Goal: determine truth of C7 given the context.

Context summary
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
Thus the only actual event that happened is event2; event1 does not happen at any point.

Interpret the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" ≡ Event1 happens. So C1 is false (event1 does not occur).
- C2: same as C1, so false.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" There are no further states beyond the initial one, and C3 is true in the current (and only) state, so C4 is true.
- C5: same as C1, so false.
- C6: ""If event1 happens, then C5 holds."" Antecedent false, so the implication is true; C6 is true.
- C7: ""C4 holds or C6 holds."" Both C4 and C6 are true, so their disjunction C7 is true.

Conclusion
C7 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- We must determine the truth of C7, given the context and the listed conditions C1–C6.

Step 2 — simplify the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" simplifies to Event1 (call it p).
- C2: same as C1 — simplifies to p.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"" becomes (p → p), which is a tautology (always true).
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — since C3 is the tautology (p → p), it holds at every time, so C4 is true.
- C5: again ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" simplifies to p.
- C6: ""If event1 happens, then C5 holds"" becomes (p → p), also a tautology, so C6 is true.
- C7: ""C4 holds or C6 holds"" is (C4 ∨ C6).

Step 3 — use the context about events:
- Context says initially event2 happened and after event2 no other events can happen, so in fact event1 does not occur (p is false). That doesn't matter for the tautologies above: both (p → p) statements are true even if p is false (they are vacuously/structurally true).

Step 4 — conclude C7:
- C4 is true (C3 is always true), and C6 is true (p → p). Therefore C4 ∨ C6 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify goal
We must decide whether C7 (C4 holds or C6 holds) is true given the context.

Step 2 — use the context
Initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. So event1 does not happen.

Step 3 — evaluate each condition with event1 = false
- C1 = ""event1 happens or event1 happens"" ≡ event1 → false.
- C2 = same as C1 → false.
- C3 = C1 → C2 = false → false = True (a material implication with false antecedent is true).
- C4 = ""C3 always holds"" — C3 is true, so C4 is True.
- C5 = same as C1 → false.
- C6 = event1 → C5 = false → false = True.
- C7 = C4 ∨ C6 = True ∨ True = True.

Answer: True

Reasoning, step by step:

- Expand the definitions:
  - C1 and C4 are the same: ""Event1 always happens.""
  - C2 = ""Event2 happens and C1 holds.""
  - C3 = ""C2 holds and event2 happens"" = (event2 and C1) and event2 = event2 and C1 (redundant event2).
  - C5 = ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds"" = (C3 ⇒ C1).

- Observe that C3 contains C1 as a conjunct (C3 = C1 ∧ event2). Therefore C3 ⇒ C1 is a logical tautology: whenever C3 is true, C1 must be true. So C5 is true in every state (it does not depend on the context).

- Since C5 is true in every state, ""C5 holds in the next state"" (C6) is true now. Consequently, ""C6 eventually holds"" (C7) is also true (it already holds).

Thus C7 is True.
---
We are asked whether C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is true given the event rules:
- s0 (initial): event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so s1: event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so s2: event1), and so on (events alternate e1, e2, e1, ...).

Evaluate the Ci's along this infinite trace:

- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" (globally). This is false, since s1, s3, ... are event2 states where event1 does not hold.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds"" = (event2 ∧ C1). False everywhere: at event2 states event2 is true but C1 is false; at event1 states event2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens"" = (C2 ∧ event2). False everywhere (C2 is false).
- C4: same as C1, false.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds"" = (C3 → C4). An implication with false antecedent is true, and since C3 is false at every state, C5 is true at every state.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state"" = X C5. Because C5 is true at every state, X C5 is true at every state as well, so C6 is true at every state.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds"" = F C6. Since C6 already holds now (indeed at every state), C7 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context the events alternate starting with event1 at time 0: event1 at times 0,2,4,... and event2 at times 1,3,5,...

2. Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Interpreting ""always"" as globally true at every state — this is false (event1 does not occur at the odd states).
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" Requires C1, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" Since C2 is false, C3 is false.
- C4: Same as C1, so false.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C5 is true (in every state).
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" Because C5 holds in every state, C6 is true (at every state).
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" Since C6 already holds (immediately), C7 is satisfied.

Therefore C7 is True."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — understand the hypothesis items
- C1, C3, C4 are all the same form: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" These are logical tautologies (p → p), so each of C1, C3, C4 is true.
- C2 is ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" Since C1 is true, C2 is true (true OR anything = true).
- C5 is ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" Both C3 and C4 are true, so C5 is true.
- C6 is ""If event1 happens, then C5 holds."" C5 is already true unconditionally, so the implication is true (an implication with a true consequent is true).
- C7 is ""C2 holds or C6 holds."" Both C2 and C6 are true, so C7 is true.

Step 2 — final determination
- C7 is True.
---
Step 1 — question: C7 is asking whether ""C2 holds or C6 holds"" is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — examine each condition:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is P → P, a tautology, so C1 is True.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" Since C1 is True, C2 is True regardless of event2.
- C3 and C4: both are the same P → P tautology, so each is True.
- C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" Since both C3 and C4 are True, C5 is True.
- C6: ""If event1 happens, then C5 holds."" C5 is True unconditionally, so the implication is True; C6 is True.

Step 3 — conclude C7:
- C7 is ""C2 holds or C6 holds."" Both C2 and C6 are True, so C7 is True.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C7 is true or false given the context and the listed conditions.

Step 2 — useful logical facts and context
- In propositional logic, an implication A → A is always true (a tautology).
- An OR expression P ∨ Q is true if at least one of P or Q is true.
- The context states event1 happens initially and the rules imply event2 will follow (and then event1 again), but that extra detail isn’t needed for the tautologies below.

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is A → A, therefore true.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" C1 is true, so C2 is true (true ∨ anything = true).
- C3: same as C1, so true.
- C4: same as C1, so true.
- C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" Both C3 and C4 are true, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""If event1 happens, then C5 holds."" Since C5 is true, the implication is true regardless of the antecedent, so C6 is true.
- C7: ""C2 holds or C6 holds."" Both C2 and C6 are true, so C7 is true.

Answer being asked: is C7 true or false?

Step-by-step:

- Context implies an infinite alternating sequence: event2 (initially), then event1, then event2, then event1, ... So event2 occurs now and infinitely often.

- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — equivalent to ""event2 happens"". True (event2 holds initially).

- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — since C1 is true now (and event2 recurs), eventually C1 holds. True.

- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — this says ""at every point in time, eventually C1 holds"" (i.e., event2 occurs infinitely often). True, because event2 repeats forever.

- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" — false, because C3 is true.

- C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" — false, since C4 never becomes true.

- C6: ""C5 does not hold"" — true, because C5 is false.

- C7: ""C6 always holds"" — true, because C5 never holds so C6 is true at every time.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initial event2 occurs.
- After any event2, event1 must occur (so event1 follows each event2).
- After any event1, event2 must occur (so event2 follows each event1).
Thus the system forces an infinite alternation: event2, event1, event2, event1, ... so event2 occurs infinitely often (from every point in the trace, eventually event2 will occur). In temporal logic this is G F event2.

Step 2 — interpret and simplify the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" ≡ ""event2 happens"".
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" ≡ F(event2) (eventually event2).
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" ≡ G F(event2).
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" ≡ ¬(G F(event2)).
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" ≡ F(¬(G F(event2))).
- C6: ""C5 does not hold"" ≡ ¬F(¬(G F(event2))) ≡ G(G F(event2)) ≡ G F(event2).
- C7: ""C6 always holds"" ≡ G(C6) ≡ G(G F(event2)) ≡ G F(event2).

Step 3 — evaluate truth values under the context
- Because the system forces infinite alternation, G F(event2) is true.
- Therefore C6 is true and C7 (which is equivalent to G F(event2)) is true.

Final answer:

---
You ask whether C7 is True or False.

Step 1 — clarify the setting and temporal semantics
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
Thus once event2 has occurred (and it has, initially), no further events can occur, so the system stays in that state forever.
Interpret ""always"" as true in all future states (including the current one) and ""eventually"" as true in some future state (including the current one).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" True, because event2 happened initially and after event2 no other events (including event1) can happen.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" False, since C1 holds.
- C3: ""Event1 does not happen."" Same as C1, so True.
- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds."" False (C2 is false, C3 true).
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" True, because C4 is false.
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" True: there are no future events that can change truth values, so C5 remains true in all future states.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" True, because C6 already holds now (so it holds at some future time).

Final answer:
True

We are asked whether C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is true given the context.

Step-by-step:
- Context: Initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. Thus event1 never happens.
- C1 (Event1 does not happen): true.
- C2 (C1 does not hold): false (negation of a true statement).
- C3 (Event1 does not happen): true (same as C1).
- C4 (C2 holds and C3 holds): false (C2 is false).
- C5 (C4 does not hold): true (negation of false).
- C6 (C5 always holds): true, because nothing can change after the initial event2, so C5 remains true at all times.

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

- C7 is the statement ""If C5 holds, then C6 holds"" (C5 ⇒ C6).
- Unpack the definitions:
  - C1 = ""event2 happens in the next state"".
  - C2 = same as C1.
  - C3 = ""C2 holds in the next state"" = event2 in two steps.
  - C4 = C1 ∧ C3, so C4 includes C1.
  - C5 = C4 ∧ event1, so C5 also includes C1.
  - C6 = ""event2 happens in the next state"" = C1.
- Since C5 includes C1 and C6 ≡ C1, C5 ⇒ C6 holds by simple propositional reasoning (if C5 is true then C1 is true, i.e. C6 is true).
- The context (""after event1 no other events can happen"") actually makes C5 impossible, but that only makes the implication vacuously true in any case.

Therefore C7 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C7 is the formula ""If C5 holds, then C6 holds."" We must determine whether that implication is true given the context and the definitions of C1–C6.

Step 2 — meaning of the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so any occurrence of event2 is followed by an occurrence of event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen (once event1 occurs, there are no subsequent events).

Step 3 — unpack the conditions
- C1/C2/C6: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the next state, event2 happens in that next state's next state (so event2 two steps ahead).
- C4: C1 and C3 — requires event2 in the next state and event2 in the state after that.
- C5: C4 and event1 happens — requires event1 now, plus event2 in the next and the next-next states.

Step 4 — reason about satisfiability
- C5 requires: event1 now and event2 later (in the next and next-next states).
- But the context explicitly forbids any events after an occurrence of event1 (""after event1, no other events can happen""). Therefore if event1 holds at the time C5 is claimed, no later event2 can occur. So C5 cannot be true in any model consistent with the context (it is unsatisfiable).

Step 5 — truth of the implication
- An implication ""If C5 then C6"" is true whenever C5 is false (vacuous truth). Since C5 cannot hold under the given context, the implication C7 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
C7 is the conditional ""If C5 holds, then C6 holds."" We must decide whether that implication is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the Ci formulas (using X = ""in the next state"")
- C1: X(event2) — event2 happens in the next state.
- C2: X(event2) — same as C1.
- C3: X(C2) = X(X(event2)) — event2 happens in the state after next.
- C4: C1 ∧ C3 = X(event2) ∧ X X(event2).
- C5: C4 ∧ event1 = event1 ∧ X(event2) ∧ X X(event2).
- C6: X(event2) — same as C1.
- C7: C5 ⇒ C6.

Step 3 — use the context
Context says: initially event1 happened (so event1 holds now), and ""after event1, no other events can happen."" That means if event1 holds now, then in the next state no events (in particular event2) occur, so X(event2) is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C5 and C6 at the initial state
- Because event1 now holds, but after event1 no events can happen, X(event2) is false. Therefore C1 (and C2) are false, so C4 and hence C5 are false.
- C6 (X(event2)) is false as well.

Step 5 — truth of the implication C7
An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously). Since C5 is false in the given context, C5 ⇒ C6 is true.

Step 1 — what is asked:
- Decide whether C6 is True or False given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — interpret the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen → once event1 has happened, event2 cannot occur.
- After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant because event2 cannot occur after the initial event1).

Step 3 — evaluate each condition:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Given the context, this is true.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is true, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" C2 is false, so C3 is false.

- C5: ""C1 does not hold."" Same as C2, this is false.
- C6: ""C4 holds or C5 holds."" That is True OR False → True.

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 occurs at the start).
- After event1, no other events can happen (once event1 has occurred, no further events can occur).
- After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 occurs then event1 must occur afterwards).

Because event1 already happened initially and no events can occur after event1, event2 cannot occur at any time. (There is no time before the initial moment for event2, and it cannot occur after event1.)

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" True (we just concluded event2 cannot occur).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" False (negation of C1).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" False (C2 is false, so it cannot always hold).
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" True (negation of C3).
- C5: ""C1 does not hold."" False (negation of C1).
- C6: ""C4 holds or C5 holds."" True or False = True (since C4 is true).

Final answer:
True

Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1, no other events can happen → since event1 already happened initially, no events (including event2) can ever occur afterward.
- The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never occurs.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" — True (event2 cannot occur).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" — False (negation of C1).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" — False (C2 is false).

Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C6 (""C5 eventually holds"") is True or False given the context and the other C-conditions.

Step 2 — use the context about events
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So event1 never occurs (it did not happen before the initial event2 and cannot happen afterwards).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Because event2 does happen but event1 does not, C1 is false (there is a counterexample).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" C1 is false, so the implication C2 is vacuously true.
- C3: same as C2, so C3 is also vacuously true.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" C3 holds, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C2 holds or C4 holds."" Both C2 and C4 hold, so C5 is true now.
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" Since C5 already holds immediately, C6 is true.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context: event2 happened initially, and no events can happen after event2. There is no information that event1 happens at any time, so take event1 as not occurring.

- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Since event2 does happen but event1 does not, C1 is false.

- C2 and C3: Each is ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Because C1 is false, the antecedent is false, so these implications are true (a material implication with a false antecedent is true).

- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" C3 holds (true), so C4 is true.

- C5: ""C2 holds or C4 holds."" Both C2 and C4 are true, so C5 is true.

- C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" C5 holds already (immediately), so ""eventually"" is satisfied. Therefore C6 is true."

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. What is being asked
- C7 asserts ""C6 always holds."" We must determine whether C7 is true given the context.

2. Context summary
- Initially, event1 happened (so in the initial state event1 is true).
- After event1, no other events can happen (the execution terminates after the initial state).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 would also be terminal if it ever occurs).

3. Evaluate the conditions in order
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" This is false in the initial state because the initial state has event1 (not event2), and no transitions allow event2 to occur later.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" C1 is false but event1 does hold initially, so C2 is true in the initial state.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" There is no next state (execution terminates after event1), so the next-state requirement is false (standard temporal semantics: X φ is false if there is no next state). Hence C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 holds and event1 happens."" C3 is false, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" Again no next state, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" Since C5 is false now and there are no future states where it could become true, C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" C6 is false in the initial state, so C7 is false.

4. Conclusion
- C7 is False.
---
Short summary of facts:
- Initially event1 occurs, and after event1 no further events can occur. Therefore event2 never occurs.

Evaluation (brief):
- C1 (""event2 always happens"") is false.
- C2 (""C1 or event1"") is true initially (because event1 occurred) but C2 does not hold in the next state.
- That makes C3 false, hence C4 false, C5 false, C6 false, and therefore C7 (""C6 always holds"") is false.

Sample responses:
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Setup: let e1 mean ""event1 happens at the current state"" and e2 mean ""event2 happens at the current state"". The trace consistent with the context is:
   - s0: e2 true, e1 false (event2 happened initially),
   - s1, s2, ...: both e1 and e2 false (after either event no further events occur).

2. C1 = (e1 or e2). So C1 is true at s0 and false at s1+.

3. C2 = (e1 -> C1). This is a propositional tautology: e1 -> (e1 or e2) is always true in every state (if e1 is false implication holds; if e1 is true the consequent holds). So C2 is true at every state.

4. C3 = ""C2 always holds"" = G(C2). Since C2 holds at every state, C3 is true.

5. C4 = ""C3 holds in the next state"" = X(C3). Because C3 is true at every state, X(C3) is true at s0 (indeed at every state).

6. C5 = ""C4 eventually holds"" = F(X(C3)). X(C3) holds at every state, so F(X(C3)) holds at every state; in particular it holds at s0.

7. C6 = ""C5 always holds"" = G(F(X(C3))). Since F(X(C3)) holds at every state, C6 is true at every state.

8. C7 = ""C6 holds in the next state"" = X(C6). Because C6 is true at every state, X(C6) is true at s0.

Therefore C7 is True.

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context: ""Initially, event1 happened"" and ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Since event1 already happened initially, no further events can ever happen. Therefore event2 does not happen. So C1 (Event2 does not happen) is True.

2. C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" — the negation of C1. Since C1 is True, C2 is False.

3. C3 is ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" The antecedent (event2 happens) is false in the actual course of events, so the implication is vacuously True. Hence C3 holds.

4. C4 is ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 already holds, so C4 is True.

5. C5 is ""If event2 happens, then C4 holds."" Again the antecedent is false, so the implication is vacuously True. Thus C5 holds.

6. C6 is ""C5 does not hold"" — the negation of C5. Since C5 is True, C6 is False.

7. C7 is ""C6 does not hold"" — the negation of C6. Since C6 is False, C7 is True.

Therefore C7 is True.
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen → once event1 has happened (and it has, initially), event2 can never happen.
- Therefore event2 does not happen (at any time).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" — True (from above).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" — False (contradicts C1).
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" — True (implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true, and event2 never happens).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" — True (C3 already holds).
- C5: ""If event2 happens, then C4 holds."" — True (vacuously true because event2 does not happen).
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" — False (C5 holds).
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" — True (because C6 is false).

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context: event1 happens initially, and after event1 no other events can happen. Therefore event2 cannot occur at any time. So C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is true.

2. C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., event2 does happen). Since C1 is true, C2 is false.

3. C3 is ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" That is an implication whose antecedent (event2 happens) is false in the actual situation, so the implication is true.

4. C4 is ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 already holds, so C4 holds as well.

5. C5 is ""If event2 happens, then C4 holds."" Its antecedent is false, so the implication is true.

6. C6 is ""C5 does not hold."" Since C5 holds, C6 is false.

Identify the question
- C7 is ""C6 always holds"" (i.e., G(C6)). We must decide if C7 is True or False given the context.

Translate the context into a timeline
- At time 0 (initial): event2 has happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → at time 1, event1 happens.
- After event1, no other events can happen → from time 2 onward, no events occur.

Evaluate the conditions along the trace (times 0, 1, 2,...)
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" At time 0 this is true (event2 already happened at time 0). At times ≥1 it is false (event2 will not happen again).
- C2: same as C1 (redundant).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" = F(C2). At time 0 this is true because C2 holds now (k = 0). At times ≥1 it is false because C2 never holds again in the future.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" = ¬C3. So C4 is false at time 0 and true at times ≥1.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" = X C4. At time 0 this means C4 holds at time 1 (which is true). At times ≥1 it means C4 holds at the next time (for time 1, C4 at time 2 is true because from time 1 onward C3 is false so C4 true), so C5 holds whenever needed below.
- C6: ""If C1 holds, then C5 holds"" = (C1 → C5).
  - At time 0: C1 is true and C5 is true, so C6 is true.
  - At times ≥1: C1 is false, so C6 is vacuously true.
- C7: ""C6 always holds"" = G(C6). Since C6 is true at every time point along the trace, C7 is true.

1. From the context: event1 happens initially, and after event1 no other events can happen. Therefore event2 never happens at any future state.

2. C1 and C2 (""event2 eventually happens"") are both false.

3. C3 = C1 and C2 is false (false and false = false).

4. C4 (""if C3 holds then event2 happens"") is vacuously true because its antecedent C3 is false.

5. C5 (""if event2 happens then C4 holds"") is also vacuously true, because event2 never happens (so the implication has a false antecedent everywhere).

6. C6 (""C5 holds in the next state"") is true, since C5 holds in all states including the next one.

7. C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is true, because C6 already holds now (so it holds at some future time — immediately).

Therefore C7 is True.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Context: Initially event1 has happened. After event1 no other events can happen, so event2 can never occur at any time (there is no future point at which event2 happens).

- C1 and C2 (""Event2 eventually happens""): both are false because event2 never happens.

- C3 (C1 and C2): false (conjunction of two false statements).

- C4 (If C3 then event2 happens): true vacuously, because its antecedent C3 is false.

- C5 (If event2 happens then C4 holds): true vacuously, because event2 never happens (antecedent false).

- C6 (C5 holds in the next state): there is no next state after the initial one (no further events can occur), so ""in the next state"" is not true — C6 is false.

- C7 (C6 eventually holds): false, because C6 is false now and there are no future states in which it could become true.

Therefore C7 is False."

True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. So event2 occurs at the initial moment but does not (and cannot) occur at later states.
- C1 (""event2 always happens"") is false because ""always"" would require event2 at every state, but in the next states no events occur (so event2 does not hold there).
- C2 and C5 (""C1 holds in the next state"") are false for the same reason.
- C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false because C2 is false.
- C4 (""If C3 holds, then event2 happens"") is a material implication whose antecedent C3 is false; a false antecedent makes the implication true (vacuously true).
- Therefore C4 is true, C5 is false, and C6 = C4 ∨ C5 is true.
---
Reasoning:

- From the context, event2 happens initially, and after event2 no further events can occur. So there is a (next) state in which event2 does not occur.
- C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false: event2 does not occur in that subsequent state, so it is not true at all times.
- C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false because C1 is false in that next state.
- C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false because C2 is false now (so it cannot hold at all times).
- C4 (""If C3 holds, then event2 happens"") is true vacuously, since its antecedent C3 is false.
- C5 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false (same as C2).
- Therefore C6 (C4 or C5) is true because C4 is true.

Final answer:
True

Plan: interpret temporal operators in the usual way (G = always, X = next; Xφ is false at a state with no successor). Use the facts:
- Initially event2 happened (event2 is true at the initial state).
- After event2, no other events can happen → the initial state is terminal (there is no next state).

Evaluate the conditions:

- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" (G event2). This requires event2 to hold at every state. It holds at the initial state but there are no further states to require it at; however ""always"" quantifies over all states of the (single) path, so C1 would be true only if event2 holds at every reachable state. Since the only state is the initial one and event2 does hold there, one might think C1 is true — but usually ""always"" is a property over time: we need to check every state and we do have event2 at the only state, so C1 is true. (Alternatively, if one reads ""always"" as ""at every time point including non-existent future times"", the standard interpretation is that with a single terminal state Gφ is true iff φ holds at that state. So C1 is true.)
  [Note: This detail doesn't affect the final result because of implication reasoning below.]

- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (X C1). There is no next state (initial state is terminal), so X C1 is false.

- C3: ""C2 always holds"" (G C2). Since C2 is false at the initial state, C3 is false.

- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens"" (C3 → event2). An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C4 is true.

- C5: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — same as C2, false.

- C6: ""C4 holds or C5 holds"" — since C4 is true, the disjunction is true.

Therefore C6 is True.

Step 1 — what’s being asked
- We must decide whether C6 (""C5 eventually holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context (events)
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur at some later time).
- After event2, no other events can happen.
Conclusion: event2 does indeed happen (it is inevitable after the initial event1).

Step 3 — evaluate conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is false (because event2 will happen).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is true (and is a logical consequence of C1 being false), C3 is true.
- C4: same as C2, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" C3 is true and C4 is true, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" C5 already holds now, so it certainly holds at some time (hence eventually).

Final answer
True
---
Step 1 — identify the goal
- We must decide whether C6 (""C5 eventually holds"") is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — restate the relevant context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur at some point).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so event2 is terminal).

From the context we know: event2 does happen (so the proposition ""event2 does not happen"" is false).

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is false (context guarantees event2 happens).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" This implication has a false antecedent (C1 is false), so C2 is vacuously true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is true, C3 is true.
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Same as C2, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" C3 is true and C4 is true, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" C5 already holds, so it certainly eventually holds. Therefore C6 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — use the context:
- Initially event1 happened, and after event1 event2 must happen. Therefore event2 does happen.

Step 2 — evaluate conditions using E = ""event2 happens"":
- C1: ""event2 does not happen"" is false (negation of E).
- C2: ""(if C1 then event2)"" is (not E) -> E, which is logically equivalent to E. Since E is true, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — given C2 is true (event2 happens), C3 is satisfied.
- C4: same as C2, so true.
- C5: ""if C3 then C4"" is true because both C3 and C4 hold.
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds"" is true because C5 already holds now (hence holds eventually).

True

Summary reasoning (concise, non-sensitive):
- From the context the rules ""after event1, event2 must happen"" and ""after event2, event1 must happen"" are invariants, so C1 (event1 -> event2) holds.
- C2 = (C1 ∨ event1) therefore holds (since C1 is true).
- C3 (eventually C2) holds because C2 already holds now.
- C4 (always C3) holds because C2 holds at every state (C1 is invariant), so at every state C3 holds.
- C5 (C4 holds in the next state) follows from C4.
- At the initial state event2 happened, and C5 holds there, so C6 (C5 ∧ event2) holds.
- Hence C7 (eventually C6) is true (it already holds now).
---
True

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. From the context ""After event1, event2 must happen"" we infer C1 is true (whenever event1 occurs, event2 will occur afterwards — so the implication in C1 holds).

2. If C1 is true, then C2 = (C1 or event1) is true (true or anything is true). So C2 holds in every state.

3. If C2 holds now, then ""eventually C2"" (C3) holds now (an eventuality is satisfied immediately if it already holds).

4. Because C2 holds in every state, C3 holds in every state; thus C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true.

5. If C4 always holds, then C4 holds in the next state, so C5 is true in the current state.

6. We were given that initially event2 happened, so at the initial state event2 is true. Together with C5 true, C6 (C5 and event2) is true already at the initial state.

7. Since C6 is true now, ""eventually C6"" (C7) is true.

Therefore C7 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context:
- At t0: event1 happens.
- After any event1, event2 must happen (so next step is event2).
- After any event2, event1 must happen (so they alternate forever: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Given the context this implication is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" C1 holds, and event2 does happen (e.g., at t1), so C2 is true at the times when event2 occurs (not at times when event1 occurs).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" That would require C2 to be true at every time. But because events alternate, there are times (e.g., t0) when event2 does not happen, so C2 is not true at every time. Therefore C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" That would mean at some future time onward C3 is true (i.e., from that point C2 always holds). Because the system continues alternating, C2 can never hold at every future instant, so C3 never becomes true; C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is false, C5 is true.
- C6: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This is the same as C1, so C6 is true.
- C7: ""C5 holds or C6 holds."" Since C6 is true (and C5 is also true), the disjunction is true.

Final answer:
True
---
You ask whether C7 (""C5 holds or C6 holds"") is true given the context. Step-by-step:

- Context implies an infinite alternation starting with event1: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This matches ""after event1, event2 must happen"" — so C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" C1 holds and event2 does occur (right after the initial event1), so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" This would require event2 to hold at every moment; but event2 only holds at alternating moments, not always. So C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Since C3 never holds, C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" This is true (because C4 is false).
- C6: same as C1, so true.

Therefore at least one of C5 or C6 is true (in fact both are true), so C7 is True.

True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide the truth of C7, which is (C5) OR (C6).

Step 2 — translate the context into logical facts
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1, event2 must happen → whenever event1 occurs it is followed by event2 (so ""if event1 happens then event2 happens"" holds).
- After event2, event1 must happen → events alternate forever: event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → ...

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This follows directly from the context, so C1 is True.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" C1 holds, and because event1 happened initially the subsequent event2 does happen, so C2 is True (there is an occurrence of event2).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" That would require that at every moment C2 is true (in particular that event2 is always happening). But events alternate, so there are times when event1 holds and event2 does not hold; therefore C2 is not true at all times. So C3 is False.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Since C3 is never true (there is no point after which event2 holds continuously), C4 is False.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is False, C5 is True.
- C6: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This is the same as C1 and is True.

Step 4 — evaluate C7
- C7 = C5 OR C6. We found C5 is True (and C6 is also True). An OR with a True disjunct is True.

Step-by-step reasoning:

- From the context, event2 happened initially, so C1 (""Event2 eventually happens"") is true.
- Given the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"", and C1 true, event1 does happen; thus C2 (""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"") is true.
- C2 is a general consequence of the given rules and holds now; therefore C3 (""C2 always holds"") is satisfied (it holds at every time consistent with the rules).
- Since C3 holds now, C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true.
- C5 (""Event2 eventually happens"") is the same as C1, so it is true.
- C6 (""If C4 holds, then C5 holds"") is true because both antecedent and consequent hold.
- C7 is the disjunction ""Event1 happens or C6 holds"". C6 holds, so C7 is true.

Identify the question
- We must decide whether C7 (""Event1 happens or C6 holds"") is true given the context:
  - Initially event2 happened.
  - After event2, event1 must happen.
  - After event1, event2 must happen.
  (So events alternate forever: event2, event1, event2, …)

Examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True — event2 already happened initially (and recurs).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" True — given event2 occurs, the rule says event1 must happen afterward.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" True — the implication in C2 follows from the given rules at all times.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" True — if C3 is always true, it certainly holds at some time.
- C5: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True — same as C1.
- C6: ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds."" True — both C4 and C5 are true, so the implication is true.
- C7: ""Event1 happens or C6 holds."" True — event1 does happen (and C6 also holds), so the disjunction is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must determine whether C7 (""Event1 happens or C6 holds"") is true given the context and the conditions C1–C6.

Step 2 — evaluate conditions using the context
- Context: initially event2 happened, and whenever event2 happens then event1 must happen; whenever event1 happens then event2 must happen. So the run contains event2, then event1, then event2, etc. (both events occur, repeatedly).

- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True (it happened initially).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Since C1 holds and the context requires event1 after event2, event1 does happen. So C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" C2 is a global truth under the given rules, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" If C3 always holds, it certainly holds eventually, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Same as C1, true.
- C6: ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds."" C4 holds, and C5 holds, so C6 is true.

Step 3 — conclude about C7
- C7 is ""Event1 happens or C6 holds."" We already established event1 does happen (and C6 also holds), so the disjunction is true.

Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 has already happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen — so once event2 has occurred (here, initially), event1 cannot occur at any later point.
- The rule ""After event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event1 can never occur (event2 already happened and prevents further events).

Step 2 — check each condition
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" True, because event2 happened initially and prevents event1 ever occurring.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" True — since event1 never happens at any time, C1 is true in the next state as well.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" True — C2 holds now (hence eventually).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" True — C3 already holds, so it eventually holds.
- C5: ""Event2 happens or C4 holds."" True — event2 did happen initially (and C4 also holds).
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" True — at every state either event2 has occurred (making the disjunction true) or C4 holds (C4 is true), so C5 holds at all times.
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" True — since C6 is true at all states, it is true in the next state.

Final answer:
True
---
First: the question asks whether C7 (""C6 holds in the next state"") is true given the context and the chain of conditions C1–C6.

Reasoning through the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2 no other events can happen. So from the initial state onward, event1 never occurs in any future state.

Now evaluate the conditions step by step (truth values are at the initial state unless otherwise noted):

1. C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" True, because event1 never occurs (no events after initial event2).
2. C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" True, since in the next state event1 also does not happen.
3. C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" True — in fact C2 already holds now.
4. C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" True — C3 already holds now.
5. C5: ""Event2 happens or C4 holds."" True in the initial state because event2 happened; in later states event2 does not happen but C4 still holds, so C5 is true in every state.
6. C6: ""C5 always holds."" True, because as just noted C5 holds in every state.
7. C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" True, since C6 holds in every state (including the next one).

Therefore C7 is True. Final answer: True"

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 occurred.
- After event2 no further events can occur.
- Because event2 already occurred initially, event1 cannot occur later (no events can happen after event2), and event1 did not occur before the initial moment.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1, C2, C4 = ""Event2 always happens"" — these may or may not hold, but we don't need them to be true.
- C5 = (C4 holds) or (event2 happens). Since event2 did happen initially, C5 is true.
- C3 = (C1 holds) or (C2 holds) — likely false, but irrelevant because of the next step.
- C6 = C3 or C5. Because C5 is true, C6 is true.
- C7 = ""C6 eventually holds."" C6 already holds at the initial moment, so ""eventually C6"" is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
C7 is ""C6 eventually holds."" We must decide whether C7 is True or False given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 occurs at the start).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so the trace contains event2 and then nothing else).
- After event1, event2 must happen (irrelevant here because event1 cannot occur after event2).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: Event2 always happens. Given the system’s trace contains event2 (it happened initially), C1 is satisfied in this trace.
- C2: same as C1, so also satisfied.
- C3: C1 holds or C2 holds. Since C1 (and C2) holds, C3 is true.
- C4: same as C1, so true.
- C5: C4 holds or event2 happens. Both disjuncts are true here (event2 happens and C4 holds), so C5 is true.
- C6: C3 holds or C5 holds. Both C3 and C5 are true, so C6 is true.
- C7: C6 eventually holds. Since C6 already holds in the trace, it certainly holds at some (in fact at the initial) time — so ""eventually C6"" is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what's asked
- We must decide whether C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — facts from the context
- Initially, event2 happened (so there is at least one timepoint at which event2 is true).
- After that event2, no other events occur (so no new events later).
- The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event1 does not occur (no events after the initial event2).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions at the initial time
- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" — false (event2 only occurred initially, not at all times).
- C2: same as C1 — false.
- C3: C1 or C2 — false.
- C4: same as C1 — false.
- C5: ""C4 holds or event2 happens"" — true, because event2 does happen at the initial time.
- C6: C3 or C5 — true (because C5 is true).
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds"" — true, since C6 already holds at the initial time (so it holds at some time in the future).

Sample responses:
Step 1 — understand the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1 no other events can happen. So once the initial state (with event1) is reached, no further events (in particular event2) can ever occur afterwards.

Step 2 — evaluate the statements in order
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Since event2 never happens (event1 already occurred and prevents any further events), C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" C1 is false, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" C2 is false (and event2 never happens), so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 is false now and cannot become true later (no events can occur), so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" C4 is false, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" C5 is false, so C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" C6 is false, so C7 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — What is being asked
- We must decide whether C7 (""C6 does not hold"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — Interpret the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once the initial state with event1 has occurred, there are no successors where any event (including event2) can occur.
- Also: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" (This is irrelevant because event2 cannot be reached given the previous line.)

Step 3 — Evaluate the conditions in order
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" This is false, because after the initial event1 no further events (including event2) can occur.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" There is no next state after the initial state (or if one treats X-operator as requiring a successor, it is false). So C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" C2 is false and event2 does not happen, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Since C3 never holds (no future where C3 is true), C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" False (no next state / C4 is false).
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" False.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" Since C6 is false, C7 is true.

Step 4 — Conclusion
- C7 is True.
---
Goal: decide whether C7 (""C6 does not hold"") is True or False.

Given facts:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Immediate consequence: once event1 has occurred (which is true initially), no further events can ever occur. In particular event2 never happens in any reachable future.

Evaluate the conditions in order:
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" False, because event2 never happens (event1 already happened and blocks further events).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" False (C1 is false, and there is no way for it to become true later).
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" False, because event2 does not happen (and C2 is false).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" False, because C3 is false now and can never become true (event2 cannot occur).
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" False (C4 is false and cannot become true).
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" False (same reasoning).

Therefore C6 does not hold, so C7 (""C6 does not hold"") is True.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the context: event2 happened initially, and the rules ""after event2, event1 must happen"" and ""after event1, event2 must happen"" force both events to occur (in fact repeatedly). So ""Event1 happens and event2 happens"" is true. Thus C1, C2, and C3 are true.
- C4 is ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" Since C2 and C3 are the same true statement, C4 is true.
- C5 says ""C4 eventually holds."" Because C4 is true, C5 is true.
- C6 says ""C5 does not hold."" That contradicts the previous line, so C6 is false.
- C7 is ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds."" Here C1 is true and C6 is false, so the implication C1 → C6 is false.

Therefore C7 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From context: event2 happened initially. After event2, event1 must happen; after event1, event2 must happen. So the two events alternate and both occur (infinitely often).
- C1, C2, C3 (""Event1 happens and event2 happens"") are therefore true.
- C4 (""If C2 holds, then C3 holds"") is true (C2 and C3 are both true, and the implication holds).
- C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true (C4 already holds).
- C6 (""C5 does not hold"") is false (because C5 holds).
- C7 (""If C1 holds, then C6 holds"") is false because C1 is true while C6 is false, making the implication false.
---
C7 is False.

Reasoning step-by-step:
- The question asks whether C7 (""If C1 holds, then C6 holds"") is true.
- From the context: event2 happens initially; after event2, event1 must happen; after event1, event2 must happen. So both event1 and event2 do happen (they alternate). Therefore C1, C2, and C3 (""Event1 happens and event2 happens"") are true.
- C4 is ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" Since C2 and C3 are the same proposition, C4 is a tautology and thus true.
- C5 says ""C4 eventually holds."" Because C4 is already true, C5 is true.
- C6 is ""C5 does not hold,"" which is false because C5 is true.
- C7 is ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds."" C1 is true while C6 is false, so the implication is false.

True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Context: initially event1 occurred, and the rules say that after event1 no other events can happen (and similarly after event2 no other events can happen). Since event1 already happened initially, no events can occur in any later state.

- C1 = ""event2 happens in the next state."" That is false, because no events can occur after the initial event1.

- C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" is also false (C1 is false at the next state, and no events happen later either).

- Each subsequent Ci (C3, C4, C5) asserts some form of ""always"" or nesting of the previous false condition, so they are all false as well. In particular, C5 is false.

- C6 is the same as C1 (event2 in the next state) and is false.

- C7 is the implication ""If C5 holds, then C6 holds."" An implication is true whenever the antecedent is false. Since C5 is false in this context, the implication C7 is true (vacuously).

Therefore C7 is True.
---
We are asked whether C7 (the formula ""If C5 holds, then C6 holds"") is true or false, given the context.

Step-by-step reasoning

- Context: at time 0 (initial) event1 happened. The context also says that after event1, no other events can happen. So for every time t ≥ 1, no events occur. (Also ""after event2 no other events can happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 never occurs.)
- Evaluate C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" — at time 0 this asserts event2 at time 1. But by the context, no events occur at time 1, so C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — at time 0 this asserts that at time 1, C1 is true (i.e., event2 would happen at time 2). Since no events occur at time 2 either, C1 at time 1 is false, so C2 is false.
- C3, C4, C5: these are assertions that the previous condition ""always holds"" (nested); since C2 is false at least at time 0, the universally quantified/always statements C3–C5 are false.
- C6: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" is the same as C1 and is false.
- C7: ""If C5 holds, then C6 holds"" is an implication with a false antecedent (C5 is false). An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuous truth).

We are asked whether C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true given the context and the conditions.

1) Context summary
- Initially event1 has happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen → event2 cannot occur at any later time.
- (Also: after event2, event1 must happen — irrelevant because event2 cannot occur.)

2) Evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" False, because event2 is impossible after the initial event1.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" True (vacuously/tautologically true: if event2 happens then event2 eventually happens).
- C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" True (C2 holds).
- C4: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Same as C1 → False.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" Since C3 is true but C4 is false, C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" True (because C5 is false).
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" The situation is static (no further events can occur), so C6 remains true at all future times → C7 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — parse the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Since event1 happened initially, no events can ever occur after that.
- After event2, event1 must happen. (This only constrains runs where event2 occurs; it does not force event2 to occur.)

Conclusion from context: event2 never occurs.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" False (event2 never occurs).
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" True. As an implication, it is vacuously true when event2 does not occur; and if event2 did occur, it would imply ""event2 eventually happens,"" which is also true. So C2 is true.
- C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" Since C2 is true, C3 is true.
- C4: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Same as C1, so false.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" This is C3 -> C4. C3 is true and C4 is false, so the implication is false; therefore C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" Since C5 is false, C6 is true.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" Nothing in the run changes truth values (no further events), so C6 holds now and at all future times — C7 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — understand the context
- Initially event1 has happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So no further events (including event2) can occur after that initial event1.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" just says if event2 ever occurs, event1 must occur afterwards — but given event1 already happened initially and no events can occur after it, event2 cannot occur at any time.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" — False (event2 cannot happen under the context).
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" — True (if event2 happens then event2 eventually happens; the implication is true).
- C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" — True (C2 holds).
- C4: ""Event2 eventually happens."" — same as C1, False.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" — False (C3 is true but C4 is false, so the implication is false).
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" — True (because C5 is false).
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" — True: there are no further events or state changes after the initial state, and C6 is true in the actual state, so C6 holds at all times on the trace.

Step 1 — Understand the scenario
- Time 0: event2 happened (given).
- Rule: after event2, event1 must happen next; after event1, event2 must happen next.
- So the events alternate: e2 at even times (0,2,4,...) and e1 at odd times (1,3,5,...).

Step 2 — Interpret the Ci conditions (read X as “in the next state”)
- C1 = X(event2): event2 at next time.
- C2 = X(C1): C1 holds in the next time.
- C3 = C2 and event2.
- C4 = C3 or event2.
- C5 = X(event2) (same as C1).
- C6 = (C4 → C5).
- C7 = eventually C6 (there exists a future time where C6 holds).

Step 3 — Evaluate along the timeline
At time 0:
- event2(0) = True, event1(1)=True, event2(2)=True, etc.
- C1(0) = event2(1) = False (time1 has event1).
- C2(0) = C1(1). C1(1) = event2(2) = True, so C2(0) = True.
- C3(0) = C2(0) and event2(0) = True and True = True.
- C4(0) = C3(0) or event2(0) = True.
- C5(0) = event2(1) = False.
- C6(0) = (C4(0) → C5(0)) = (True → False) = False.

At time 1:
- C1(1) = event2(2) = True.
- C2(1) = C1(2) = event2(3) = False (time3 is event1).
- C3(1) = C2(1) and event2(1) = False.
- C4(1) = C3(1) or event2(1) = False.
- C5(1) = event2(2) = True.
- C6(1) = (C4(1) → C5(1)) = (False → True) = True (vacuously true).

Step 4 — Conclusion
C6 holds at time 1, so “eventually C6” is true from the initial state. Therefore C7 is True.

Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context:
   - event1 happened initially.
   - After event1 no other events can happen. So once event1 has happened (and it did initially), no further event (including event2) can ever happen afterwards.
   - Therefore event2 can never occur in any reachable future.

2. Evaluate the conditions:
   - C3 = (C2 holds and event2 happens). Since event2 never happens, C3 is false.
   - C4 = C3 does not hold. Since C3 is false, C4 is true.
   - C5 is irrelevant because C4 is already true, but C6 = (C4 or C5) is therefore true (disjunction true because C4 is true).

3. C7 asserts that C6 holds in the next state. Because after the initial event1 nothing changes that would make C4 false (C3 remains false forever), C6 remains true in all subsequent states. Thus C6 is true in the next state, so C7 is true.

Therefore C7 is True.
---
True

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Initially event1 happened. The rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" means event2 can never occur after that initial event1.
- C3 = (C2 holds and event2 happens). Because event2 cannot happen, C3 is false.
- C4 = ""C3 does not hold"" is therefore true.
- C6 = (C4 holds or C5 holds) is true because C4 is true (no need to consider C5).
- Nothing that can occur after the initial event1 can make event2 happen (by the second rule), so C4 remains true in every subsequent state. Hence C6 remains true in the next state.
- Therefore C7 (""C6 holds in the next state"") is True.
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 occurred.
- “After event1, no other events can happen” means once that initial event1 has happened, no further events (including event2) can occur thereafter.
- “After event2, event1 must happen” places a requirement on any occurrence of event2, but it does not force event2 to occur.

Step 2 — evaluate the relevant conditions
- C3 = (C2 holds) and (event2 happens). Because event1 already happened initially and no other events can happen after it, event2 cannot occur now or ever. Therefore C3 is false.
- C4 = “C3 does not hold” — since C3 is false, C4 is true.
- C6 = C4 or C5 — since C4 is true, C6 is true (regardless of C5).
- C7 = “C6 holds in the next state.” C6 is already true now and nothing in the context forces it to become false in the next state (in particular, no events can occur to change facts about C3/C4/C6), so C6 still holds in the next state.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
The hypothesis asks whether C7 (which is ""C5 holds and C6 holds"") is true given the context.

Step-by-step:

- Context forces the sequence: event2 has happened initially; after event2 event1 must happen; after event1 no further events can occur. So event2 does occur (already), and event1 will occur later; nothing can make event2 un-happen.

- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" True — event2 already happened, and event1 only occurs after event2, so whenever event1 happens, event2 has happened.

- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" False, because C1 does hold.

- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" False — C2 is false now and nothing in the allowed sequence can make C1 cease to hold, so C2 never becomes true.

- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" True, since C3 is false.

- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" False, because C4 is true.

- C6: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" True (same as C1).

- C7: ""C5 holds and C6 holds."" Since C5 is false and C6 is true, the conjunction is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — events timeline from the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → therefore event1 will (and does) occur after the initial event2.
- After event1, no other events can happen → event1 is terminal.
So the actual event sequence is: event2 (initial) → event1 → nothing else.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Given the sequence, event1 does occur and event2 did happen (earlier), so C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This contradicts C1, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 is false and there is no mechanism for it becoming true later, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is false, C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" C4 is true, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Same as C1, so C6 is true.
- C7: ""C5 holds and C6 holds."" C5 is false and C6 is true, so the conjunction is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — timeline from the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → so event1 will occur after that.
- After event1, no other events can happen → the run is: event2, then event1, then nothing else.

Step 2 — evaluate conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" In the only possible run event2 already happened before event1, so whenever event1 happens event2 does happen. Therefore C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is true, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 is false now and nothing in the future can make C2 true (there are no possible further events after event1, and the truth of C1 is not overturned). So C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is false, C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" C4 is true, so C5 is false.
- C6: same as C1, ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This is true.
- C7: ""C5 holds and C6 holds."" C5 is false and C6 is true, so the conjunction is false.

Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is True or False given the context and the chain of conditions C1–C6.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen → once event1 has occurred, event2 can never occur (and no other events occur).
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is vacuously satisfied because event2 never occurs.

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" False (event2 never happens).
- C2: ""Event2 always happens."" Same as C1, False.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is false, C3 is False.
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" This implication is true because C1 is false (false → anything is true).
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" C4 is a logical implication whose truth does not change over time here, so C5 is True.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" Since C5 is globally true, it also holds in the next state, so C6 is True.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" C6 is already true in the next state, so it certainly holds at some future time. Therefore C7 is True.

Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" ⇒ once event1 has occurred (and it already did initially), no event2 can ever occur later.
- The rule ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 cannot occur (event1 already happened and prevents any further events).

Step 3 — evaluate the Cs
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" False (event2 cannot happen because event1 already occurred and prevents any further events).
- C2: same as C1 — False.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" False (C2 is false, so it does not ""always hold"").
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" This implication is vacuously true because C1 is false, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" Since C4 is true (and remains true at every state), C5 is true.

- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" C6 already holds now, so it certainly holds eventually. Therefore C7 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From context: event1 occurs initially and after event1 no further events can occur. Therefore no event can ever occur after the initial state. In particular, event2 never happens.

2. C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is false (event2 does not happen). C2 is the same and false. C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false because C2 is false.

3. C4 (""If C1 holds, then C3 holds"") is true: the implication has a false antecedent (C1), so it holds.

4. C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true because C4 is true in the only reachable state(s).

5. C6 (""C5 holds in the next state"") is false: there is no next state after the initial state (no events can occur), so ""in the next state"" is not satisfied.

6. C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is false because C6 is never true in any (future) state.

Therefore C7 is False."

- We must decide whether C6 (""If C2 holds, then C5 holds"") is true or false given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → therefore event2 does happen (sometime after the initial event1).
- After event2, event1 must happen → hence event1 and event2 alternate and both occur (so at least one occurrence of event2 and event1 exist).

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" Since event2 does happen, C1 is true (the duplicate conjunction is satisfied).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" C1 is true and event1 does happen (it was true initially), so the implication C2 is true.

Conclusion
True
---
Goal: decide whether C6 (""If C2 holds, then C5 holds"") is true given the context and the listed conditions.

1) Interpret the context and propositions
- Context: Initially event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, event1 must happen. So starting from an initial event1, event2 will occur later, then event1 again, etc. Hence both event1 and event2 do occur (indeed repeatedly) in every model satisfying the context.
- Let E1 = ""event1 happens"" (true at some time, in fact initially), E2 = ""event2 happens"" (true later).

2) Examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — equivalent to E2 (it asserts E2). Given the context, E2 does occur, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"" — i.e. C1 → E1. C1 is true and E1 is true (initially), so this implication holds; C2 is true.
- C3: same as C2, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens"" — C3 → E2. C3 is true and E2 is true, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" — since C4 is already true, it certainly holds (and thus eventually holds). So C5 is true.
- C6: ""If C2 holds, then C5 holds"" — C2 is true and C5 is true, so the implication C2 → C5 is true.

3) Conclusion
All the antecedents and consequents in the chain are true under the given context, so C6 holds.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — understand the context
- Initially event1 happens.
- After any event1, an event2 must happen (so event2 will occur after the initial event1).
- After any event2, an event1 must happen (so event1 will occur after that event2).
Thus the system yields event1, then event2, then event1, then event2, ... — both events do occur (infinitely often).

Step 2 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — equivalent to ""event2 happens"". From the context, event2 does happen (after the initial event1). So C1 is true.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" C1 is true and event1 does happen (initially and repeatedly), so the implication C2 is true.
- C3: same as C2, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens."" C3 is true and event2 does happen, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" C4 already holds now, so it certainly holds eventually. Thus C5 is true.
- C6: ""If C2 holds, then C5 holds."" C2 is true and C5 is true, so the implication C6 is true.

- The context says: after event2, no other events can happen. So in every state after s0 (s1, s2, ...), no events occur; in particular event2 does not occur in any successor state.
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" At s0, the next state s1 does not have event2, so C1 is false at s0. And because event2 never happens after s0, C1 is false in every state.
- C2 and C3: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 never holds in any future state, C2 and C3 are false.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" C3 is false everywhere, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C2 holds and C4 holds."" Both conjuncts are false, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" Since C5 is false in every state, C6 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Reasoning (concise):

- Let s0 be the initial state (event2 occurred at s0). By ""after event2, no other events can happen"", no events occur at s1, s2, ...
- C1 = ""event2 happens in the next state"" → at s0 this requires event2 at s1, but s1 has no events, so C1 is false at s0 (and indeed false at every state).
- C2 and C3 = ""eventually C1"" → since C1 is never true, C2 and C3 are false.
- C4 = ""C3 holds in the next state"" → false because C3 is false everywhere.
- C5 = C2 and C4 → false.
- C6 = ""C5 holds in the next state"" → false.

False"

Sample responses:
Reasoning step-by-step:

- From the context: initially event1 has happened, and “after event1, no other events can happen.” Since event1 already holds initially, no further events (including event2) can ever occur in any future state.
- Therefore C1 (""event2 happens and event1 happens"") cannot hold in any trace (event2 is impossible).
- C7 is the implication ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds."" An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true.
- So C7 is true (regardless of the truth of C6).

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning (brief):
- Context forces event1 to happen initially and then no events can occur afterward, so event2 never happens in any allowed trace.
- Therefore C1 (event2 and event1) is never true.
- An implication ""If C1 then C6"" is vacuously true when C1 can never hold.
- Hence C7 is True.
---
Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Context: initially event1 has happened. After event1 no other events can happen. Therefore event2 never occurs in the system (there is no state after the initial state where an event could occur).

- C1 / C2: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" Event1 does happen (initially) but event2 never happens, so C1 and C2 are false.

- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — since C2 is false, C3 is true (at the initial state).

- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" There is no next state (event1 is terminal), so next(C3) is false (standard next is false in a state with no successor). Hence C4 is false.

- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" — since C4 is false, C5 is true (already true in the initial state).

- C6: ""C5 eventually holds"" — because C5 holds now, it certainly eventually holds, so C6 is true.

- C7: ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds."" C1 is false in the model, so the implication is vacuously true (and in fact C6 is true anyway). Therefore C7 is True."

Sample responses:
You ask whether C6 is true or false. We'll evaluate each condition using the given scenario.

Context summary:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 does occur at some point).
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Step-by-step evaluation:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Given event2 initially occurred and the context requires event1 to happen afterward, event1 does occur. So C1 holds (True).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is the negation of C1. Since C1 is True, C2 is False.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" Event1 happens, so C3 is True (regardless of C2).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 already holds, so C4 is True.
- C5: ""C1 does not hold."" Same as C2, so C5 is False.
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" That is True AND False, which is False.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- We must evaluate whether C6 (C4 holds and C5 holds) is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — use the context to determine events:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → event1 does happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen (irrelevant to whether event1 occurs).

Step 3 — evaluate each condition:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Given event2 happened initially and after event2 event1 must happen, C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is the negation of C1, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" Event1 does happen, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Since C3 is true, C4 is true.
- C5: ""C1 does not hold."" Same as C2, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" This requires both true; C4 is true but C5 is false, so C6 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
True

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

- From the context the only possible run is: event2 occurs initially, then event1 must occur, and after event1 nothing else can happen. So the sequence is event2 → event1 (and then termination).
- C1 (""Event1 always happens"") — interpreted as a universal/global claim that event1 holds at all times — is false (event1 does not hold at the initial moment when event2 occurred, it only holds afterward). So C1 does not hold.
- C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is therefore true.
- C3 (""C2 holds or event1 happens"") is true (in fact C2 is true, and event1 also happens).
- C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true because C3 already holds.
- C5 is the same as C2, so it is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1) C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (P → P), so C1 holds.

2) C2: ""C1 always holds."" Because C1 holds at every point, C2 holds.

3) C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" If C2 holds now (indeed always), then it certainly holds at some future (or current) time — so C3 holds.

4) C4: ""C3 holds and event2 happens."" C3 holds, and by the context event2 does occur (after the initial event1), so C4 is true at least at the time when event2 happens.

5) C5: ""C4 always holds."" This would require C4 to be true at every time. But C4 includes the atomic occurrence ""event2 happens"", which is true only at the moment(s) when event2 occurs, not at all times. Thus C4 is not true at every time, so C5 does not hold (C5 is false).

6) C6: ""C5 does not hold."" Since C5 is false, C6 is true.

7) C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" C6 already holds (it is true whenever evaluated), so it certainly holds at some time — hence C7 is true.

Therefore C7 is True.
---
True

Step-by-step reasoning:

- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens"" is a tautology (always true whenever evaluated).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" is true because C1 is a tautology.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" is true (if something holds always, it certainly holds at some future point).
- C4: ""C3 holds and event2 happens"" is true at the moment(s) when event2 occurs (C3 is true and event2 must occur after event1 by the context).
- C5: ""C4 always holds"" is false, because C4 is only true at the time(s) of event2 and not at all times.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold"" is true (since C5 is false).
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds"" is true — in fact C6 already holds, so it certainly holds eventually.

Therefore C7 is True.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Timeline: at time t0 event1 has happened; by the context event2 must happen after event1, so at some later time t1 event2 occurs; after t1 no further events occur.
- C1 (event1 → event1) is a tautology, so it holds at all times.
- C2 (C1 always holds) is true because C1 is always true.
- C3 (C2 eventually holds) is true (indeed C2 holds immediately and therefore eventually).
- C4 (C3 holds and event2 happens) is true at time t1 (C3 holds and event2 occurs then), though false at times before t1.
- C5 (C4 always holds) is false because C4 does not hold at times before t1.
- C6 (C5 does not hold) is therefore true (already true at t0).
- C7 (C6 eventually holds) is true because C6 holds already (hence it certainly holds eventually).

Thus C7 is True."

Sample responses:
What the hypothesis asks
- C7 asserts that ""C6 always holds."" So we must check whether C6 is true in the given situation at every relevant moment (given the context).

Given facts (from the context)
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Immediate consequences
1. Because event1 happened initially and after event1 no further events can happen, event2 cannot happen at any time. So ""Event2 does not happen"" is true.
2. Call that fact: C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is true.

Evaluate the Ci conditions
- C1: Event2 does not happen — true (from above).
- C2: Event1 happens or C1 holds — true because event1 did happen (and C1 also holds).
- C3: Event2 does not happen — same as C1, true.
- C4: Event2 does not happen — same, true.
- C5: C3 holds or C4 holds — true because both C3 and C4 are true.
- C6: C2 holds or C5 holds — true because both C2 and C5 are true.

About ""always holds"" (C7)
- Since event1 happened initially and that prevents any further events, the truth values above cannot change in the future. C6 is true now and there are no possible future changes that could make it false, so C6 holds at all times.
- Therefore C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true.

Final answer
True
---
Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Context: initially event1 happened. Also, after event1 no other events can happen — so once event1 has happened, no further events (including event2) can ever occur.
- Therefore event2 does not happen. So C1 (and hence C3 and C4) is true.
- C2 is ""event1 happens or C1 holds"" — event1 did happen, so C2 is true.
- C5 (""C3 or C4"") is true because both C3 and C4 are true. C6 (""C2 or C5"") is thus true.
- C6 simplifies to ""event1 happened or event2 does not happen."" Given event1 did happen and event2 cannot happen at any later time, C6 is true at every point in the timeline.
- Therefore C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event1 happened. Also, after event1 no other events can happen. Therefore event2 does not happen.
- C1 (event2 does not happen) is true.
- C2 (event1 happens or C1) is true because event1 happened.
- C3 and C4 (both ""event2 does not happen"") are true.
- C5 (C3 or C4) is true.
- C6 (C2 or C5) is true.
- Because nothing else can occur after event1, these facts cannot be overturned over time, so C6 holds at all times; hence C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true."

1. From the context: initially event1 happened. So event1 does happen (at least at the initial time).
2. C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This contradicts the context, so C1 is false.
3. C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true.
4. C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 already holds now, so C3 is true (it holds eventually as well).

You are asking whether C6 (""C5 eventually holds"") is true given the context. Step-by-step:

1. Context: event1 occurs initially, and thereafter event1 and event2 alternate (after event1 must come event2, after event2 must come event1). So event1 does happen (in fact infinitely often).

2. C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This contradicts the context, so C1 is false.

3. C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true.

4. C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 already holds from the start, so C3 is true.

5. C4: ""C1 does not hold."" Same as C2, so C4 is true.

6. C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" Both antecedent and consequent are true, so the implication C5 is true.

7. C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" C5 holds already, so C6 is true.

Final answer: True

Step 1 — evaluate C1:
- Context says event1 happened initially. C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is false.

Step 2 — C2:
- C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" = not C1. Since C1 is false, C2 is true.

Step 3 — C3:

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Interpret time states t = 0,1,2,... and let E1(t) mean ""event1 holds at t"" and E2(t) mean ""event2 holds at t"". The context gives:
- E1(0) is true (initially event1).
- After event1, event2 must happen: for all t, E1(t) → E2(t+1).
- After event2, event1 must happen: for all t, E2(t) → E1(t+1).

From these rules, events alternate: E1 holds at all even t and E2 holds at all odd t.

Now evaluate the Ci predicates (at an arbitrary time t):

- C1(t): ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" = E2(t) ∧ E1(t). Because E1 and E2 never hold simultaneously under the alternating behavior, C1(t) is false for every t.
- C2(t): ""Event2 happens or C1 holds"" = E2(t) ∨ C1(t) = E2(t). So C2 holds exactly at odd t.
- C3(t): ""C2 holds in the next state"" = C2(t+1) = E2(t+1). Since E2 holds at odd indices, E2(t+1) is true exactly when t is even. So C3 holds at even t.
- C4(t): ""C3 eventually holds"" = there exists m ≥ t with C3(m). Because C3 holds at every even index and there is always an even index ≥ t (either t itself if even, or t+1 if odd), C4(t) is true for every t.
- C5(t): ""C4 holds in the next state"" = C4(t+1). Since C4 holds at every state, C5(t) is true for every t.
- C6(t): ""C5 eventually holds"" = there exists m ≥ t with C5(m). Since C5 holds everywhere, C6(t) is true for every t.
- C7(t): ""C6 always holds"" = for all m ≥ t, C6(m). Because C6 holds at every state, C7(t) is true for every t.

Thus C7 is true. 

Final answer:
True

Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step

1) Interpret the context as standard linear-time temporal relations:
   - Initially event1 is true at state s0.
   - ""After event1, event2 must happen"" = G(event1 -> X event2).
   - ""After event2, event1 must happen"" = G(event2 -> X event1).
   Thus the states must alternate: s0: event1, s1: event2, s2: event1, s3: event2, … (possibly both could co-occur, but the rules force at least this alternating pattern).

2) Evaluate C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens.""
   - In the alternating trace no state has both simultaneously, so C1 is false at every state.

3) C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds.""
   - Since C1 is always false, C2 is equivalent to ""event2"". So C2 is true exactly at the odd states s1, s3, … and false at even states s0, s2, …

4) C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" (X C2).
   - That is true at every even state, because the next state after an even state is odd where C2 (event2) holds. In particular C3 is true at s0.

5) C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" (F C3).
   - Because C3 holds at s0 (and in general at every even state), F C3 is true at every state (there is always a future state where C3 holds).

6) C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" (X C4).
   - Since C4 is true at every state, X C4 is true at every state, so C5 holds everywhere.

7) C6: ""C5 eventually holds"" (F C5).
   - C5 is true everywhere, so F C5 is true everywhere; C6 holds at every state.

8) C7: ""C6 always holds"" (G C6).
   - Because C6 holds at every state, G C6 is true.

Therefore C7 is True.

Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step (all truth values evaluated at the initial state unless otherwise noted):

1. The scenario: event1 occurs initially. After event1 no other events can happen, so there is a next state (and any further states) but in every later state event1 does not occur.

2. C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" At the initial state this is false (event1 did happen).

3. C2: same as C1, so false in the initial state.

4. C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" In the next state event1 does not happen, so C2 is true there. Therefore C3 is true in the initial state.

5. C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is true, C4 is false in the initial state.

6. C5: ""C1 holds and C4 holds."" Both conjuncts are false, so C5 is false in the initial state.

7. C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" Evaluate C5 in the next state: C1 in the next state is true (event1 does not happen there), but C4 in the next state is still false (C3 is true in the next state as well), so C5 is false in the next state. Hence C6 is false in the initial state.

8. C7: ""C6 does not hold."" Since C6 is false, C7 is true.

Thus C7 is True.
---
You ask whether C7 (""C6 does not hold"") is true given the context. I'll evaluate each condition step by step in the initial state s0 and the subsequent states.

Context summary:
- s0 (initial): event1 happened.
- After event1 (i.e. in s1 and onward) no events happen, so in s1, s2, ... event1 does not happen.

Now evaluate the Ci in s0:

- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" In s0 event1 did happen → C1 is False.
- C2: same as C1 → C2 is False in s0.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" In s1, event1 does not happen, so C2 is True in s1 → C3 is True in s0.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is True in s0 → C4 is False in s0.
- C5: ""C1 holds and C4 holds."" C1 is False and C4 is False → C5 is False in s0.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" Evaluate C5 in s1: in s1, C1 (event1 does not happen) is True, but C4 in s1 is still False (by the same kind of evaluation), so C5 is False in s1 → C6 is False in s0.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" Since C6 is False in s0, C7 is True.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (stepwise):
- The context enforces an alternating timeline: s0 has event1, s1 has event2, s2 has event1, etc.
- C1 and C2 are ""event2 and event2"", i.e. equivalent to ""event2"" — true in states s1, s3, ...
- C3 = C2 and event1, i.e. requires event2 and event1 in the same state. That never happens under the alternation, so C3 is false in every state.
- C4 is ""if C3 then event2"". Since C3 is always false, C4 is vacuously true in every state.
- C5 says ""C4 holds in the next state"". Because C4 holds everywhere, C5 is true.
- C6 is ""C5 or event1"". With C5 true, C6 is true.
- C7 is ""C1 or C6"". With C6 true, C7 is true.

Thus C7 is True.
---
We are asked whether C7 holds in the initial state.

Context timeline:
- At t0 (initial): event1 is true.
- After event1, event2 must happen, so at t1: event2 is true.
- After event2, event1 must happen, so at t2: event1 is true, etc.

Evaluate the conditions at t0:
- C1: ""event2 and event2"" — false at t0 (event2 is not true at t0).
- C2: same as C1 — false at t0.
- C3: C2 and event1 — false (C2 is false, though event1 is true).
- C4: (C3 -> event2) — true at any time when C3 is false (implication holds vacuously).
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" — at t0, check t1: at t1 C3 is false (event1 is false there) so C4 is true at t1; therefore C5 is true at t0.
- C6: ""C5 or event1"" — true at t0 because both C5 and event1 are true.
- C7: ""C1 or C6"" — true at t0 because C6 is true.

Therefore C7 is True.
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially (state 0) event1 happened. After any state where event1 happens, event2 must happen in the next state. After any state where event2 happens, event1 must happen in the next state.
- So the system alternates: state0: event1, state1: event2, state2: event1, etc.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition at the initial state (state0)
- C1: ""event2 and event2"" — equivalent to event2 at state0. False (state0 has event1, not event2).
- C2: same as C1 — False at state0.
- C3: C2 and event1 — requires event2 and event1 in the same state. False at state0 (event2 false).
- C4: ""If C3 then event2"" — an implication with false antecedent, so C4 is True at state0 (vacuously true).
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" — check state1. In state1 event2 holds, event1 does not, so C3 is false in state1 and thus C4 is also true in state1. Therefore C5 is True at state0.
- C6: ""C5 holds or event1 happens"" — at state0 event1 does happen, and we also found C5 is true, so C6 is True at state0.
- C7: ""C1 holds or C6 holds"" — C1 is False but C6 is True, so C7 is True at state0.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (stepwise):
- Initially event1 has happened, so ""event1 happens"" is true in the current state.
- C5 = (event1 happens) or C4, so C5 is true because event1 is true.
- C6 = C5 and event1 happens, so C6 is true (both conjuncts true).
- C7 = C6 and event1 happens, so C7 is true as well.

(Notes about other clauses: C1 is false because after event1 no events can happen; C2 then holds; C3 holds vacuously in all future states because there are no further states after event1. C4, which asserts C3 in the next state, is irrelevant to the truth of C7 because event1 already makes C5 true.)
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
- We must evaluate whether C7 (""C6 holds and event1 happens"") is true or false given the context and the chain of conditions C1–C6.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 is true at the initial/current state).
- After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 ever occurs, event1 must occur subsequently).
- After event1, no other events can happen (there is no next state with further events once event1 has occurred).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions in order
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Given event1 has already happened and no events can happen afterward, event2 does not occur. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" C2 is true in the current (and only) state; there are no subsequent states (no further events), so C3 holds (vacuously/indeed true across the trace).
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" There is no next state (no events after event1), so C4 is false.
- C5: ""Event1 happens or C4 holds."" Event1 happens (true), so C5 is true (the disjunction holds).
- C6: ""C5 holds and event1 happens."" C5 is true and event1 happens, so C6 is true.
- C7: ""C6 holds and event1 happens."" C6 is true and event1 happens, so C7 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context: event1 happened initially, and ""after event1 no other events can happen."" So event1 holds in the current (initial) state and there are no further events/states.
- C1 (Event2 always happens): False, because no events can happen after the initial event1, so event2 cannot always occur.
- C2 (C1 does not hold): True (since C1 is false).
- C3 (C2 always holds): True — C2 is true now and nothing can change it (no further states), so it holds in all states.
- C4 (C3 holds in the next state): There is no next state (so C4 is false/does not hold), but this won't matter for the rest.
- C5 (event1 happens or C4 holds): True, because event1 happens in the initial state.
- C6 (C5 holds and event1 happens): True (both parts true).
- C7 (C6 holds and event1 happens): True (again both parts true).

Therefore C7 is True."

The hypothesis asks whether C6 (""If C4 holds, then C5 holds"") is True or False.

Step-by-step evaluation using the context:
- Context implies event2 occurs initially, and then event1 must occur; after event1 nothing else can happen. So both event2 and event1 do happen (in that order).
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — equivalent to event1 happens. True.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — i.e. event1 does not happen. False.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — i.e. not(¬C1) = C1. True.
- C4: ""C3 holds and event2 happens"" — since C3 is true (event1) and event2 also happens, C4 is True.
- C5: ""C1 does not hold"" — same as C2, False.
- C6: ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds"" — here C4 is True and C5 is False, so the implication is False.

Final answer: False
---
We want to know whether C6 (""If C4 holds, then C5 holds"") is true given the context and the other conditions.

Context summary:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → event1 does happen (after the initial event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" Since event1 does happen, C1 is True.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" C1 holds, so C2 is False.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" C2 is False, so C3 is True.
- C4: ""C3 holds and event2 happens."" C3 is True and event2 did happen initially, so C4 is True.
- C5: ""C1 does not hold."" C1 holds, so C5 is False.

Now C6: ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds."" We have C4 = True and C5 = False, so the implication True → False is False.

Final answer: False
---
You ask whether C6 is true given the context. Step-by-step:

1. Context:
- Initially event2 happened (so event2 is true).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will happen).
- After event1 no other events can happen (no further events after event1; not relevant to truth of event1).

Thus event1 does happen (C1 is true).

2. Simplify the conditions:
- C1: event1 happens (true).
- C2: not C1 (false).
- C3: not C2 = C1 (true).
- C4: C3 and event2 = C1 and true = C1 (true).
- C5: not C1 (false).
- C6: C4 -> C5 which is C1 -> not C1. An implication p -> not p is equivalent to not p, so C6 is true exactly when C1 is false.

3. Since C1 is true, C6 is false (true implies false gives false).

Step 1 — what’s asked
- We must decide whether C6 (""C4 holds or C5 holds"") is True or False given the context and the listed conditions.

Step 2 — use the context
- Context says event1 happened (initially) and then event2 must happen. So event1 did happen, and event2 does happen.

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Given the context, C1 is false.
- C2: ""Event1 does not happen."" Same as C1, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" C2 is false, so the implication is true (an implication with a false antecedent is true). Also event2 does happen in the context, so C3 is true regardless.
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" C1 is false, so this implication is true.
- C5: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" Same as C3, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""C4 holds or C5 holds."" Since C4 and C5 are both true, the disjunction is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the question:
C6 is the disjunction ""C4 holds or C5 holds"". We must determine whether C6 is true given the context.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions against the context:
- Context says: event1 happened initially. So the propositions ""Event1 does not happen"" (C1 and C2) are both false.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" Antecedent C1 is false, so the implication C4 is true.
- C5: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" Same as C3, true because C2 is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C6:
C6 = C4 or C5. Both C4 and C5 are true, so C6 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
We are asked whether C6 (C4 holds or C5 holds) is true given the context.

1. From the context: event1 happened. So the statement ""event1 does not happen"" is false. Therefore C1 = false and C2 = false.
2. C3 is ""if C2 holds, then event2 happens."" An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C3 = true.
3. C4 is ""if C1 holds, then C3 holds."" Since C1 is false, that implication is true, so C4 = true.
4. C5 is identical to C3, so C5 = true.
5. C6 = C4 or C5, and since both are true, C6 = true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
We want to know whether C7 (Always(C6)) follows from the context and the given C1–C6.

1) Interpret the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen → once event2 has occurred, event1 can never occur (no further events ever happen).
So ¬event1 holds in the initial state and in every reachable state.

2) Simplify the conditions:
- C1 = ¬event1.
- C2 = event1 ∨ C1 = event1 ∨ ¬event1, which is a tautology (true in every state).
- C3 = event2 ∨ C2 = event2 ∨ True = True in every state.
- C4 = Next(C3) = Next(True) — whether or not there is a next state, C3 is true in any state that exists; if there is no successor the Next conjunct can be ignored because C6 has the other disjunct (see next).
- C5 = ¬event1 (same as C1), and from the context ¬event1 holds in all states.
- C6 = C4 ∨ C5 = Next(C3) ∨ ¬event1. Since ¬event1 is true in every state (no events can occur after the initial event2), C6 is true in every state.

3) Therefore Always(C6) (C7) holds.

Final answer: True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context: initially event2 happened, and ""after event2 no other events can happen."" Because event2 happens initially, no event (in particular event1) can ever happen later. Therefore C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is true.

2. C2 is ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" Since C1 is true, C2 is true.

3. C3 is ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" C2 is true, so C3 is true.

4. C4 is ""C3 holds in the next state."" C1 is a global fact (event1 never happens), so C2 and hence C3 also hold in the next state; therefore C4 is true.

5. C5 repeats C1, so C5 is true.

6. C6 is ""C4 holds or C5 holds."" Since C5 (and C4) is true, C6 is true.

7. C7 is ""C6 always holds."" Because C5 (event1 never happens) holds at every state, C6 holds at every state, so C7 is true.

Thus C7 is True.
---
True

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

1. From the context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. Therefore event1 never happens — C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is true.

2. C2 is ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"". Since C1 is true, C2 is true. Then C3 (""Event2 happens or C2 holds"") is true because C2 is true.

3. C4 says ""C3 holds in the next state."" But there is no next state (after event2 no events can happen). Regardless of the truth value of C4, C5 (""Event1 does not happen"") is true (same as C1).

4. C6 is ""C4 holds or C5 holds"". Since C5 is true, C6 is true in the (only) state.

5. C7 is ""C6 always holds"". There are no further states where C6 could fail (after the initial state no events/states follow), so C6 holds in every state of the run. Therefore C7 is true."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — question
- The hypothesis asks whether C7 is True or False.

Step 2 — interpret context and conditions
- Context: event2 happened (so event2 is true).
- C7 is ""C6 holds or event2 happens"" (C7 = C6 ∨ event2).
- C5 = C4 ∨ event2.
- C6 = ""C5 does not hold"" = ¬C5 = ¬(C4 ∨ event2).

Step 3 — evaluate with the context
- Since event2 is true, C5 = C4 ∨ event2 is true.
- Therefore C6 = ¬C5 is false.
- Finally, C7 = C6 ∨ event2 = false ∨ true = true.

Conclusion
- True
---
Step 1 — identify question:
- We must determine the truth of C7 (""C6 holds or event2 happens"").

Step 2 — use the context:
- Context says event2 happened initially. So event2 is True.

Step 3 — evaluate conditions that depend on event2:
- C5 is ""C4 holds or event2 happens"". Since event2 is True, C5 is True.
- C6 is ""C5 does not hold"" (i.e., not C5). But C5 is True, so C6 is False.
- C7 is ""C6 holds or event2 happens"". event2 is True, so the disjunction is True (regardless of C6).

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — facts from the context
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 is true.
- After event2, no other events can happen → event1 did not happen (since event2 already happened).
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant because event1 did not occur.

Step 2 — evaluate the C's
- C1 (event1 → event2): true (vacuously, because event1 did not happen).
- C2 (event1 → event2): same as C1, so true.
- C3 (C2 always holds): true, because C2 is true.
- C4 (C1 → C3): true, because C1 is true and C3 is true.
- C5 (C4 or event2): true (C4 is true, and event2 is also true).
- C6 (C5 does not hold): false (since C5 is true).
- C7 (C6 or event2): true (event2 is true, so the disjunction holds).

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C5 (which is C3 or C4) is true given the initial conditions and rules about events.

Step 2 — interpret the background rules
- Initially (time 0) event2 happens (so event2 is true at time 0).
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant because event1 never occurs in the scenario below.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" means that once event2 has happened, there are no events in any later state (time 1, time 2, ...).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions step by step (at time 0)
- C1: ""event2 and event2"" — true at time 0 (since event2 holds at time 0).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — asks whether C1 is true at time 1. But after event2 no events occur at time 1, so event2 is false at time 1 and thus C1 is false at time 1. Therefore C2 is false at time 0.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — asks whether C2 is true at time 1. At time 1, by the same reasoning, C2 is false (because at time 2 there are no events, so C1 is false at time 2). Thus C3 is false at time 0.
- C4: same as C3, so false at time 0.
- C5: C3 or C4 — false or false = false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — parse the context
- s0 is the initial state and event2 holds at s0.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" means: whenever event1 happens at some state, event2 must occur afterward (not needed in this trace because event1 does not occur).
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" means that once event2 happens, no further events occur in later states (i.e. no future state can make event1 or event2 true).

Step 2 — decode the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — this is just a (redundant) claim that event2 holds in the current state; so C1 is true at any state where event2 holds (in particular true at s0).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — requires event2 to hold in the next state s1.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — requires C1 to hold in s2 (two steps ahead).
- C4: same as C3 (duplicate).
- C5: C3 or C4 — equivalent to C3 (since C3 and C4 are identical).

Step 3 — trace given the constraints
- At s0 event2 holds (C1 true at s0).
- But ""after event2, no other events can happen"" means no future state can have event2 true. So in s1 and later, event2 is false.
- Therefore C1 is false in s1, so C2 is false. Then C3 and C4 are false, and hence C5 is false.

Final answer: False
---
First identify the question: C5 is ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" We must decide whether C5 is true given the context.

Interpret the conditions:
- Initial state S0: event2 happened (so ""event2 happens"" is true in S0).
- After event2, no other events can happen — event2 is terminal: there is no next state in which any event happens (and in particular no next state where event2 happens).
- C1: ""event2 happens and event2 happens"" — equivalent to ""event2 happens"". So C1 is true in S0.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — requires a next state where C1 is true. But there is no next state after event2 (or, if there is a next state, event2 does not happen there), so C2 is false in S0.
- C3 and C4: each is ""C2 holds in the next state"" — both require a next state where C2 is true; since C2 is false (and there is no next state where C1/event2 holds), C3 and C4 are false.
- C5 = C3 or C4 is therefore false (false OR false).

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
You ask whether C6 is True or False given the context and the conditions C1–C5. C6 is the statement ""Event2 happens and C5 holds.""

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. (So no events occur in any state after the state where event2 occurred; this forbids any event happening in the next state.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (Not needed here beyond symmetry.)

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" The context forbids any event after the initial event2, so event2 cannot happen in the next state. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Since C1 is false, the implication C1 → event1 is vacuously true. So C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This contradicts the previous line, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" This is the same as C2, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" Since C4 is true, C5 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C6
C6 requires both ""Event2 happens (in the next state)"" and C5. The ""Event2 happens"" part is exactly C1, which we found false. Although C5 is true, the conjunction fails because event2 does not happen in the next state.

Final answer
False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
We must decide whether C6 (""Event2 happens and C5 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — context summary
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so in the next state, no events occur).
- Also after event1 no other events can happen (not needed here).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Since event2 already happened initially and no events can happen after event2, event2 does NOT happen in the next state. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" A conditional with a false antecedent is true (vacuously). So C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is true, C3 is false.
- C4: same as C2, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" C3 is false, C4 is true, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""Event2 happens and C5 holds."" The event2 part (in the next state) is false (from C1), even though C5 is true; a conjunction with a false conjunct is false.

Final answer
False
---
We are asked whether C6 is true.

Step-by-step:

- From the context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. So in the next state (after the initial state) no events occur. Therefore C1 (""Event2 happens in the next state"") is false.
- C2 and C4 are both implications ""If C1 then event1"". Since C1 is false, each implication is vacuously true. So C2 = True and C4 = True.
- C3 is ""C2 does not hold"", but C2 holds, so C3 = False.
- C5 is ""C3 holds or C4 holds"". With C3 false and C4 true, C5 = True.
- C6 is ""Event2 happens and C5 holds"". Event2 did happen initially, so ""Event2 happens"" is true, and we just found C5 = True. Thus C6 = True.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 is just ""event2 happens"" (the disjunction is redundant). That is true in the initial state because the context says event2 happened initially.
- C2 (""if event1 happens then C1"") holds vacuously: from the initial state event1 never happens (after event2 no further events can happen), so the antecedent is never true and the implication is true in all reachable states.
- C3 (""C2 always holds"") therefore holds in every reachable state.
- C4 is ""C3 holds in the next state"". But there is no next state after the initial state (after event2 no other events can happen), so next(C3) is false.
- Consequently C5 and C6 (further nexts) are false as well.
- C7 is ""C6 eventually holds"". Since C6 is false now and there are no future states in which it could become true, the eventuality fails.

Thus C7 is False.
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
- We must decide whether C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. In particular, event1 can never happen after the initial state.
- (Also: after event1 no other events can happen — irrelevant because event1 never occurs here.)

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is simply true in the initial state because event2 did happen.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Since event1 never happens in any reachable state (event2 already happened and no further events occur), the implication is vacuously true in every state.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Given the previous point, C2 is true at every time, so C3 holds.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" Because C3 holds at all times (including the next state, if any), C4 holds.
- C5 and C6: by the same reasoning (C3 holding everywhere), each of these ""holds in the next state"" formulas also holds.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" Since C6 already holds (indeed it holds immediately), the eventuality is satisfied.

Conclusion
- C7 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the goal
- We must decide whether C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — expand the conditions
- C1: event2 happens. (disjunction repeats same disjunct, so it simply says event2 happens)
- C2: if event1 happens then event2 happens. (event1 → event2)
- C3: C2 always holds. (always(event1 → event2))
- C4: C3 holds in the next state. (next(always(event1 → event2)))
- C5: C4 holds in the next state. (next^2(always(event1 → event2)))
- C6: C5 holds in the next state. (next^3(always(event1 → event2)))
- C7: eventually C6 holds. (eventually next^3(always(event1 → event2)))

Step 3 — use the context
- Initially event2 happened, so C1 is true at the initial state.
- After event2 no other events can happen. That means there are no states in which event1 occurs later; nothing can invalidate the implication event1 → event2.
- Because C1 is true at the initial state, the implication in C2 holds whenever event1 might occur; with no event1 occurrences possible after event2, C2 holds in every state.
- Therefore C3 (always C2) is true at the initial state.
- If C3 is true now, then C4, C5 and C6 (the next-shifted versions) are also true (they assert the same fact at later positions, which are satisfied because nothing can make them false).
- Since C6 already holds, ""eventually C6"" is satisfied immediately.

Conclusion
- C7 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" In the given system event1 never occurs (initially event2 happened and after event2 no further events occur). An implication with a never-true antecedent is vacuously true, so C1 is true in the reachable state(s).

- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 holds in all reachable states (there is just the initial state), C2 is true.

- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" There is no next state (event2 makes the system terminal), so X C2 (C2 in the next state) is false.

- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" That is X X C2; again there is no next state, so C4 is false.

- C5: ""C1 always holds."" Same as C2, so C5 is true.

- C6: ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds."" This is an implication with a false antecedent (C4 is false), so the implication is true.

Therefore C6 is True.
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
C6 is the formula: ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds."" We must decide whether C6 is true given the context constraints about events.

Step 2 — parse the context and the Ci formulas
- Context: initially event2 happened. After event1 no further events occur. After event2 no further events occur. So the initial state is a terminal state (event2 has occurred and there are no successor states).
- C1: event1 ⇒ event2.
- C2: C1 always holds (G C1).
- C3: C2 holds in the next state (X C2).
- C4: C3 holds in the next state (X C3), i.e. X^2 C2.
- C5: C1 always holds (same as C2).
- C6: C4 ⇒ C5 (i.e. X^2 C2 ⇒ C2).

Step 3 — evaluate the formulas in the initial (terminal) state
- C1: At the initial state event1 did not happen (event2 did), so the implication event1 ⇒ event2 is vacuously true. Thus C1 holds now.
- C2 (G C1): With no future states, ""always"" reduces to checking the current state only, so C2 also holds now.
- C3 (X C2): There is no next state, so X C2 is false in the standard semantics (next requires a successor). So C3 is false.
- C4 (X C3 = X^2 C2): also false (no two-step successor).
- C5 = C2: true.
- C6 (C4 ⇒ C5): an implication with a false antecedent is true, so C6 is true in the initial state.

Step 4 — conclusion
C6 is True.
---
Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Interpret the statements in standard temporal terms:
   - ""always"" means the property holds in the current and all future states (global/G).
   - ""holds in the next state"" is the usual next-time operator (X): it requires an actual immediate successor state.

2. From the context:
   - Initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. So the initial state is terminal — there is no next state.

3. Evaluate the conditions at the initial state:
   - C2 = ""C1 always holds"" is some global claim (may be true or false).
   - C3 = X C2 requires a next state where C2 holds. But there is no next state, so C3 is false.
   - C4 = X C3 likewise requires a next state; with no successor it is false.
   - C5 = ""C1 always holds"" (same as C2).
   - C6 is the implication (C4 -> C5). An implication with a false antecedent is true.

4. Since C4 is false at the initial (terminal) state, the implication C4 -> C5 is true (vacuously). Therefore C6 is true."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — What is being asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""If C3 holds, then C4 holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — Use the context to evaluate the Ci
- Context: initially event2 happened. Also: after event2, event1 must happen; and after event1, event2 must happen.
- From ""initially event2 happened"" and ""after event2, event1 must happen"" we conclude event1 happens. From event1 happening and ""after event1, event2 must happen"" event2 happens (again). So both event1 and event2 do happen.
- Therefore C1 (""Event1 happens and event2 happens"") is True.
- C2 (""Event1 happens or C1 holds"") is True (both disjuncts are true, so the disjunction is true).
- C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is False (since C2 holds).
- C4 (""C2 does not hold"") is also False (same as C3).

Step 3 — Evaluate C5
- C5 is the implication C3 -> C4. An implication with a false antecedent is True (vacuously true). Here C3 is False, so C5 is True.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is asked:
C5 is the statement ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" We must decide whether C5 is True or False.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions using the context:
- Context: initially event2 happened. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, event2 must happen. From this, both event2 and event1 occur (event2 initially, then event1 follows).
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" True (both occur).
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" True (C1 holds, and event1 also holds).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" False (C2 holds).
- C4: ""C2 does not hold."" False (same as C3).
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" An implication with a false antecedent (C3 is false) is true (vacuous truth).

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C5 is the statement ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" We must decide whether C5 is True or False given the context and other conditions.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → therefore event1 will happen (after the initial event2).
- After event1, event2 must happen → therefore event2 will happen (again).
- Conclusion: both event1 and event2 happen.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" Given the conclusion, C1 is True.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" Since event1 happens, C2 is True (it's logically equivalent to ""event1 happens"" here).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is True, C3 is False.
- C4: ""C2 does not hold."" Same as C3, so C4 is False.

Step 4 — evaluate C5
- C5 is ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" Here C3 and C4 are identical propositions (both False). The implication P -> P is always True (and in this case the antecedent is false, so the implication is also true).

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — model the timeline
- Initial state s0: event1 happened.
- The constraints ""after event1, event2 must happen"" and ""after event2, event1 must happen"" force strict alternation. So the states are:
  s0: event1
  s1: event2 (event1 false)
  s2: event1
  s3: event2
  ...
  (event1 true at even-index states s0, s2, …; false at odd-index states s1, s3, …)

Step 2 — interpret the Ci temporally (X = next, G = always, F = eventually)
- C1: ¬event1 (holds exactly at odd states)
- C2: X C1 (C1 in the next state) — so C2 holds at states whose successor is odd; that is, C2 holds at even states s0, s2, …
- C3: X C2 = XX C1 — C3 holds at states whose state+2 is odd; that makes C3 true at odd states s1, s3, …
- C4: ¬C3 — true at even states, false at odd states
- C5: G C4 — ""C4 always holds"". But C4 is false at odd states, so C5 is false (at every state)
- C6: ¬C5 — true (since C5 is false)
- C7: F C6 — ""eventually C6 holds"". C6 already holds immediately (in every state), so F C6 is true.

Conclusion
C7 is True.

Reasoning:

- From the context: event2 happens and then event1 must happen; therefore event1 does happen (and after it no other events can occur).

- C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is false (negation of a true statement).
- C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is false because C3 is false and remains false.
- C5 is the same as C1, so false.
- C6 (""If C4 holds, then C5 holds"") is true, because the antecedent C4 is false (a false antecedent makes the implication true).
- C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is true, since C6 already holds.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event2 has happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → event1 will occur (at some time after the start).
- After event1, no other events can happen → event1 is terminal, but that doesn't prevent event1 from occurring.

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Given the context this is false (event1 must happen).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is true, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 is false and will not become true (because C2 remains true), so C4 is false.
- C5: ""Event1 does not happen."" (same as C1) — false.
- C6: ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds."" This implication has a false antecedent (C4 is false), so C6 is true (vacuously true).
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" C6 already holds now, so it certainly holds eventually — C7 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → event1 does happen (at some later time).
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions using that event1 does occur
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" — False (event1 does happen).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" — True (negation of C1).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" — False (negation of a true statement).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" — False (C3 is false and never becomes true).
- C5: ""Event1 does not happen."" — False (same as C1).
- C6: ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds."" — True, because the antecedent C4 is false (a material implication with false antecedent is true).
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" — True, since C6 already holds immediately (so it holds at some time).

Step 1 — timeline from the context:
- State S0 (initial): event2 happened (so event2 true, event1 false).
- After event2, event1 must happen → S1: event1 true.
- After event1, event2 must happen → S2: event2 true.
So the events alternate: S0 e2, S1 e1, S2 e2, S3 e1, …

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" This is false (e.g., in S0 event1 is false).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" Since C1 is false, the implication is vacuously true (so C2 is true).
- C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" C2 is true, so this implication is true wherever event1 holds; thus C3 is true in every state.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" Because C3 holds in every state, C4 is true.
- C5: same as C2, so true.
- C6: C4 and C5 — both are true, so C6 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context: initially event2 happens (at time t0). The rules ""after event2, event1 must happen"" and ""after event1, event2 must happen"" force alternation: t0: event2, t1: event1, t2: event2, etc.
- C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false because at t0 event1 did not happen.
- C2 and C5 are conditionals of the form (C1 → event2). In classical logic, an implication with a false antecedent is true, so both C2 and C5 are true (vacuously), given C1 is false.
- C3 is ""(event1 → C2)"". At t1 event1 does happen, and C2 is true, so C3 holds at t1.
- C4 says ""C3 holds in the next state"" — that is true at t0 because at t1 (the next state) C3 does hold.
- C6 is C4 ∧ C5. We have C4 true and C5 true, hence C6 is true.
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- The hypothesis asks whether C6 (which is ""C4 holds and C5 holds"") is true.

Step 2 — interpret the context and the conditions
- Context: initially event2 happened; whenever event1 happens it is followed by event2; whenever event2 happens it is followed by event1. This yields an alternating sequence of events starting from event2.
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" This would require event1 to hold at the initial state. But the context says initially event2 happened (and not event1), so C1 is false.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" This implication has a false antecedent (C1), so C2 is true (vacuously).
- C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" C2 is true, so C3 is true (an implication with a true consequent is true).
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" Since C3 is true in all states (because C2 is true everywhere), C4 is true.
- C5: same as C2 (""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"") — true for the same vacuous reason.

Step 3 — combine for C6
- C6 is ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" Both C4 and C5 are true, so C6 is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true given the context and the chain of conditions C1–C6.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a logical tautology (p → p), so C1 is true at every state.
- C2: same as C1, also a tautology, so C2 is true at every state.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is true at every state, C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event2 happens."" C3 is true, so the disjunction is true; C4 is true at every state.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" Because C4 is true at every state, it is true in the next state as well; so C5 is true.
- C6: ""C1 holds and C5 holds."" Both C1 and C5 are true, so C6 is true at every state.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" Since C6 is true at every state, C7 is true.

Step 3 — note about the context
- The context (initial event2 and the alternation constraints involving event1) does not contradict or invalidate any above tautologies; it is irrelevant to the truth of the tautological statements used in C1–C7.

Final answer:

---
Goal: decide whether C7 is True or False.

Step-by-step:

- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautological implication and is true in every state.
- C2: same as C1, so true in every state.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is true in every state, C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event2 happens."" Because C3 is true, C4 is true in every state.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" Since C4 holds in every state, it holds in the next state as well, so C5 is true in every state.
- C6: ""C1 holds and C5 holds."" Both conjuncts hold in every state, so C6 holds in every state.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" Because C6 holds in every state, C7 is true.

The initial alternation of events does not falsify any of these tautological/always claims.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
You are asked whether C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true given the context and the listed conditions.

Step 2 — interpret each condition
- C1: (event2 → event2). This is a tautology (p → p), true in every state.
- C2: same as C1, also a tautology, true in every state.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is a tautology, it holds in every state, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event2 happens."" C3 is true, so C4 is true (true ∨ anything = true) in every state.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" Because C4 is true in every state, it is true in the next state as well, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""C1 holds and C5 holds."" Both components are true, so C6 is true in the current state.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" C6 is built from universally true pieces (C1 and C5 hold in every state), so C6 holds in every state; thus C7 is true.

Goal: decide whether C7 (""Event2 happens and C6 holds"") is true.

Step-by-step reasoning

1. From the context: initially event2 happened. Also after event2 no other events can happen — so the initial state is terminal (there is no next state).

2. Evaluate C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This contradicts the context (event2 did happen), so C1 is false.

3. Evaluate C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Event1 does not happen (there is only event2 initially and no further events), so the antecedent is false and the implication is vacuously true. Thus C2 is true.

4. Evaluate C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 already holds in the initial state, it is true that C2 holds eventually. So C3 is true.

5. Evaluate C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" There is no next state (after event2 no other events can happen), so C3 cannot hold in a next state. Therefore C4 is false.

6. C5 (""C4 always holds"") and C6 (""C5 always holds"") both require C4 to hold; since C4 is false, C5 and C6 are false.

7. C7 is ""Event2 happens and C6 holds."" Event2 does happen, but C6 is false, so the conjunction is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C7 (""Event2 happens and C6 holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
So from the initial state event2 has occurred and no further states/transitions (no next state) follow.

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This contradicts the context (event2 did happen initially). So C1 is False.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Event1 does not happen (because event2 already happened and no other events can happen). An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true, so C2 is True.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 already holds now, so C3 is True.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" There is no next state (event2 was terminal), so C4 is False (next-state requirement cannot be satisfied).
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" Since C4 is false now, it does not hold always; C5 is False.
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" C5 is already false, so C6 is False.
- C7: ""Event2 happens and C6 holds."" Event2 happens (True) but C6 is False, so the conjunction is False.

Final answer
False
---
We are asked whether C7 is true or false.

1) From the context: initially event2 happened. Also, after event2 no other events can happen. Therefore event1 never happens (there is no time at which event1 occurs).

2) C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is false (event2 did happen initially).

3) C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Because event1 never happens, the antecedent is always false, so C2 is vacuously true in every state.

4) C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 already holds immediately, C3 holds.

5) C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" C2 and hence C3 hold in every state (no event1 ever occurs), so C3 holds in the next state; C4 holds.

6) C5 and C6: ""C4 always holds"" and ""C5 always holds"" follow from the fact that C4 holds in every state; thus C5 and C6 hold.

7) C7: ""Event2 happens and C6 holds."" Event2 did happen (initially) and we have shown C6 holds, so C7 is true.

Final answer:
True"

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C5 (""If C3 holds, then C4 holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → event2 does happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant for these conditions).

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is false because context requires event2 to happen.
- C2: same as C1 → false.
- C3: C1 and C2 → false and false = false.
- C4: C1 and C2 → false.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" This is a material implication. An implication with a false antecedent (C3 is false) is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Event1 happened initially.
- After event1, event2 must happen → event2 does happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Given the context, this is false.
- C2: same as C1, so false.
- C3: ""C1 holds and C2 holds."" False ∧ False = false.
- C4: same as C3, so false.

Step 3 — evaluate C5:
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" This is an implication C3 → C4.
- Since C3 is false, the implication is true (a false antecedent makes the implication true in classical logic).

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- C5 is the statement ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds"" (i.e. C3 → C4).

Step 2 — examine each condition:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""Event2 does not happen."" (same as C1)
- C3: C1 and C2, i.e. ""Event2 does not happen and Event2 does not happen"" — equivalent to ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C4: same as C3 (equivalent to ""Event2 does not happen"").

Step 3 — use the context to evaluate truth of C1–C4:
- Context: event1 happened, and after event1 event2 must happen. So event2 does happen.
- Therefore C1 and C2 are false, and hence C3 and C4 are false.

Step 4 — evaluate C5 (C3 → C4):
- In classical logic an implication with a false antecedent is true.
- Also C3 and C4 are equivalent statements, so C3 → C4 is logically valid.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step-by-step reasoning:

1. From the context, event1 happened initially. So ""event1 happens"" is true.
2. The context says ""After event1, event2 must happen."" Since event1 happened, event2 will (eventually) happen. So ""event2 happens"" is true.
3. Given both events happen, C1 (""event2 happens and event1 happens"") is true.
4. C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is true because C1 does hold (at the time event2 occurs).
5. C3 is the same as C2, so C3 is also true.
6. C4 (""If C3 holds, then event1 happens"") is true because C3 holds and event1 does happen.
7. C5 (""If C2 holds, then C4 holds"") is true because C2 holds and C4 holds.
8. C6 is ""C5 holds or event2 happens"". Both disjuncts are true, so C6 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — What is asked
- We must decide whether C6 (""C5 holds or event2 happens"") is true given the context and the conditions C1–C5.

Step 2 — Use the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → event2 will occur (sometime after the initial moment).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Thus both event1 and event2 do occur in the run (event1 at the start, event2 later).

Step 3 — Evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" True (both events occur).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 is true in the run (both events occur), C1 will be true at the appropriate time — so C2 holds.
- C3: same as C2, so C3 holds.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event1 happens."" C3 does hold and event1 does happen, so C4 holds.
- C5: ""If C2 holds, then C4 holds."" C2 holds and C4 holds, so C5 holds.

Step 4 — Conclude about C6
- C6 is ""C5 holds or event2 happens."" We have already that C5 holds (and separately event2 also happens), so the disjunction is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Plan: identify what’s asked, evaluate each Ci using the given context, then conclude.

1) What’s asked
- Determine the truth of C6 given:
  - Initially event1 happened.
  - After event1, event2 must happen.
  - After event2, no other events can happen.
- C6 = (C5 holds) or (event2 happens).

2) Trace the events from the context
- event1 occurs initially.
- By “after event1, event2 must happen,” event2 will occur at some later point.
- By “after event2, no other events can happen,” event2 is terminal.
- So the execution contains event1 then (eventually) event2.

3) Evaluate the conditions
- C1: “Event2 happens and event1 happens.” Both occur in the execution, so C1 is true.
- C2: “C1 eventually holds.” Since event2 eventually happens (making C1 true at that time), C1 does eventually hold, so C2 is true.
- C3: same as C2, so C3 is true.
- C4: “If C3 holds, then event1 happens.” C3 does hold and event1 did happen, so C4 is true.
- C5: “If C2 holds, then C4 holds.” C2 holds and C4 holds, so C5 is true.
- C6: “C5 holds or event2 happens.” Both disjuncts are true (C5 is true and event2 happens), so C6 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
C6 is the statement ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds."" We must decide whether that implication is true given the definitions of C1–C5.

Step 2 — restate the conditions
- C1: Event2 happens or event1 happens.
- C2: C1 always holds. (i.e. ""always C1"")
- C3: C2 holds and event1 happens. (i.e. ""always C1"" ∧ ""event1"")
- C4: C3 always holds. (i.e. always(C3) = always( C2 ∧ event1 ))
- C5: C1 always holds. (same as C2)

Note: C2 and C5 are the same proposition.

Step 3 — reason about the implication C4 → C5
C4 asserts that at every time C3 holds; C3 includes C2 (which is ""C1 always holds""). So if C4 holds then at every time C2 holds — in particular C2 holds (and since C5 = C2, C5 holds). Therefore C4 entails C5.

Step 4 — conclusion
The implication C4 → C5 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C6 states: ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds"" (C4 → C5). We must decide whether that implication is true given the definitions.

Step 2 — expand the conditions
- C1: event2 ∨ event1.
- C2: always(C1) i.e. always(event1 ∨ event2).
- C3: C2 ∧ event1.
- C4: always(C3) i.e. always(C2 ∧ event1).
- C5: C1 always holds — this is the same as C2 (always(event1 ∨ event2)).
- C6: C4 → C5.

Step 3 — logical reasoning
- From C4 = always(C2 ∧ event1) we get always(C2) (because always(A ∧ B) implies always(A)).
- always(C2) is exactly C5 (since C5 = always(C1) and C2 = always(C1)).
- Therefore C4 implies C5.

Step 4 — conclusion
- The implication C4 → C5 is valid (and true). Even if C4 never actually holds, the implication is still true (false antecedent implies true implication), but here it also follows logically when C4 holds.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C6 (""If C4 holds, then C5 holds"") is true or false given the listed conditions.

Step 2 — unpack the conditions
- C1: event2 happens or event1 happens.
- C2: C1 always holds. (C2 ≡ ""always C1"")
- C3: C2 holds and event1 happens. (C3 ≡ ""always C1"" ∧ ""event1 happens"")
- C4: C3 always holds. (C4 ≡ ""always C3"")
- C5: C1 always holds. (C5 ≡ ""always C1"") — note C5 is the same statement as C2.
- C6: If C4 holds, then C5 holds. (C6 ≡ C4 → C5)

Step 3 — logical reasoning
- C3 contains C2 (since C3 = C2 ∧ event1). So whenever C3 is true, C2 is true.
- If C4 holds (C3 always holds), then at every time C3 is true, hence C2 is true (and thus ""always C1"" holds).
- Since C5 is exactly ""always C1"" (same as C2), C4 implies C5. Therefore C6 (C4 → C5) is true in all models.

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning step-by-step:
- From the context ""After event1, event2 must happen"" we get C1 (If event1 happens, then event2 happens). So C1 is true.
- C2 states ""C1 always holds."" Given the context makes C1 a law, C2 is true.
- C3 is ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is true, C3 is false.
- C4 is ""Event1 happens and C3 holds."" Because C3 is false, C4 is false.
- C5 is ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is false, C5 is true.
- C6 repeats C1, so C6 is true.
- C7 is ""If C5 holds, then C6 holds."" The antecedent C5 is true and the consequent C6 is true, so the implication C7 is true.

Therefore C7 is True.
---
True

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. From the context:
   - event1 happens (initially).
   - After event1, event2 must happen. That makes the implication ""if event1 happens, then event2 happens"" true.
   - After event2, no other events can happen (not directly needed here).

2. Evaluate the conditions:
   - C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" True (given by the context).
   - C2: ""C1 always holds."" True (the context gives the general rule that after event1 event2 must happen).
   - C3: ""C2 does not hold."" False (since C2 is true).
   - C4: ""Event1 happens and C3 holds."" False (event1 is true but C3 is false, so the conjunction is false).
   - C5: ""C4 does not hold."" True (since C4 is false).
   - C6: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" True (same as C1).
   - C7: ""If C5 holds, then C6 holds."" Antecedent C5 is true and consequent C6 is true, so the implication is true.

Therefore C7 is True.
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
- We must determine whether C7 (""If C5 holds, then C6 holds"") is true given the context and the other Ci statements.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened (so ""event1 happens"" is true).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so the implication ""if event1 happens then event2 happens"" is true).
- After event2 no other events can happen (not needed for C7 but consistent).

Step 3 — evaluate the Ci statements
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This matches the context, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" The context gives C1 as a necessity, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is true, C3 is false.
- C4: ""Event1 happens and C3 holds."" Event1 is true but C3 is false, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is false, C5 is true.
- C6: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Same as C1, so C6 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C7
- C7 is ""If C5 holds, then C6 holds."" We have C5 = true and C6 = true, so the implication is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 has already happened.
- After event1 no other events can happen, so once event1 has happened the system is frozen and event2 can never occur.
- The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 never occurs.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition
- C1 (Event2 always happens): False, because event2 never occurs.
- C2 (Event2 always happens): False (same as C1).
- C3 (C2 does not hold): True, since C2 is false.
- C4 (C3 eventually holds): True — C3 already holds now, so “eventually C3” is satisfied.
- C5 (C4 always holds): True — C4 is true at all times (C3 is true at all times), so C4 always holds.
- C6 (C1 holds or C5 holds): True — C1 is false but C5 is true, so the disjunction is true.
- C7 (C6 always holds): True — C6 is true at all times (because C5 is always true), so C7 holds.

Final answer:
True
---
First identify the situations implied by the context:
- event1 happened initially.
- After event1, no other events can happen → no events (including event2) can occur at any later time.
- After event2, event1 must happen → irrelevant because event2 cannot occur (see above).

Now evaluate the conditions:

- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" False — event2 cannot happen at all because event1 already occurred and blocks any further events.
- C2: same as C1, so also False.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" True, since C2 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" True — C3 already holds initially, so it holds (hence eventually holds).
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" True — C3 is permanently true, so the statement ""C3 eventually holds"" is true at every time.
- C6: ""C1 holds or C5 holds."" True — C5 holds, so the disjunction holds.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" True — since C5 always holds, C6 (C1 or C5) holds at every time.

Therefore C7 is True.

We want to know whether C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true given the context and the listed conditions.

1) Interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened (so at time 0: event1 is true).
- After event1, no other events can happen — so at every time > 0 no events occur (neither event1 nor event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen — this is irrelevant because event2 never can occur given the previous two facts (event1 already happened initially and prevents any later events), so event2 never occurs.

Thus event2 never occurs at any time.

2) Evaluate the conditions step by step (with the model above)
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" False (event2 never occurs).
- C2: same as C1. False.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false, C3 is True.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 already holds at the start, so C4 is True.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" C4 is true at every time (because C3 is a permanent fact about C2), so C5 is True.
- C6: ""C1 holds or C5 holds."" C1 is false but C5 is true, so C6 is True.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" C6 is true (in fact always true), so C7 is True.

Sample responses:
We evaluate the Ci formulas over the system trace:
time 0: event2 true.
time 1: event1 true (event2 false).
time 2+: no events true.

Interpret operators as usual (G = always, X = next, F = eventually).

- C1 = G(event2). Is event2 true at all times ≥ t? No: event2 is only true at time 0 and false afterwards. So C1 is false at every time.
- C2 = X C1. Since C1 is false at every time, C2 is false at every time.
- C3 = G(C2). C2 never holds, so C3 is false everywhere.
- C4 = X C3. C3 is false everywhere, so C4 is false everywhere.
- C5 = F C4. C4 never holds, so C5 is false everywhere.
- C6 = not C5. Since C5 is false everywhere, C6 is true everywhere.
- C7 = F C6. Because C6 is true at every time, C7 (there exists some future time where C6 holds) is true.

Therefore C7 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is asked
We must decide whether C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is True or False given the context and the chain of conditions C1–C6.

Step 2 — interpret the context and timeline
- t0 (initial): event2 has happened.
- The context requires that after event2, event1 must happen → at t1 event1 occurs.
- After event1, no other events can happen → from t2 onward there are no events (and in particular no further event2).

So the actual timeline is: t0: event2, t1: event1, t2+: no events.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions on that timeline
- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" (globally). False, because event2 occurs at t0 but not at t1 and later.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (X C1). False, because C1 is false at t1.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" (G C2). False, since C2 is already false at t0.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" (X C3). False.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" (F C4). False, because C4 is false at all times in this timeline.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold"" (¬C5). True, because C5 is false.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds"" (F C6). True, because C6 already holds at t0, so it certainly holds at some (in fact the current) time.

Final answer
True

We model time as a sequence of states s0, s1, s2, ... with the events:
- s0 (initial): event2 is true, event1 false.
- s1: event1 is true, event2 false.
- s2, s3, ...: no events true (event1 is terminal).

Interpret the conditions with standard temporal operators:
- G φ = ""always φ""
- X φ = ""next φ""
- F φ = ""eventually φ""

Evaluate step by step at s0:

1. C1 = G(event2). False at s0 because event2 is false at s1.
2. C2 = X C1. This asks whether C1 holds at s1; since C1 is false at s1, C2 is false at s0.
3. C3 = G C2. False at s0 because C2 is false at s0 (and at s1).
4. C4 = X C3. This asks whether C3 holds at s1; C3 is false at s1, so C4 is false at s0.
5. C5 = F C4. Is there any future state where C4 holds? No — C4 is false at every state — so C5 is false at s0.
6. C6 = not C5. Since C5 is false, C6 is true at s0 (and in fact true at all states).
7. C7 = F C6. Since C6 is already true at s0, ""eventually C6"" is true (holds immediately).

Therefore C7 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- C1 = ""event1 does not happen"" = ¬E1.
- C2 = ""event1 happens or C1 holds"" = E1 ∨ ¬E1, which is a tautology (always true).
- C3 = ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens"" = (True) → E2, so C3 is equivalent to E2.
- C4 = ""C3 does not hold"" = ¬C3 = ¬E2.
- C5 = ""C4 does not hold"" = ¬(¬E2) = E2.
- C6 = ""C5 holds in the next state"" = next(E2).
- C7 = ""C6 holds or event1 happens"" = next(E2) ∨ E1.

From the context, initially E1 happened, and after E1 event2 must happen — so E1 is true now and event2 will occur (at least next). Therefore E1 is true (making C7 true immediately), and next(E2) is also true (making C6 true). Either way, C7 is True.
---

---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Context gives an initial state S0 where event1 happened. After that (in S1) event2 must happen, and after event2 no further events occur.
- Evaluate the conditions at S0 and S1 as needed:
  - C1 (""event1 does not happen"") is false at S0 because event1 happened there.
  - C2 (""event1 happens or C1"") is true at S0 (because event1 happens).
  - C3 (""if C2 holds, then event2 happens"") is false at S0 if interpreted as requiring event2 in the same state (C2 is true at S0 but event2 occurs in S1). So C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is true at S0, and C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is false at S0.
  - At S1, event2 does happen. C3 holds at S1 (the consequent is true), so C4 is false at S1 and C5 is true at S1.
  - C6 (""C5 holds in the next state"") is true at S0 because C5 holds in S1.
  - C7 (""C6 holds or event1 happens"") is therefore true at S0 (indeed event1 happens at S0, and C6 also holds).
- Thus C7 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Timeline of events (states s0, s1, s2, ...):
   - s0 (initial): event2 occurs.
   - After event2, event1 must happen → s1: event1 occurs.
   - After event1, event2 must happen → s2: event2 occurs.
   - And so on, alternating: s0: event2, s1: event1, s2: event2, s3: event1, ...

2. Interpretations:
   - C1 = (event2 and event2) which is equivalent to event2 at a state.
   - C2 = ¬C1 (i.e. event2 does not hold at that state).
   - C3 = C2 holds in the next state.
   - C4 = event1 holds and C3 holds (at the same state).
   - C5 = C4 holds in the next state.
   - C6 = ¬C5.
   - C7 = C6 holds in the next state.

3. Evaluate at s0:
   - C1 at s0: event2 is true → C1 true.
   - C2 at s0: ¬C1 → false.
   - C3 at s0: C2 holds at s1. At s1 event2 is false → C1 false → C2 true at s1. So C3 is true at s0.
   - C4 at s0: event1 ∧ C3: event1 is false at s0, so C4 false at s0.
   - C5 at s0: C4 holds at s1. At s1, C4 = event1 ∧ C3. event1 is true at s1 but C3 at s1 is false (because at s2 event2 holds so C2 is false at s2), so C4 false at s1; therefore C5 false at s0.
   - C6 at s0: ¬C5 → true.
   - C7 at s0: C6 holds at s1. At s1, C5 is false (as just noted), so C6 = ¬C5 is true at s1. Thus C7 is true at s0.

Therefore C7 is True.

Step 1 — identify the question
- We evaluate whether C7 holds in the initial state (time 0), given the context.

Step 2 — translate the context into a timeline
- E2(0) is true (initially event2 happened).
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"": if E2(t) then E1(t+1).
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"": if E1(t) then E2(t+1).
- From E2(0) we get the alternating sequence: E2 true at even times (0,2,4,...) and E1 true at odd times (1,3,5,...).

Step 3 — formalize the Cs at time 0
- C1(t) ≡ E2(t) (since ""event2 and event2"" is just E2).
- C2(t) ≡ ¬C1(t) ≡ ¬E2(t).
- C3(t) ≡ C2(t+1) ≡ ¬E2(t+1).
- C4(t) ≡ E1(t) ∧ C3(t) ≡ E1(t) ∧ ¬E2(t+1).
- C5(t) ≡ C4(t+1) ≡ E1(t+1) ∧ ¬E2(t+2).
- C6(t) ≡ ¬C5(t) ≡ ¬(E1(t+1) ∧ ¬E2(t+2)) ≡ ¬E1(t+1) ∨ E2(t+2).
- C7(t) ≡ C6(t+1) ≡ ¬E1(t+2) ∨ E2(t+3).

Evaluate at t = 0:
- E1(2) is false (event1 only at odd times).
- E2(3) is false (event2 only at even times).
- Thus C7(0) = ¬E1(2) ∨ E2(3) = true ∨ false = true.

Final answer:
True
---
We take states t0 (initial), t1 (next), t2 (next after that), … and assume “after” means the immediate next state. From the context:
- t0: event2 is true.
- After event2, event1 must happen ⇒ t1: event1 true.
- After event1, event2 must happen ⇒ t2: event2 true.
So the pattern is event2 (t0), event1 (t1), event2 (t2), ...

Evaluate the Ci at t0 (unless otherwise noted, “holds in the next state” refers to the standard next-state operator):

- C1 (event2 and event2) at t0: true (t0 has event2).
- C2 (not C1) at t0: false.
- C3 (C2 holds in the next state) at t0 means C2 at t1. At t1 event2 is false, so C1 at t1 is false and C2 at t1 is true. Thus C3 at t0: true.
- C4 (event1 and C3) at t0: event1 at t0 is false, so C4 at t0: false.
- C5 (C4 holds in the next state) at t0 means C4 at t1. At t1 event1 is true but C3 at t1 is false (since at t2 event2 is true making C1 true and C2 false at t2), so C4 at t1 is false ⇒ C5 at t0: false.
- C6 (not C5) at t0: true (since C5 at t0 is false).
- C7 (C6 holds in the next state) at t0 means C6 at t1. We compute C5 at t1 equals C4 at t2; at t2 event1 is false so C4 at t2 is false, hence C5 at t1 false and C6 at t1 true. Therefore C7 at t0: true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds."" and C4 = ""C1 eventually holds."" — C2 and C4 are the same statement.

(The given context makes event2 impossible, so C1 is false, but that doesn't matter because C5 is already true, so C6 is true.)
---
You ask whether C6 (""Event2 happens or C5 holds"") is true given the context. Step-by-step:

- Context: Initially event1 happened. After event1, no other events can happen. Therefore no further events (including event2) can ever occur. The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never occurs.

- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" False (event2 never happens).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" False (C1 is never true).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" True (C2 is false).
- C4: ""C1 eventually holds."" Same as C2, so False.
- C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" True (C3 is true).
- C6: ""Event2 happens or C5 holds."" Since event2 does not happen but C5 is true, the disjunction is true.

Final answer: True.
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 has already happened.
- After event1 no other events can happen → once event1 has happened, the future has no further events.
- After event2, event1 must happen → if event2 ever happens, event1 must occur after it. But event1 already happened initially, and nothing can happen after it, so event2 cannot occur at any time.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" False (event2 cannot happen).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" This means at some future point C1 becomes true. Since event2 can never occur, C1 will never become true, so C2 is False.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is False, C3 is True.
- C4: ""C1 eventually holds."" (same as C2/C1-eventuality) False.
- C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" C3 is True, so C5 is True.
- C6: ""Event2 happens or C5 holds."" Event2 does not happen, but C5 holds, so C6 is True.

Step 1 — what is asked
- C7 is the implication: If C1 holds then C6 holds (C1 -> C6).

Step 2 — evaluate each Ci from the context
- Context: initially event2 happened. After event2, event1 must happen next; after event1, event2 must happen next. So the next state after the initial state is event1 (not event2).
- C1–C4: each asserts ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Since the next state is event1, C1–C4 are false.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" C3 is false, so the implication C5 is true (false implies anything).
- C6: ""C2 holds and C5 holds."" C2 is false and C5 is true, so C6 is false (false AND true = false).

Step 3 — evaluate C7
- C7 is ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds."" C1 is false, so the implication is true (false implies anything).

Final answer: True

Reasoning:

- Context: initially event2 happens. After event2, event1 must happen; after event1, event2 must happen. So the events alternate starting with event2: initial state = event2, next state = event1, following state = event2, etc.
- C1–C4: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Given the alternation, the next state after the initial event2 is event1, so C1–C4 are false.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" Since C3 is false, the implication is vacuously true, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""C2 holds and C5 holds."" C2 is false and C5 is true, so C6 is false.
- C7: ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds."" C1 is false, so the implication is vacuously true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning, step by step:

- Initially event1 has happened. The context says that after event1 no other events can happen, so the run is terminal (there is no future event).
- C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is false — event2 can never happen.
- C2 (not C1) is therefore true in the initial state.
- Since event2 can never happen at any point, C2 holds at every point on the run, so C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true. C4 is just a repeat of C2 and is true.
- Hence C5 (C3 or C4) is true in the initial state.
- C6 asserts that C5 holds in the next state. But there is no next state (no further events or successor state after event1), so the ""next"" requirement is not satisfied; therefore C6 is false.

Thus C6 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide the truth of C6: ""C5 holds in the next state.""

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So once the initial state has event1, there are no further events or transitions (no next state).
- Because no further events can occur, event2 can never happen in any future state.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" — False (event2 can never occur).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" — True.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" — True (at every point there is no possibility of event2, so ¬C1 holds always).
- C4: ""C1 does not hold."" — True (same as C2).
- C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" — True.

Step 4 — evaluate C6
- C6 asserts that C5 holds in the next state.
- But there is no next state (after event1 no other events / transitions can happen). In standard temporal semantics Xφ is false at a state with no successor.
- Therefore C6 is False.

Final answer: False
---
True

Reasoning, step by step:

- Context: initially event1 has happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. So once we are in the initial state, event2 can never occur in the future.

- C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is therefore false.

- C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true (it just says event2 does not eventually happen). C4 is the same as C2, so it is also true.

- C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true because at every future state (there are no event-producing transitions after event1) it remains true that event2 will never happen.

- C5 (""C3 holds or C4 holds"") is thus true (indeed both disjuncts are true).

- C6 (""C5 holds in the next state""): in the next state (and every subsequent state), the situation is unchanged — event2 cannot occur, so C5 still holds there. Hence C6 is true."

Identify the question
- We must decide whether C6 (""C5 eventually holds"") is true given the context.

Understand the context
- Initially (time t0) event2 occurred.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so at t1 event1).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so at t2 event2), and so on. Thus events alternate: t0: event2, t1: event1, t2: event2, t3: event1, ...

Examine the conditions at t0 (initial state)
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state (t1)"". At t1 we have event1, so C1 is false at t0.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" As a logical implication, since C1 is false at t0, C2 is vacuously true at t0.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state (t1)"". We must check C2 at t1:
  - At t1, C1 (relative to t1) says ""event2 happens at t2"" — that is true because events alternate.
  - At t1, event1 indeed happens (the consequent), so the implication C2 is true at t1.
  - Therefore C3 is true at t0 (because C2 holds at t1).
- C4: identical to C2, so C4 is true at t0.
- C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds"" — since both C3 and C4 are true at t0, C5 is true at t0.
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds"" — because C5 already holds at t0, C6 is true.

Conclusion
- True

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 (and after event2) no other events can happen. Therefore event2 does not occur at any time.
- C1 (""event1 or event2 happens"") is true (event1 happened).
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") is not needed for the final step, but note C3 (""C2 holds and event2 happens"") requires event2 and thus is false.
- Hence C4 (""C3 always holds"") is false, and C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is false (there is no future change that would make C4 true).
- C6 (""If C5 holds, then event2 happens"") is a material implication with a false antecedent (C5 is false), so C6 is true.
- C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is satisfied because C6 already holds now (so it holds at some time), hence C7 is true.

Answer: True

Step-by-step reasoning

1. From the context the only actual event that happens is event1 initially, and after that no events ever occur. So the timeline is: at time 0 event1 holds; at all later times neither event1 nor event2 holds.

2. Evaluate the conditions (using standard temporal reading: ""always"" = globally G, ""eventually"" = finally F, and atomic ""eventX"" is true only at the states where that event occurs):

- C1 = (event1 ∨ event2). True at time 0 (because event1 happened), false at all later times.
- C2 = G C1. False, because C1 does not hold at later times.
- C3 = C2 ∧ event2. False (C2 is false and event2 never occurs).
- C4 = G C3. False (C3 is false now and hence not true globally).
- C5 = F C4. False (C4 never becomes true).
- C6 = (C5 → event2). Since C5 is false at every time, the implication is vacuously true at every time. Thus C6 holds now (and in fact always).
- C7 = F C6. Because C6 already holds now, ""eventually C6"" is true.

3. Therefore C7 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answering: C6 is False.

Reasoning, step by step:

- The question asks whether C6 (Event1 happens and C5 holds) is true or false.

- From the context: initially event1 happened. The rules force event2 to happen after any event1, and event1 to happen after any event2. So event2 does happen (after the initial event1), and event1 does happen (initially and again after event2). In particular, ""Event1 happens"" is true, so C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is false.

- C2 and C3 both say ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" But event2 does happen and C1 is false, so those conditionals are false.

- C4 says ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 is already false and cannot become true (since event2 does occur and C1 is already false), so C4 is false.

- C5 is ""C2 holds or C4 holds"" — both are false, so C5 is false.

- C6 is ""Event1 happens and C5 holds"": true AND false = false.

Therefore C6 is False.
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
- We must decide whether C6 (""Event1 happens and C5 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — use the context
- Context: initially event1 happened, and thereafter event2 must happen; after event2, event1 must happen. So event1 does happen (at least initially and repeatedly), and event2 also does occur (after event1).

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This contradicts the context (event1 does happen). Therefore C1 is false.
- C2 and C3: both are ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Since event2 does happen (by the context) and C1 is false, these implications are false. (When the antecedent happens and the consequent is false, the implication is false.)
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 is false whenever event2 occurs; because event2 does occur repeatedly, C3 does not become true in the relevant points, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C2 holds or C4 holds."" Both C2 and C4 are false, so C5 is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C6
- C6 = ""Event1 happens and C5 holds."" Although ""Event1 happens"" is true, C5 is false, so the conjunction C6 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context: event1 happens initially. Also, after event1, event2 must happen; and after event2, event1 must happen. So event2 will occur (after the initial event1), and event1 will occur again (after event2). In short, event1 does happen (at least initially).

2. Evaluate C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This contradicts the context, so C1 is false.

3. C2 and C3: each says ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"" (i.e., event2 ⇒ not event1). But event2 does happen (by the context), and C1 is false. Therefore both C2 and C3 are false.

4. C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Since C3 is false and there is nothing in the context that would make C3 true at any later time (event2 will occur and that makes C3 false), C4 is false.

5. C5: ""C2 holds or C4 holds."" Both are false, so C5 is false.

6. C6: ""Event1 happens and C5 holds."" Although ""Event1 happens"" is true, C5 is false, so the conjunction is false.

Therefore C6 is False."

Sample responses:
Identify the question
- We must decide whether C7 (""If C1 holds, then C6 holds"") is True or False given the context and the other conditions.

Understand the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- Hence event2 does occur (initially), and by the rules event1 and event2 will alternate, so event2 indeed happens.

Evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" False (event2 does happen).
- C2: ""Event2 does not happen."" False.
- C3: ""Event2 does not happen."" False.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" True, because C3 is false.
- C5: ""C2 holds or C4 holds."" False or True = True.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" False, because C5 is true.
- C7: ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds."" This is an implication C1 → C6. Since C1 is false, the implication is true (a false antecedent makes the implication true).

Final answer
True
---
Answer: True

Brief justification (concise):

- From the context, event2 does happen (it happened initially), so C1, C2, C3 are all false.
- C4 says ""C3 does not hold"" — since C3 is false, C4 is true.
- C5 = (C2 or C4) — C2 is false but C4 is true, so C5 is true.
- C6 says ""C5 does not hold"" — since C5 is true, C6 is false.
- C7 is the implication ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds."" An implication with a false antecedent (C1 is false) is true.

Therefore C7 is True.
---
You are asking whether C7 (""If C1 holds, then C6 holds"") is true or false.

Evaluate the conditions given the background:
- Initially event2 happened, and event1 ↔ event2 forces alternation, so event2 does happen. Therefore:
  - C1 (event2 does not happen) is false.
  - C2 (same) is false.
  - C3 (same) is false.
- C4 is ""C3 does not hold"" — since C3 is false, C4 is true.
- C5 is ""C2 holds or C4 holds"" — C2 is false but C4 is true, so C5 is true.
- C6 is ""C5 does not hold"" — since C5 is true, C6 is false.

Now C7 is the implication ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds."" The antecedent C1 is false, so the implication is true (a false antecedent makes the implication true in standard logic).

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event2 has occurred.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So no event (including event1) can occur at any time after the initial moment.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event1 cannot occur (it would have to occur before event2, but we start with event2 already happened).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1 / C2: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Given event2 already occurred and no further events can happen, event1 cannot happen at any time. So C1 and C2 are false.
- event2 happens: true (it happened initially).
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens"" — since C2 is false, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" — C3 is false now and cannot become true later (no events can change anything), so C4 is false.
- C5: ""Event1 happens and C4 holds"" — false (both parts false).
- C6: ""If C1 holds, then C5 holds"" — an implication with a false antecedent (C1 is false), so C6 is vacuously true.
- C7: ""C6 always holds"" — C6 is true now and will remain true (nothing can change it, since no events can occur). Thus C6 does hold at all times.

Final answer
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C7 (""C6 always holds"") is True or False under the given context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 happened (so event2 has already occurred).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so no events occur after that initial event2).
- The rule ""After event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event1 never occurs in any allowed trace (nothing can happen after the initial event2).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions on the single possible trace
- The only possible trace consistent with the context is: event2 at the initial moment, and then nothing else.
- C1 (event1 eventually happens): false (event1 never occurs).
- C2 is the same as C1: false.
- C3 (C2 holds and event2 happens): false, because C2 is false (though event2 did happen).
- C4 (C3 eventually holds): false (C3 never holds).
- C5 (event1 happens and C4 holds): false.
- C6 (if C1 holds, then C5 holds): This implication is true, because the antecedent C1 is false — the implication is vacuously true.
- C7 (""C6 always holds""): since C6 is true in the only possible trace (and at every time point there is no change that could make C1 true), C6 holds at all times. Therefore C7 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must determine whether C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true given the context and the other conditions. The final answer must be either ""True"" or ""False"".

Step 2 — restate the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
From ""initially event2 happened"" and ""after event2 no other events can happen"" it follows that no events (including event1) can occur at any time after the initial moment.

Step 3 — simplify the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Given the context, event1 cannot happen (event2 already happened and forbids further events), so C1 is false.
- C2 is the same as C1, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" event2 does happen (initially), but C2 is false, so C3 is false.
  (Note: since event2 happens initially, the conjunct with event2 does not make C3 true because C2 is false.)
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 is never true, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""Event1 happens and C4 holds."" Both parts are false, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""If C1 holds, then C5 holds."" This implication is vacuously true because C1 is false (an implication with a false antecedent is true).
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" Since C6 is true in the actual situation (and there are no alternative traces where C1 can become true because event1 can never occur), C6 holds at all times; therefore C7 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — What is asked:
We must determine whether C5 (which is ""C3 holds or C4 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — Examine the conditions:
- C1: Event1 happens in the next state.
- C2: Event1 happens in the next state. (same as C1)
- C3: C1 or C2 (so equivalent to C1)
- C4: C1 or C2 (same)
- C5: C3 or C4 (therefore equivalent to C1)

So C5 is true exactly when Event1 happens in the next state.

Step 3 — Use the context:
- ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 occurs in the initial state.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That means in the next state (after the initial), no events — including event1 — occur.
- The note about event2 is irrelevant here.

Step 4 — Conclusion:
Event1 does not happen in the next state, so C1 and C2 are false, hence C3, C4, and C5 are false.

Final answer: False
---
First identify the question: C5 is ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" Given C3 and C4 are each ""C1 holds or C2 holds,"" and C1 and C2 are both ""Event1 happens in the next state,"" C5 is equivalent to saying ""Event1 happens in the next state.""

Examine the context:
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 already occurred in the initial state).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so there are no further events after the initial occurrence of event1).

Trace the sequence:
- Since event1 already happened initially and no events can happen after event1, there is no next state in which an event (including event1) can occur.
- Therefore ""Event1 happens in the next state"" is false, so C1 and C2 are false, hence C3, C4, and C5 are all false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis:
- We are asked whether C5 is true, where
  - C1: event1 happens in the next state.
  - C2: event1 happens in the next state.
  - C3: C1 or C2.
  - C4: C1 or C2.
  - C5: C3 or C4.

Step 2 — understand the context:
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 has already occurred).
- After event1, no other events can happen. (No events occur after that point.)
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant since event2 did not occur).

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- Both C1 and C2 state that event1 happens in the next state.
- Because event1 already happened initially and no events can happen after event1, there cannot be an occurrence of event1 in the next state. So C1 is false, and C2 is false.

Step 4 — propagate to C3, C4, C5:
- C3 = C1 or C2 = false or false = false.
- C4 = C1 or C2 = false.
- C5 = C3 or C4 = false or false = false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:

Step 1 — what’s asked:
- The question asks whether C7 (""C6 always holds"") is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the conditions and simplify:
- C1, C3, C5 are the same formula: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens"" (call this P).
- C2 is ""C1 holds in the next state"" (call this N).
- C4 is N ∧ P.
- C6 is ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds"" i.e. (N ∧ P) → P.

Step 3 — logical reasoning:
- (N ∧ P) → P is a propositional tautology: whenever N ∧ P is true, P is already true, so the implication is true; when N ∧ P is false the implication is also true. Thus C6 is true in every state regardless of the context.
- Therefore C6 indeed ""always holds"", so C7 is true.
- (The background facts about event1 and event2 make P false in the initial state, but that does not affect the tautologous truth of C6.)

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C7 (""C6 always holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has occurred, there are no successor states with further events.)
- After event2, no other events can happen as well (not relevant because event2 does not occur here).

Step 3 — evaluate the named conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" In the actual (initial) state event1 does happen, and because no other events can happen after event1, event2 does not happen. So C1 is false in the initial state.
- C3 and C5 are the same formula as C1, so they are also false in the initial state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" There is no next state (no events can occur after event1), so C2 does not hold in any successor; however this detail is not needed for the next step.
- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds."" Since C3 is false, C4 is false regardless of C2.
- C6: ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds."" An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C6 is true in the current state (because C4 is false).
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" There are no future states (no transitions after the initial state), so the only state to check is the initial one where C6 holds. Therefore ""always"" (over all states of the run) is satisfied.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C7 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
First identify the question: we must decide whether C6 (C2 holds or C5 holds) is true given the context.

Reasoning through the conditions using the context:
- Context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 event2 must happen. So event2 does happen in the next state. Therefore C1 is true.
- C3 repeats C1, so C3 is true.
- C5 is ""C3 holds or C4 holds"". Because C3 is true, C5 is true (regardless of C4).
- C6 is ""C2 holds or C5 holds"". Since C5 is true, C6 is true (regardless of C2).

Therefore C6 is True.
---
True

Reasoning:
- From the context ""Initially, event1 happened"" and ""After event1, event2 must happen,"" event2 does indeed occur in the next state. So C1 (and C3, the same statement) is true.
- Event1 already happened initially, so any conditional ""If C1 then event1 happens"" (C2 and C4) is true — the consequent is true regardless of C1.
- Therefore C5 (C3 or C4) is true, and C2 is also true; hence C6 (C2 or C5) is true.
---
Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Goal: decide truth of C6 = (C2) or (C5). Note C3 = C1 and C4 = C2, so C5 = C3 or C4 = C1 or C2. Hence C6 = C2 or (C1 or C2) = C1 or C2.
- From the context, event1 happened initially. Also “after event1, event2 must happen,” so event2 does occur (in particular in the next state in the usual reading), so C1 is true.
- Even without using C1, C2 (“If C1 holds, then event1 happens”) is true because event1 already happened initially, so the implication holds.
- Since C2 is true, C6 = (C1 or C2) is true.

Therefore C6 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C7 is ""C6 eventually holds"" (an eventuality about the Ci). We must decide whether C7 is true given the event constraints.

Step 2 — translate and simplify the Ci
- Let E1 mean ""event1 happens in the current state"".
- C1: ¬E1.
- C2: ¬C1 = ¬(¬E1) = E1.
- C3: ¬C2 = ¬(E1) = ¬E1. So C3 is identical to C1.
- C4: X C3 (C3 in the next state).
- C5: G C4 (C4 always holds).
- C6: ¬C5.
- C7: F C6 (eventually C6).

Step 3 — simplify C7
- C5 is G(X¬E1). So C6 = ¬G(X¬E1), and C7 = F(¬G(X¬E1)).
- ¬G(X¬E1) means ""there is some state whose next state does not satisfy ¬E1"" — i.e., there exists a state whose next state has E1 true.
- Therefore C7 holds exactly when there exists some state in the run where E1 is true.

Step 4 — use the context
- Initially event2 happens, and after event2 event1 must happen. So event1 does occur (at least once, e.g. in the next state after the initial one). Hence there exists a state with E1 true.

Conclusion
- Since E1 occurs at some state, C7 is true.

True

Sample responses:
First identify the question: C5 is ""C3 holds or C4 holds"" — we must decide if C5 is True or False given the context.

Reasoning through the context and each condition:

- Context facts:
  - Initially event2 happened.
  - After event1, event2 must happen.
  - After event2, no other events can happen.

- Consequences for events:
  - Since event2 already happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, event1 cannot happen at any time (it cannot be before the initial event2, and it cannot be after it).
  - Therefore ""Event1 happens and event2 happens"" (C1) is false (event1 does not happen).
  - C2 = ""C1 does not hold"" is true.

- C3 and C4 both assert ""C2 always holds."" Because C1 is impossible under the given constraints, C2 is true and will remain true at all times; therefore C3 is true and C4 is true.

- C5 is ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" Since at least one (indeed both) of C3 and C4 hold, C5 is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — what C5 asks:
- C5 is ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" So we need to determine whether at least one of C3 or C4 is true.

Step 2 — interpret the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- If event1 happens, then event2 must happen afterward.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Because event2 has already happened initially and after event2 no events can happen, event1 cannot occur at any later time (and there is no earlier time before the initial state). So event1 does not happen at all.

Step 3 — examine the conditions:
- C1 (""Event1 happens and event2 happens""): false (event1 does not happen).
- C2 (""C1 does not hold""): true.
- C3 (""C2 always holds""): true — C1 can never become true given the context, so C2 holds in all reachable states.
- C4 is the same as C3, so it is also true.
- Therefore C5 (""C3 holds or C4 holds"") is true.

Final answer: True
---
The hypothesis asks whether C5 is true given the context.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Context: initially event2 happened. Also, after any event2, no other events can happen. Therefore no events can occur after the initial event2; in particular, event1 cannot occur at any time (there is no time after the initial event2 when it could occur).
- C1 = ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" Event2 does happen (initially) but event1 cannot happen, so C1 is false.
- C2 = ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- C3 = ""C2 always holds."" C2 is a global truth (C1 is false for the whole trace), so C3 holds. C4 is the same as C3, so it also holds.
- C5 = ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" At least one of them (in fact both) holds, so C5 is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — question
The hypothesis asks whether C7 (""C6 holds in the next state"") is true or false.

Step 2 — evaluate the atomic facts
From the context: initially event2 happened. So the proposition ""Event2 does not happen"" is false in the initial state (and, since it names the same fact, is false in any state where event2 happened).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1, C2, C3 are all the same proposition: ""Event2 does not happen"" (so they are false where event2 happened).
- C4 is ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" Since C2 and C3 are identical, C4 is true in every state (an implication p → p is always true).
- C5 is ""C1 holds or C4 holds."" Because C4 is always true, C5 is true in every state.
- C6 is ""C5 always holds."" Since C5 is true in every state, C6 is true (the universal/always claim holds).
- C7 is ""C6 holds in the next state."" But C6 is a global truth (true in every state), so it also holds in the next state.

Step 4 — conclusion
C7 is True.
---
Step 1 — model the scenario
- Let S0 be the initial state. In S0, event2 has happened.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" means there is no successor state after S0 (no next state).
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant because event1 did not occur.

Step 2 — evaluate C1–C5 in S0
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" — false in S0 (event2 did happen).
- C2: same as C1 — false.
- C3: same — false.
- C4: ""If C2 holds then C3 holds"" — true in S0, because the antecedent C2 is false (false implies anything).
- C5: ""C1 holds or C4 holds"" — false or true = true in S0.

Step 3 — C6 in S0
- C6: ""C5 always holds"" — since there are no future states beyond S0, C5 holds at every state on the (trivial) trace, so C6 is true in S0.

Step 4 — C7
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state"" — there is no next state after S0, so the ""next"" requirement fails. Under the usual semantics where Xφ is false if there is no successor, C7 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event2 happened, so the proposition ""Event2 does not happen"" (C1, C2, C3) is false.
- C4: ""If C2 holds then C3 holds"" is true (an implication with a false antecedent is true).
- C5 = C1 or C4 is therefore true (false or true).
- C6: ""C5 always holds"" is true (C5 is true now and there are no ways to make it false).
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state"" requires that a next state exists. But the context says that after event2 no other events can happen, so there is no next state. Under standard temporal semantics, ""holds in the next state"" is false when there is no next state. Hence C7 is false."

Answer: False

Step-by-step reasoning

1) What the hypothesis asks
- C6 is ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" So C6 is true exactly when both C4 and C5 are true.

2) Meaning of the atomic statements (natural reading)
- ""Event1 always happens"" (C1, C5): reads as a universal property that event1 occurs at all times / in every state of the execution.
- ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2, C3): reads as there is some time in the future where the statement C1 (Event1 always happens) is true.
(If you use different formal meanings of ""always"" / ""eventually"", the same structure below applies: C6 requires C5 to be true.)

3) What the context forces about possible executions
- Initially event1 happened (so event1 occurs at the initial point).
- After event1, no other events can happen. Therefore no further events (including a repeated event2) can occur after that initial occurrence.

4) Evaluate the conditions
- C5 (""Event1 always happens"") is false under the natural reading: event1 occurred at the initial moment but does not occur at all subsequent times (there are no further events), so it is not true that event1 happens at every time/state.
- Because C5 is false, C6 = C4 AND C5 cannot be true regardless of C4.

5) Conclusion
- C6 is False.
---
True

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Initially event1 happened (so event1 holds at the initial time).
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means once event1 has occurred the system produces no further events — nothing can change afterwards. Since event1 holds at the initial time and no event can occur to change that, event1 remains true at every future time point.
- Therefore C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is true.
- If C1 is true now, ""C1 eventually holds"" (C2 and C3) is trivially true (it holds immediately and hence eventually).
- C4 (C2 and C3) is true, and C5 is the same as C1 so it is true.
- Thus C6 (C4 and C5) is true."

Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C6 (""C5 eventually holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret context
- Initially event2 happened. After event2 no other events can happen, so event1 never occurs (it cannot happen before the initial event2 either, since event2 is initial).
- Also there is a rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"", but that is irrelevant because event1 never occurs.

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p), so C1 is true at all times.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is a tautology, it indeed always holds, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C1 always holds."" Same as C2, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" C3 is true, so C4 is true (regardless of event1).
- C5: ""C2 holds and C4 holds."" Both are true, so C5 is true now (indeed always).
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" Since C5 already holds (right now and always), it certainly holds at some time in the future — so C6 is true.

Final answer:
True

The hypothesis asks whether C6 (""C5 eventually holds"") is true given the context.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. From the context, event2 happened initially and no events can happen after that, so event1 never occurs (there is no time at which event1 happens).
2. C1 is ""if event1 happens, then event1 happens"" — this is a tautology (always true regardless of whether event1 ever occurs). So C1 holds.
3. C2 and C3 state that C1 always holds. Since C1 is a tautology, C2 and C3 are true.
4. C4 is ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" C3 holds, so C4 is true (no need for event1).
5. C5 is ""C2 holds and C4 holds."" Both are true, so C5 is true.
6. C6 is ""C5 eventually holds."" Because C5 already holds (indeed it holds always), it certainly holds at some time — thus ""eventually C5"" is true.

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — interpret each condition:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (always true).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is a tautology, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C1 always holds."" Same as C2, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" C3 holds, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C2 holds and C4 holds."" Both are true, so C5 is true now.
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" If C5 holds now, then it certainly holds eventually.

Step 2 — effect of the event constraints:
The facts about event2 being initially happened and no further events after event2 do not contradict any of the above logical truths (they impose constraints on possible event sequences, but all Ci here are satisfied immediately and do not require future events).

Conclusion:
C6 is True."

Sample responses:
C7 is the formula (C1 -> C6). We check whether that implication must hold under the given constraints.

1. From the context the system is forced to alternate:
   - s0 (initial): event1.
   - s1: event2 (because after event1, event2 must happen).
   - s2: event1 (because after event2, event1 must happen).
   - s3: event2, etc.

2. Interpret the Ci:
   - C1 = Next(event1).
   - C2 = Next(event1) (same as C1).
   - C3 = event2 OR Next(event1).
   - C4 = event1 AND C3 = event1 AND (event2 OR Next(event1)).
   - C5 = Globally(C4).
   - C6 = Next(Globally(C4)).
   - C7 = C1 -> C6.

3. Find a counterexample state:
   - At s1: Next(event1) is true (s2 has event1), so C1 holds at s1.
   - C4 at s2 is false: s2 has event1 but neither event2 holds at s2 nor Next(event1) (s3 is event2), so C4 false at s2.
   - Therefore Globally(C4) is false (since it already fails at s2), so C6 = Next(Globally(C4)) is false at s1.
   - Thus at s1 we have C1 true and C6 false, so the implication C1 -> C6 is false.

Therefore C7 is False.
---

Answer: True

Reasoning (step by step):

- From the context: initially event1 happened. The rules say after any event1 the next state must have event2, and after any event2 the next state must have event1. So the system enforces strict alternation: event1, event2, event1, ...

- C1 and C2 both assert ""event1 happens in the next state"" (i.e. immediately after the initial state). Given the alternation and the initial event1, the next state must be event2, so C1 (and C2) is false.

- C3 is ""event2 or C2"". Since event2 does happen in the next state, C3 is true at that next state. C4 is ""event1 and C3"", which therefore is false at that next state (because event1 is false there). C5 (""C4 always holds"") is false (C4 does not hold at every state). Hence C6 (""C5 holds in the next state"") is false.

- C7 is the implication ""if C1 then C6"". An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously). Since C1 is impossible under the context, C7 is true in every model of the context.

Therefore C7 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The question asks whether the implication C5 (""If C3 holds, then C4 holds"") is true.
- Look at C3 and C4: both are the same statement — ""C2 always holds.""
- An implication of the form P → P is always true (either because P is true, or because if P is false the implication is vacuously true).
- Therefore, regardless of the background event description, C3 implies C4 trivially, so C5 is True.
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
C5 is the statement ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" We must decide whether that implication is true given the definitions of C3 and C4.

Step 2 — examine C3 and C4
C3: ""C2 always holds.""
C4: ""C2 always holds.""

They are the same statement (identical content).

Step 3 — reason about the implication
An implication ""If A then B"" is true whenever A and B are the same proposition, because whenever A holds, B holds as well (they are identical). Thus ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds"" is necessarily true regardless of whether C3 (or C4) actually holds in the given event context.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — Identify what’s asked
- C5 is the statement: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" We must decide whether that implication is true given the context and the listed conditions.

Step 2 — Understand each condition
- C1: ""Event1 always happens.""
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (i.e., at some future point C1 is true)
- C3: ""C2 always holds.""
- C4: ""C2 always holds."" (same as C3)
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds.""

Step 3 — Note the relevant logical relation
- C3 and C4 are syntactically identical: both assert ""C2 always holds.""
- Therefore C5 has the form (A → A), where A is ""C2 always holds.""

Step 4 — Evaluate the implication
- Any proposition A implies itself (A → A) is a tautology (always true), regardless of the truth value of A or of the background context about events.

Answer: True

Reasoning (step by step):
- C1, C3 and C6 are the same statement (""Event1 always happens"").
- C2 is the negation of C1.
- C4 = C2 or C3 = (not C1) or C1, which is a logical tautology (always true).
- If C4 is always true, then C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true (it already holds initially).
- Therefore C7 = C5 or C6 is true (since C5 is true).

The context about event1 happening initially and being terminal does not change this conclusion: C4 is a tautology, so C7 is True.
---
Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. The question asks whether C7 is true given the context and the conditions C1–C6.

2. Note C2 is ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., ¬C1) and C3 is the same statement as C1. Thus
   C4 = C2 ∨ C3 = (¬C1) ∨ C1,
   which is a tautology (always true), regardless of whether C1 actually holds.

3. Since C4 is true now, ""C4 eventually holds"" (C5) is also true (it already holds immediately).

4. C7 is C5 ∨ C6. We have C5 true, so C7 is true (the truth of C6 is irrelevant).

Therefore C7 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the hypothesis structure
- Let S = ""Event1 always happens.""
- Then C1 = S, C2 = ¬S, C3 = S, C4 = C2 ∨ C3 = (¬S ∨ S), C5 = ""C4 eventually holds"", C6 = S, C7 = C5 ∨ C6.

Step 2 — simplify using propositional logic
- C4 = (¬S ∨ S) is a tautology (law of excluded middle), so C4 is true in every state/trace.
- If C4 is true now (and thus always), then ""C4 eventually holds"" (C5) is also true.
- Therefore C5 is true regardless of S.
- C7 = C5 ∨ C6 = True ∨ S = True.

Step 3 — relation to the context
- The given context (event1 happens initially; after event1 or event2 no other events can happen) does not affect the tautological reasoning above.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the background
- Initially event1 happened (so event1 is true in the initial state).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so in the next state event2 is true).
- After event2 no other events can happen.

Step 2 — evaluate C1–C3 in the initial state
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" Given the background, both events occur (event1 initially, event2 next), so C1 is true (true in the timeline; in the initial state we know both occur in the sequence).
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Since event1 does happen and C1 is true, the implication is true.
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" Both conjuncts are true in the initial state, so C3 is true there.

Step 3 — C4: C3 holds in the next state
- In the next state event2 happens but event1 does not (it already happened in the initial state). C3 requires ""event1 happens"" and ""C2 holds."" In the next state ""event1 happens"" is false, so C3 does not hold in the next state. Therefore C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is false.

Step 4 — C5–C7 by negations
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is false, C5 is true.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" Since C5 is true, C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" Since C6 is false, C7 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Context gives: at the initial state event1 happens; immediately after that event2 must happen; after event2 no further events occur.
- C1 = ""event1 and event2 happen."" Given the context, both occur (event1 initially, then event2), so C1 holds at/over the initial transition.
- C2 = ""if event1 happens then C1 holds."" That encodes the requirement that event2 follows event1; in the initial state where event1 happens, C2 holds.
- C3 = ""event1 happens and C2 holds."" That is true in the initial state.
- C4 = ""C3 holds in the next state."" The next state is the one where event2 happens and no other events occur, so event1 does not happen there. Since C3 requires event1 to happen in that state, C3 does not hold in the next state. Therefore C4 is false.
- C5 = ""C4 does not hold"" = not C4. Since C4 is false, C5 is true.
- C6 = ""C5 does not hold"" = not C5. Since C5 is true, C6 is false.
- C7 = ""C6 does not hold"" = not C6. Since C6 is false, C7 is true.

Thus C7 is True.
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- S0 (initial): event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → in the next state S1, event2 happens.
- After event2, no other events can happen → in S2 and later nothing happens.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" True (event1 in S0 and event2 in S1).
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" In the actual run event1 happens and C1 is true, so the implication is true (and would be vacuously true in states without event1).
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" C2 holds and event1 happens in S0, so C3 is true in S0.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" In S1 event1 does not hold (only event2 does), so C3 is false in S1. Therefore C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is false, C5 is true.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" C5 is true, so C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" C6 is false, so C7 is true.

Summary reasoning (concise, non-confidential):

- C1 and C2 both are just ""event1"". C3 = ¬C2, so C4 = ¬C3 = C2 = event1. C5 is the implication C1 → C4 which is event1 → event1, always true when evaluated in any state where C1 and C4 have their defined meanings.
- From the context: initially event1 holds. The rules ""after event1, event2 must happen"" and ""after event2, event1 must happen"" force an alternating sequence: t0: event1, t1: event2, t2: event1, ...
- Evaluate C5 at successive states: C5 is true at every state (either because C1 is false and the implication holds, or because both sides are true). Therefore C6 (""C5 holds in the next state"") is true at t0 (since C5 holds at t1), and C6 is true at t1 (since C5 holds at t2). Hence C7 (""C6 holds in the next state"") evaluated at t0 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
First: the hypothesis asks whether C7 is true given the context.

Interpretation / setup
- Time 0 (initial): event1 holds.
- Rules: after event1, event2 must hold (so at the next time step after an event1, event2 holds); after event2, event1 must hold. Thus the events alternate: time0: event1, time1: event2, time2: event1, time3: event2, ...

Rewrite the Ci in plain terms (at a given state):
- C1: event1.          (event1 ∨ event1 = event1)
- C2: event1.
- C3: not C2 = not event1.
- C4: not C3 = event1.
- C5: C1 -> C4, i.e. event1 -> event1 (which is true whenever evaluated).
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state"" = Next(C5).
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state"" = Next(C6) = Next(Next(C5)).

Evaluate by time steps
- Time 0:
  - event1 = true → C1 = true, C2 = true, C3 = false, C4 = true.
  - C5 = (true -> true) = true.
  - C6 = Next(C5): we must check C5 at time1.
- Time 1 (event2):
  - event1 = false → C1 = C2 = false, C3 = true, C4 = false.
  - C5 = (false -> false) = true (implication with false antecedent is true).
  - So C5 is true at time1 → C6 is true at time0.
  - C7 = Next(C6): we must check C6 at time1 (i.e. C5 at time2).
- Time 2 (event1):
  - event1 = true → same pattern as time0, so C5 is true at time2.
  - Thus C6 is true at time1, so C7 (Next(C6) at time0) is true.

Conclusion
C7 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must determine whether C7 is true in the initial state given the context and the conditions C1–C7.

Step 2 — interpret the context (timeline)
- s0 (initial): event1 happens.
- Rules: after event1, event2 must happen next; after event2, event1 must happen next.
- Hence the events alternate: s0: event1, s1: event2, s2: event1, s3: event2, …

Step 3 — interpret each condition at a generic state s
- C1(s): ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" ≡ event1(s).
- C2(s): same ≡ event1(s).
- C3(s): ""C2 does not hold"" ≡ ¬event1(s).
- C4(s): ""C3 does not hold"" ≡ ¬¬event1(s) ≡ event1(s).
- C5(s): ""If C1 holds, then C4 holds"" ≡ event1(s) → event1(s), which is a tautology and therefore true at every state.
- C6(s): ""C5 holds in the next state"" ≡ C5(next(s)). Since C5 is true at every state, C6(s) is true at every state.
- C7(s): ""C6 holds in the next state"" ≡ C6(next(s)). Since C6 is true at every state, C7(s) is true at every state.

Step 4 — conclusion
- In particular at the initial state, C7 is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
C6 asserts: ""If C2 holds, then C5 holds."" We must decide whether that implication is true given the scenario.

Step 2 — understand the statements
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so there is no next state after the initial state).
- C1: event2 or event1.
- C2: eventually C1 (i.e. C1 holds at some future—or present—state).
- C3: eventually C1 (same as C2).
- C4: C3 holds in the next state (X C3).
- C5: C4 always holds (G C4).
- C6: C2 → C5.

Step 3 — reason about traces
- In the initial state event1 is true, so C1 is true right away. Hence C2 (eventually C1) is true.
- C3 is also true for the same reason.
- C4 requires C3 to hold in the next state. But after event1 no other events can happen, so there is no next state. Under standard temporal semantics, X φ is false when there is no successor state. Thus C4 is false.
- C5 = G C4 is therefore false (C4 does not hold now).
- We have C2 true and C5 false, so the implication C2 → C5 is false.

Final answer:
False
---

---
Step 1 — interpret the context and temporal assumptions
- Initially event1 has happened (so at the initial state event1 is true).
- After event1 no other events can happen → the initial state is terminal (there is no next state).
- After event2 event1 must happen (not used further because event2 never occurs here).

Step 2 — evaluate the Ci formulas
- C1: “event2 happens or event1 happens.” At the initial state event1 has happened, so C1 is true now.
- C2: “C1 eventually holds.” Since C1 holds at the current (initial) state, C2 is true.
- C3: same as C2, so C3 is true.
- C4: “C3 holds in the next state.” There is no next state (state is terminal), so the next-state formula is false. Hence C4 is false.
- C5: “C4 always holds.” Because C4 is false at the initial state, C5 is false.
- C6: “If C2 holds, then C5 holds.” C2 is true but C5 is false, so the implication is false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step summary):

- Initial state S0: event1 happens (given).
- C1 (in S0): ""event1 happens and event1 happens"" — true.
- C2 (in S0): ""C1 holds in the next state"" — next state S1 has event2 (and no event1), so C1 does not hold there → C2 is false.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens"" — since C2 is false, this implication is vacuously true.
- C4: ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds"" — in S0 event2 does not happen, so this implication is vacuously true; thus C4 is true in S0.
- C5: ""C4 holds and event1 happens"" — both parts are true in S0, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""event1 happens and event1 happens"" — true in S0 (same as C1).
- C7: ""C5 holds or C6 holds"" — at least one (in fact both) hold in S0, so C7 is True.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event1 happened, so ""event1"" is true in the initial state.
- C1 is ""event1 and event1"", so C1 is true in the initial state.
- C6 is the same as C1 (""event1 and event1""), so C6 is true in the initial state.
- C7 is ""C5 or C6"". Since C6 is true, the disjunction C7 is true regardless of C5.

Therefore C7 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C7 (C5 holds or C6 holds) is true given the context.

Step 2 — timeline from the context
- s0 (initial): event1 happened.
- s1 (next): event2 happens (required after event1).
- After s1: no further events.

Step 3 — evaluate conditions at the initial state s0
- C1: ""event1 and event1"" — true at s0 (event1 holds).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — at s1 C1 is false (event1 does not hold there), so C2 is false at s0.
- C3: ""If C2 then event2"" — implication with false antecedent is true, so C3 is true at s0.
- C4: ""If event2 then C3"" — event2 is false at s0, so the implication is true at s0.
- C5: ""C4 and event1"" — C4 true and event1 true, so C5 is true at s0.
- C6: ""event1 and event1"" — same as C1, true at s0.
- C7: ""C5 or C6"" — both C5 and C6 are true, so C7 is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event1 happened.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" implies event2 never occurs at any future point.
- C1 (""event1 happens in the next state"") is false (no events can occur after the initial event1).
- C2 and C3 (which require event2 and C1) are therefore false.
- C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is false because C3 never becomes true.
- C5 (""if C2 then C4"") is vacuously true, since C2 is false.
- C6 is ""event1 happens or C5 holds"". At the initial state event1 did happen, so the first disjunct is true; even if one interpreted that disjunct as false, C5 is true, so the disjunction is true.

Thus C6 is True.
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initial state: event1 has happened.
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, there are no further events).
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 were to occur then event1 would have to occur afterward).

Step 2 — evaluate each condition at the initial point
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" False. Event1 already happened initially, and by Rule A no events happen after that, so it does not happen in the next state.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" False, because C1 is false (and event2 cannot occur after event1).
- C3: same as C2, so False.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" False: C3 never holds (no future events after event1), so C3 does not eventually become true.
- C5: ""If C2 holds, then C4 holds."" True. This implication is vacuously true because C2 is false.
- C6: ""Event1 happens or C5 holds."" True. Event1 has happened (so the left disjunct is true), and C5 is also true; either way the disjunction is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Goal: determine whether C6 (""Event1 happens or C5 holds"") is true given the context.

Context summary
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so no events occur in any state following the initial one).
- After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant if event2 never occurs).

Evaluate the Ci step by step
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" After the initial event1, no events can happen in subsequent states, so event1 does not happen in the next state. Thus C1 is false.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" Event2 cannot happen after event1, and C1 is false, so C2 is false.
- C3: same as C2, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Since C3 is false and cannot become true later (no events can occur), C4 is false.
- C5: ""If C2 holds, then C4 holds."" C2 is false, so the implication is vacuously true. Hence C5 is true.

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C7 (""Event1 happens or C6 holds"") is true given the context.

Step-by-step:

- Context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen (also after event1 no other events can happen). So event2 does happen; event1 does not happen anywhere (there is no later state in which event1 can occur).

- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (A → A), so C1 is true.

- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" C1 holds but event1 does not happen, so C2 is false.

- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" Event2 does happen, but C2 is false, so C3 is false.

- C4: same as C1, a tautology, so C4 is true.

- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" C4 is true, so the implication is true (whether or not C3 holds). Thus C5 is true.

- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" There is no next state because after event2 no other events can happen; under standard ""next"" semantics at a terminal state, the next-state claim is false. So C6 is false.

- C7: ""Event1 happens or C6 holds."" Both disjuncts are false (event1 does not happen, C6 is false), so C7 is false.

Final answer:
False
---

---
Answer: False

Reasoning, step by step:

- The goal: decide the truth of C7, which is ""event1 happens or C6 holds.""

- From the context: initially event2 happened. Also, after event2 no other events can happen (and likewise after event1 no other events can happen). So event2 occurs in the initial state, and there is no successor state after that (no further events can occur), and event1 does not occur at any time.

- Evaluate the conditions:
  - C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology, so C1 is true.
  - C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" Since C1 is true, C2 reduces to ""event1 happens."" So C2 is true iff event1 happens.
  - C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" Because event2 does happen (initially), C3 requires C2 to hold; hence C3 is equivalent here to C2 (so C3 is true iff event1 happens).
  - C4: same tautology as C1, so C4 is true.
  - C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" Since C4 is true, C5 is true regardless of C3.
  - C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" But there is no next state after the initial event2 (no further events can happen), so the “next” statement is false (next-state formulas fail at terminal states). Thus C6 is false.
  - Event1 does not happen (it cannot occur after event2, and it was not given as initially happening), so the left disjunct of C7 (""event1 happens"") is false.

- Therefore both disjuncts of C7 are false (event1 does not happen, and C6 is false), so C7 is false."

Reasoning step-by-step:

- From the context: initially event1 happened (so event1 is true at the initial state). Also, after event1 no other events can happen, so no events (including event2) can occur in any state after that initial state. Thus event2 never occurs at or after the initial state.

- Evaluate the conditions:
  - C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" This requires event2, which does not occur, so C1 is false.
  - C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" At the initial state event1 happens, so C2 is true at the initial state.
  - C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" In the next state no events occur, so event1 does not happen there and C1 is false there; therefore C2 is false in the next state, so C3 is false.
  - C4: same as C1, false.
  - C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" Both are false, so C5 is false.
  - C6: ""C5 always holds."" Since C5 is already false at the initial state, C6 is false.
  - C7: ""C6 holds and event1 happens."" C6 is false, so C7 is false (false AND true = false).

Therefore C7 is False.
---

---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C7 = (C6 holds) AND (event1 happens). We must decide whether C7 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — facts from the context
- Initially, event1 happened (so event1 is true at the initial state).
- After event1, no other events can happen. Since event1 happens initially, no events (including event2) can occur at any later time.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never occurs (given the second fact), so that implication is vacuously satisfied.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""event2 happens and event1 happens."" This is false, because event2 cannot happen.
- C2: ""event1 happens or C1 holds."" Since event1 does happen initially, C2 is true at the initial state.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" There is no possible future state in which any event can happen after the initial event1, so in the next state (if one exists) event1 does not hold; hence C2 does not hold in that next state. Therefore C3 is false at the initial state.
- C4: same as C1, so false.
- C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" Since both C3 and C4 are false at the initial state, C5 is false at the initial state.
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" Because C5 is false at the initial state, C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 holds and event1 happens."" event1 does happen, but C6 is false, so the conjunction C7 is false.

Step 2 — understand each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (P → P), so C1 is true in any state where it is evaluated.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Since C1 is a tautology, C1 holds in every state, so C2 holds whenever we ask about the next state.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" That is, at every state, the next state satisfies C1. Because C1 is always true, C2 is true in every state, so C3 holds.
- C4: ""C2 always holds."" This is the same statement as C3.

Step 3 — trace events (consistency check)
- The event rules (initially event2; after event2 → event1; after event1 → event2) produce an infinite alternating sequence 2,1,2,1,... This sequence does not contradict any Ci; combined with the logical observation that C1 is a tautology, C2, C3, C4 all hold in this system.

Step 4 — evaluate C5
- C3 and C4 are identical statements. Therefore ""If C3 holds then C4 holds"" is logically true (either because both hold, or because they are the same proposition so C3 ⇒ C4 is valid).

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C5 (""If C3 holds, then C4 holds"") is true or false under the given system.

Step 2 — understand the system
- Initially event2 occurs.
- After event2, event1 must occur; after event1, event2 must occur. So the system produces an infinite alternating trace: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a propositional tautology (P → P). It holds in every state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Since C1 holds in every state, C1 also holds in every next state; therefore C2 holds in every state (and the system has a next state at every step because of the infinite alternation).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Because C2 holds in every state, C3 is true.
- C4: ""C2 always holds."" This is the same as C3, so C4 is also true.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" Since C3 is true and C4 is true (and in fact C3 and C4 are the same assertion), the implication C5 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""If C3 holds, then C4 holds"") is true given the context and the definitions of C1–C4.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautological implication (P → P), so C1 is true in every state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Since C1 is true in every state, C1 will also be true in the next state; therefore C2 holds in every state.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Because C2 is true in every state, C3 is true.
- C4: ""C2 always holds."" C4 is the same as C3 and so is true.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" This is of the form P → P (the antecedent and consequent are the same proposition), so it is trivially true whenever C3 is well-defined.

Step 3 — role of the event sequence
- The context forces an alternating sequence starting from event2, but that sequence does not affect the tautological nature of C1–C4. All those conditions hold regardless of the alternation.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. From the context:
   - Initially event1 happens.
   - After event1 no other events can happen → once event1 has occurred, event2 can never occur later.
   - Therefore event2 never happens at any point.

2. Evaluate the conditions:
   - C1: ""Event2 always happens."" False (event2 never happens).
   - C2: same as C1, so False.
   - C3: ""C2 does not hold."" True (since C2 is false).
   - C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" True (C3 already holds at the start).
   - C5: ""If C1 holds, then C4 holds."" True (implication is vacuously true because C1 is false).
   - C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" True — the same reasoning applies in the next state (event2 still never happens), so C5 holds there.
   - C7: ""C6 always holds."" True — C6 holds in every state (the situation is unchanged in every future state), so C6 is always true.

Therefore C7 is True.
---
Goal: decide whether C7 (""C6 always holds"") is True or False.

Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen → the initial state is terminal (there is no next state, no later events).
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 never occurs (there is no opportunity for it after the initial event1).

Step 2 — evaluate the Ci one by one in the initial (and only) state
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" False — event2 does not occur in the initial (and only) state.
- C2: same as C1, so False.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" True (because C2 is False).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" True — C3 already holds now.
- C5: ""If C1 holds, then C4 holds."" True — the implication is vacuously true because C1 is false.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" False — there is no next state, so a ""next"" statement is not satisfied in the only state.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" False — C6 is false in the only state, so it does not always hold.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
C7 says: ""C6 always holds."" We must decide True or False given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened (so the initial state already has event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so there are no further states with events after the initial state).
- Also: ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 will never occur if no events can happen after event1.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1 / C2: ""Event2 always happens."" Given that event1 already happened and no further events can occur, event2 does not happen. So C1 and C2 are false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false, C3 is true (the negation of a false statement).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 already holds in the initial state, so ""eventually C3"" is true.
- C5: ""If C1 holds, then C4 holds."" C1 is false, so the implication is vacuously true; C5 holds.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" But there is no next state (no events can happen after the initial state). Under the usual temporal semantics (the strong next operator), ""X φ"" is false at a state that has no successor. Therefore C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" Because C6 is false in the initial (and only) state, C7 is false.

Goal: determine whether C6 (""C5 eventually holds"") is True or False.

Step-by-step:

1. From the context, event1 occurs initially and the system forces alternation (after event1 → event2, after event2 → event1). Therefore both event1 and event2 do occur (indeed infinitely often). So C1 (""Event1 happens and event2 happens"") is true.

2. C2 and C3 are each ""C1 holds or event2 happens"". Since C1 is true, both C2 and C3 are true (everywhere).

3. C4 is ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" Given C2 is true and C3 is true, the implication C4 holds (in fact it holds at every time/point).

4. C5 says ""C4 always holds."" Because C4 holds at every time (as just argued), C5 holds.

5. C6 is ""C5 eventually holds."" If C5 holds always, then it certainly holds at some eventual time — so C6 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Identify the question
- We must decide whether C6 (""C5 eventually holds"") is True or False given the event sequence and the Ci definitions.

Examine the conditions
- From the context: event1 happens initially, then event2 must happen, then event1 must happen, etc. So both event1 and event2 occur (in fact they alternate indefinitely).
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" Given the alternating sequence, both events do occur, so C1 is true (once both have occurred).
- C2 and C3: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" Since C1 is true (after event2 has occurred) these are true; even before C1 becomes true they are true exactly when event2 happens. In any case C2 and C3 hold whenever relevant.
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" C2 and C3 are the same formula, so this implication is always true.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" Because C4 is true at every moment, C5 is true.
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" Since C5 already holds (always), it certainly holds eventually.

Final answer
True
---
Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
Thus the execution alternates event1, event2, event1, event2, ... so both events occur (in fact infinitely often).

Step 2 — evaluate conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" True (both occur in the sequence).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" True, because C1 is true (and event2 also happens).
- C3: same as C2, so True.
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" True (C2 and C3 are true, and the implication holds).
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" True — C4 is a valid implication here and holds at all times.
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" If C5 always holds, it certainly holds eventually. So C6 is True.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify question
We must decide whether C7 (the statement ""C6 always holds"") is true or false, given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Because event1 happened initially, no event (including event2) can ever occur at any later time.
- Also the context says “After event2, event1 must happen,” but since event2 never occurs in any admissible timeline, that requirement is vacuously satisfied.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions in order
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Since event2 never happens, this implication is true (vacuously true), and it’s consistent with the context.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is true, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" C2 is false, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" C3 is false, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" C4 is false, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" C5 is false, so C6 is true.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" C6 is true (and the falsity of C5 is a global fact under the context), so C6 holds at all times; therefore C7 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true or false given the context and the chain of C1..C7.

Step 2 — restate the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so ""if event2 happens then event1 happens"" — this is C1).
- After event1, no other events can happen. Because event1 already happened initially, no further events can occur in any future state.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions one by one
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" This is given by the context, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is true, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" C2 is false, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" C3 is false, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" C4 is false, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" C5 is false, so C6 is true.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" Because nothing in the context allows these truth-values to change (no further events can occur after the initial event1), C6 is true in all reachable states, so C7 is true.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C7 is True.
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must determine whether C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true given the context and the chain of C1–C7.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., whenever event2 occurs, event1 follows).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, no further events occur).

Because event1 happens initially and no events can occur after event1, event2 never actually occurs in any allowed execution.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions one by one
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" This is true (it is explicitly given by the context, and also vacuously true because event2 never happens).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Negation of C1 → false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" C2 is false, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" C3 is false, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" C4 is false, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" Since C5 is false, C6 is true.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" C6 is true (a global factual truth here), so C7 is true.

Answer: False

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

- The context gives a timeline: event1 happens initially; after event1, event2 must happen; and after event2 no further events can occur. So event2 does occur at some later time, and then the system is terminal.

- C1 (""If event1 happens, then event1 happens"") is a tautology and holds at every state.

- C2 and C3 (""If C1 holds, then event2 happens"") have the true antecedent (C1) and are therefore true at states before event2 occurs (in particular the initial state), because event2 will happen thereafter. So C2 and C3 hold initially.

- C4 (C2 or C3) therefore holds initially; C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") holds at the initial state as well.

- However, after event2 has occurred, no further events happen. At those post‑event2 states the consequent ""event2 happens"" (understood as happening in the future) is false, so C2 and C3 no longer hold, hence C4 is false there. Since nothing will change after event2, from a post‑event2 state C4 will never again hold, so C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is false in those states.

- C6 asserts that C5 always holds (i.e., at every state). Because C5 is false in the post‑event2 states, C6 is false.

Therefore C6 is False.

Reasoning step-by-step

1. Identify the question
- We must evaluate the truth of C7: ""If C6 holds, then event1 happens"" under the given facts.

2. Understand the given facts
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- (Also: after event1 no other events can happen, but that is irrelevant once we know event1 never happens.)

3. Evaluate the conditions in order
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" Since event2 happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, event1 does not happen. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Requires event1 (false) and C1 (false) — so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" C2 is false now and remains false in all future states (no events occur), so C3 is false.
- C4, C5: similarly false (they are further next-state assertions built on false statements).
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" Because C5 is false now (and in all states), C6 is false.

4. Evaluate C7
- C7 is an implication: (C6) -> (event1).
- The antecedent C6 is false in the actual model, so the implication is vacuously true.

Therefore C7 is True.
---
We ask whether C7 (""If C6 holds, then event1 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 1 — understand the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (and likewise after event1 no other events can happen).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1: event2 happens and event1 happens. But since event2 happens initially and no other events can happen afterward, event1 cannot happen after event2. So C1 is impossible (false).
- C2 requires event1 and C1, so C2 is false.
- C3 requires C2 in the next state, so C3 is false.
- Similarly C4 and C5 are all false by propagation.
- C6 says C5 always holds; since C5 is false, C6 is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C7 (C6 → event1)
- The antecedent C6 is false in this model. An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously true).

Therefore C7 is True.

- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has occurred at some state, in all subsequent states no events occur).

Step 2 — consequences for event1
- Since event2 happened initially and Rule B forbids any events after event2, event1 cannot occur in any future state. Also event1 did not occur at the initial state (if it had, it would be an event after event2 or simultaneous, contradicting the given ordering), so event1 never happens. Therefore ""Event1 does not happen"" is true at the initial state and at all states.

Step 3 — evaluate the Ci formulas
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" True (event1 never occurs).
- C2: same as C1 — True.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" True, because event1 never occurs, so C2 is true in every next state.
- C4: ""Event2 happens or C3 holds."" At the initial state event2 happens, and in any state C3 holds, so C4 is true in every state.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" True (C4 holds at every state).
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" True (C5 is globally true).
- C7: ""C1 holds or C6 holds."" Since C1 is true, C7 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Short answer: True.

Brief justification: Initially event2 occurs and event1 does not, and after event2 no further events occur so event1 never occurs in any future state. Thus C1 (event1 does not happen) is true in the initial state. That alone makes C7 (C1 or C6) true. Therefore C7 is True."

Sample responses:
C7 is True.

Reasoning step-by-step:

- We start in s0 where event1 happened (given).
- By ""after event1, event2 must happen"", in the next state s1 event2 holds (so event1 does not hold in s1).
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" — false at s0 (because s1 has event2).
- C2 is the same as C1 — also false.
- C3 = C1 and C2 — false.
- C4 = not C3 — true.
- C5 = (event2) or C4 — true at s0 because C4 is true (so C5 holds immediately).
- C6 = ""eventually C5"" — true (C5 already holds now, so it holds eventually).
- C7 = ""eventually C6"" — true (C6 holds now, so it holds eventually).

Therefore C7 is True.
---
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- C1 and C2 are the same claim (event1 in the next state), so C3 (C1 and C2) is equivalent to ""event1 in the next state.""
- From the context: initially event1 happened, and ""after event1, event2 must happen"" means the next state contains event2. So event1 does not happen in the next state, hence C3 is false and C4 (¬C3) is true.
- C5 is ""event2 happens or C4 holds."" Since C4 is already true, C5 is true in the initial state.
- C6 is ""C5 eventually holds."" Because C5 already holds now, C6 is true.
- C7 is ""C6 eventually holds."" Because C6 already holds now, C7 is true.
---
First, identify the goal: C7 says ""eventually C6 holds"" (i.e. F(C6)). We must decide whether C7 is true given the context.

Context and dynamics
- Initially event1 happened (call that state 0).
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" and ""after event2, event1 must happen"" force an alternating sequence:
  state0: event1; state1: event2; state2: event1; state3: event2; … (forever alternating).

Examine the conditions at the initial state
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" At state0 the next state is state1, which has event2, so C1 is false.
- C2 is the same as C1, so C2 is false.
- C3 = C1 and C2 is therefore false.
- C4 = not C3 is true.
- C5 = ""Event2 happens or C4 holds."" At state0, C4 holds (and also event2 will happen next), so C5 is true at state0.
- C6 = ""C5 eventually holds."" Since C5 already holds at state0, C6 is true at state0.
- C7 = ""C6 eventually holds."" Because C6 holds now, it certainly holds at some (the current) future point, so C7 is true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
- C7 is the formula ""Event2 happens or C6 holds."" We must evaluate whether C7 is true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context and conditions
- Initially, event2 happened (so at the initial state “event2 happens” is true).
- After event1 or event2, no other events can happen (both events are terminal).
- C1 = ""Event1 always happens."" This is false (event1 does not happen in the initial state, and no future events occur).
- C2, C3, C4 are next-state iterations of C1 and therefore false.
- C5 = ""Event1 happens and C4"" is false.
- C6 = ""C5 or event1"" is false (both disjuncts false).

Step 3 — evaluate C7
- C7 = ""Event2 happens or C6 holds."" The initial state satisfies “event2 happens,” so C7 is true regardless of C6.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C7 (""Event2 happens or C6 holds"") is true in the described situation.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event2 happened. So in the initial state ""Event2 happens"" is true.
- After event2 no other events can happen, so event1 cannot occur in the initial or any subsequent state.

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" This is false (event1 does not occur at/after the initial state).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3: similarly false (C2 holds in the next state) — false.
- C4: similarly false — false.
- C5: ""Event1 happens and C4 holds."" Event1 does not happen, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 holds or event1 happens."" Both disjuncts are false, so C6 is false.
- C7: ""Event2 happens or C6 holds."" The left disjunct (""Event2 happens"") is true in the initial state, so C7 is true regardless of C6.

Final answer:
True

Answer: True

Reasoning step by step:

1. Context: Initially event2 happened. Also, after event1 no other events can happen, and after event2 no other events can happen. So the initial (and only reachable) occurrence is event2; event1 does not occur in the initial state and no further events can occur after the initial state.

2. Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" This is false (event1 does not occur in the initial state).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" False (C1 is false).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" False.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" False.
- C5: ""Event1 happens and C4 holds."" False (event1 does not happen).
- C6: ""C5 holds or event1 happens."" False.
- C7: ""Event2 happens or C6 holds."" Event2 does happen (initially), so this disjunction is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — understand context
- Initially, event1 happened → event1 is true.
- After event1, event2 must happen → event2 will occur (so event2 is true).
- After event2, no other events can happen → nothing after event2, but that doesn't prevent event2 itself.

So both event1 and event2 are true.

Step 2 — evaluate conditions
- C1: event1 happens or event2 happens. True (both happen).
- C2: event1 happens or event2 happens. True.
- C3: C2 holds and event2 happens. True (C2 true and event2 true).
- C4: If C3 holds, then event2 happens. True (antecedent true and consequent true).
- C5: C1 holds and C4 holds. True (both true).
- C6: event1 happens or event2 happens. True.
- C7: C5 holds or C6 holds. True (both disjuncts true).

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
We must decide whether C7 is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur at some point after event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal). These extra rules don’t undermine that event1 already happened.

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: event1 ∨ event2.
- C2: event1 ∨ event2 (same as C1).
- C3: C2 ∧ event2, i.e. (event1 ∨ event2) ∧ event2. That simplifies to event2.
- C4: C3 → event2. Since C3 is equivalent to event2, this is event2 → event2, which is always true; so C4 is true.
- C5: C1 ∧ C4, i.e. (event1 ∨ event2) ∧ True, so C5 ≡ event1 ∨ event2.
- C6: event1 ∨ event2 (same again).
- C7: C5 ∨ C6, which is (event1 ∨ event2) ∨ (event1 ∨ event2) ≡ event1 ∨ event2.

Step 4 — evaluate with the context
We know event1 happened initially, so event1 ∨ event2 is true.

Final answer
True
---
True

Brief justification (concise, non-confidential):

- From the context: event1 occurs initially, and after event1 event2 must occur; therefore both event1 and event2 happen.
- Evaluate conditions:
  - C1, C2, C6: ""event1 happens or event2 happens"" — true.
  - C3: C2 holds and event2 happens — true.
  - C4: if C3 holds then event2 happens — true (antecedent true and consequent true).
  - C5: C1 holds and C4 holds — true.
  - C7: C5 holds or C6 holds — true (both disjuncts true).

Sample responses:
The question: is C7 true or false?

Step-by-step:

- From the context: event2 happened (initially). After event2 no other events can happen. And after event1, event2 must happen.
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This is exactly given by the context, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" C1 is already true, so C2 is true (an implication with a true consequent is true).
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" C2 holds, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This contradicts C3, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" Since C4 is false, C5 does not hold (false).
- C6: ""If C5 holds, then event2 happens."" C5 is false, so this implication is vacuously true — C6 holds.
- C7: ""If C6 holds, then event2 happens."" C6 holds and event2 did happen (initially), so this implication is true.

Therefore C7 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify goal
- We must decide whether C7 (""If C6 holds, then event2 happens"") is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — use the context
- Initially, event2 happened. So ""event2 happens"" is true.
- Also: after event2 no other events can happen, and after event1 event2 must happen. (These ensure C1 below but don't block the following logical deductions.)

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: If event1 happens, then event2 happens. This matches the context, so C1 is true.
- C2: If event1 happens, then C1 holds. Since C1 is true unconditionally, the implication C2 is true (an implication with a true consequent is true).
- C3: Event1 happens or C2 holds. C2 holds, so C3 is true.
- C4: C3 does not hold. This contradicts C3, so C4 is false.
- C5: C4 always holds. Since C4 is false, C5 is false.
- C6: If C5 holds, then event2 happens. C5 is false, so the implication C6 is true (vacuously).
- Thus C6 holds.

Step 4 — evaluate C7
- C7 is ""If C6 holds, then event2 happens."" We have C6 true and event2 is true (from the initial fact). So the implication C7 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- The question asks whether C7 (""If C6 holds, then event2 happens"") is True or False.

Step 2 — facts from the context
- Initially, event2 happened. So the proposition ""event2 happens"" is true.
- After event2, no other events can happen; since event2 already happened initially, no other events (including event1) can occur later.
- Also, ""After event1, event2 must happen"" gives the implication: if event1 happens then event2 happens.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This matches the context rule, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" C1 is true unconditionally, so C2 is true (the consequent is true).
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" C2 holds, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This is false because C3 is true.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" C4 is false, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""If C5 holds, then event2 happens."" C5 is false, so this implication is vacuously true; C6 holds.
- C7: ""If C6 holds, then event2 happens."" C6 holds (just shown), and event2 indeed happens (it happened initially), so the implication is true.

True

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

1. From the context the events must alternate forever: initial state has event2, then event1, then event2, then event1, … So event2 occurs at every even step and does not occur at every state.

2. C1: ""Event2 always happens"" (G event2) — false, because event2 does not occur at the odd steps.

3. C2: ""C1 always holds"" (G C1) — false too (G G event2 = G event2, so equivalent to C1).

4. C3: ""C2 always holds"" (G C2) — also false (equivalent again to G event2).

5. C4: ""Event2 happens or C3 holds"" — at even steps event2 is true so C4 is true at those steps; at odd steps event2 is false and C3 is false, so C4 is false at odd steps.

6. C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" (F C4) — true at every state, because an event2 (hence C4) will occur at the next even step; from any state there is some future state where C4 holds.

7. C6: ""C5 always holds"" (G C5) — true, because we just saw C5 is true at every state.

8. C7: ""C6 holds in the next state"" (X C6) — true, since C6 holds at every state, it certainly holds in the next state.

Therefore C7 is True.
---
Step 1 — interpret the context and temporal operators
- Start state s0: event2 is true initially.
- Rules: after event2, event1 must happen (so some later state has event1); after event1, event2 must happen. That forces an infinite alternation of states: s0: event2, s1: event1, s2: event2, s3: event1, ...
- Interpretations: ""always"" = globally (G), ""eventually"" = finally (F), ""in the next state"" = X.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition on the alternating sequence
- C1 = G(event2). This is false: event2 does not hold at the event1 states (e.g. s1), so it is not true at all future states.
- C2 = G(C1). Since C1 is false at s0 (and at other states), C2 is false.
- C3 = G(C2). C2 is false, so C3 is false.
- C4 = event2 ∨ C3. This is true exactly in those states where event2 is true (the even states s0, s2, ...); false in the event1 states (odd states).
- C5 = F(C4). From any state there is a next (or current) even state where event2 (hence C4) holds, so F(C4) is true at every state.
- C6 = G(F(C4)). Because F(C4) holds at every state, G(F(C4)) is true everywhere.
- C7 = X(C6). Since C6 is true in every state, it is in particular true in the next state, so X(C6) is true.

Final answer by majority vote: True

True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context the only possible event sequence is: state0 (initial) has event2, then state1 has event1, and after event1 no further events occur.

- Evaluate C1 and C2 at the initial state: they claim ""event2 happens in the next state."" The next state (state1) has event1, not event2, so C1 and C2 are false.

- C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") and C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") are false because C2 never holds at any future state given the fixed sequence.

- C5 (""If C4 holds, then event2 happens"") is an implication with a false antecedent (C4 is false), so C5 is true (vacuously).

- C6 (""C5 does not hold"") is therefore false.

- C7 (""If C1 holds, then C6 holds"") has a false antecedent (C1 is false), so the implication C7 is true (vacuously).

Therefore C7 is True.
---

Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context we have a unique timeline:
   - Initially event2 happened (time 0).
   - After event2, event1 must happen (so at time 1 event1 occurs).
   - After event1 no other events can happen (so from time 2 onward no events).

2. Evaluate the Ci’s on that timeline:
   - C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" At time 0 the next state (time 1) has event1, not event2 → C1 is false.
   - C2: same as C1 → C2 is false.
   - C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 never holds, C3 is false.
   - C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Since C3 is false and never becomes true, C4 is false.
   - C5: ""If C4 holds, then event2 happens."" This implication has a false antecedent (C4 false), so C5 is true (vacuously).
   - C6: ""C5 does not hold."" Since C5 is true, C6 is false.

3. C7 is ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds"" (C1 -> C6). Since C1 is false on the timeline, the implication C1 -> C6 is true (a false antecedent makes the implication true).

Therefore C7 is True."

Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step

1. From the context: initially event2 happened, and the rules force alternation:
   - After event2, event1 must happen.
   - After event1, event2 must happen.
   So the event sequence is ... 2,1,2,1,2,1 ... forever (alternation).

2. C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
   - At a state where the current event is event1, the next is event2, so C1 is true there.
   - At a state where the current event is event2, the next is event1, so C1 is false there.
   ⇒ C1 is not universally true (it holds at some states and fails at others).

3. C2: ""C1 always holds.""
   - Because C1 fails at states where the current event is event2, C2 is false at every state (there is always a next state where C1 fails).
   ⇒ C2 does not hold.

4. C3: ""C2 does not hold.""
   - Since C2 is false everywhere, C3 is true at every state.

5. C4: same as C1, so as above it is not always true (false at event2 states).

6. C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds.""
   - C3 already holds at every state, so C5 is true at every state.

7. C6: ""C5 eventually holds.""
   - Because C5 already holds now at every state, it certainly eventually holds (immediately).
   - Thus C6 is true at every state.

8. C7: ""C6 always holds.""
   - As C6 is true at every state, C7 is true.

Therefore C7 is True.
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
We must decide whether C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true or false given the context and the definitions C1–C6.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event2 occurs (call that time 0).
- After event2 must come event1.
- After event1 must come event2.
So the trace is an infinite alternation: time 0: event2, time 1: event1, time 2: event2, time 3: event1, …

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions one by one
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" At time 0 the next state (time 1) has event1, so C1 is false at time 0. In general C1 is false in states where the next state is event1 (i.e. immediately after an event2).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" That is false, because we already found states (e.g. time 0) where C1 is false. So C2 does not hold.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false, C3 is true (this is a global fact about the trace).
- C4: same as C1, false at time 0.
- C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" Because C3 is true, C5 is true (everywhere).
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" If C5 already holds now (indeed it does in every state), then ""eventually C5"" is true (it holds immediately).
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" Since C5 is true in every state, C6 (""eventually C5"") is true in every state, so C6 always holds. Therefore C7 is true.

False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event1 occurs, and after event1 no events can ever happen again. So at time 0 event1 is true, at all later times no events (including event1) occur.
- C1 and C6 (""event1 always happens"") are false because event1 does not hold at times after the initial state.
- C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false (from the next state onward event1 does not always hold).
- C3 (C2 ∧ event1) is false at the initial state because C2 is false.
- C4 (C3 in the next state) is false because C3 is false at the next state.
- C5 (always C4) is false because C4 is already false.
- Therefore C7 = C5 ∨ C6 = false ∨ false = False.
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C7 (""C5 holds or C6 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event1 has happened (so the initial state satisfies event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen — the state after event1 is terminal (there is no next state).
- (Also: after event2 no other events can happen, but event2 does not occur initially.)

Step 3 — interpret the temporal claims (standard interpretation: ""always"" = holds in all reachable states; ""next"" requires an actual next state; if no next state exists, Xφ is false)
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" There is only the initial (and terminal) state, and event1 holds there → C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" There is no next state (terminal), so the next-state claim is false → C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" C2 is false, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" No next state and C3 is false, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" C4 is false, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""Event1 always happens."" Same as C1, so C6 is true.

Step 4 — evaluate C7
- C7 = (C5 holds) or (C6 holds) = false or true = true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning:
- The initial (and only) state has event2 occur. After event2 no other events can happen, so the trace has no next state.
- C1 and C2 (""Event2 always happens"") are true: in the single-state trace event2 holds at every state (there are no other states to falsify it).
- C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true because C2 already holds in the initial state.
- C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is false because there is no next state (the next operator fails at a terminal state).
- C5 (C1 and C4) is therefore false (true AND false = false).
- C6 (""eventually C5"") is false because C5 never holds and there are no future states.
- C7 (""eventually C6"") is false for the same reason.

Thus C7 is False.
---
We ask: is C7 true?

Model the run: there is an initial state S0 where event2 happened, and S0 has no successor (because after event2 no other events can happen).

Evaluate the Ci at S0:

- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" (□ event2). On the one-state trace {S0} with event2 true, this holds. So C1 is true.
- C2: same as C1, so true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" (◇C2). C2 already holds at S0, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" (X C3). There is no next state from S0, so X C3 is false.
- C5: C1 ∧ C4. Since C4 is false, C5 is false.
- C6: ""Eventually C5"" (◇C5). There are no future states where C5 could become true, so C6 is false.
- C7: ""Eventually C6"" (◇C6). Same reasoning: C6 is false and there are no future states, so C7 is false.

Therefore C7 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- The scenario gives a single initial state where event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen — so there are no successor states (the trace ends at the initial state).

- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" True — at the only state event2 holds, so it holds globally.

- C2: same as C1, so True.

- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" True — C2 already holds now.

- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" False — there is no next state after the initial (the trace ends), so ""next C3"" is false.

- C5: ""C1 and C4."" False, because C4 is false.

- C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" False — C5 is false now and there are no future states to make it true.

- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" False, because C6 never becomes true.

Therefore C7 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Context gives that event2 happened initially, and thereafter event1 and event2 must alternate (after event2, event1 must happen; after event1, event2 must happen). In particular event2 does occur (it already did initially and will recur).
- C1 and C2 both assert ""event2 does not happen."" Given the context, that assertion is false.
- C3 = C1 ∧ C2 is therefore false.
- C4 = ""C3 eventually holds"" is false because C3 is false (there is never a moment where ""event2 does not happen"" as a global claim is satisfied).
- C5 = C4 ∧ event2 happens is false (C4 is false, even though event2 does happen).
- C6 = ""C5 does not hold"" is true (since C5 is false).
- C7 = ""C6 does not hold"" is therefore false.

Hence C7 is False.
---
We want to decide whether C7 is true or false.

Context facts:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
Thus event2 does occur (at least initially) and, because of the alternating obligations, event1 and event2 will continue to occur.

Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is false (event2 did happen initially).
- C2: same as C1, also false.
- C3: C1 and C2 — false ∧ false = false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 is false and never becomes true (event2 does happen), so C4 is false.
- C5: C4 and event2 happens — false ∧ true = false.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" Since C5 is false, C6 is true.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" C6 is true, so C7 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — evaluate C1 and C2:
- The context says ""Initially, event2 happened."" So the statement ""Event2 does not happen"" is false. Therefore C1 is false and C2 is false.

Step 2 — C3:
- C3 = C1 and C2. Since C1 and C2 are false, C3 is false.

Step 3 — C4:
- C4 = ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 is already false and cannot become true (it requires event2 never happening, but event2 already happened initially), so C4 is false.

Step 4 — C5:
- C5 = C4 and event2 happens. C4 is false, so C5 is false.

Step 5 — C6:
- C6 = ""C5 does not hold."" Since C5 is false, C6 is true.

Step 6 — C7:
- C7 = ""C6 does not hold."" C6 is true, so C7 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):
- Context: initially event1 has happened, and once event1 has happened no other events can happen afterwards. Therefore, from the initial state onward no event2 can ever occur.
- C1 = ""event2 and event1"" — since event2 never occurs, C1 is false in every state.
- C2 = next(C1) and C4 = next(next(C1)). If C1 is always false then C2 and C4 are always false.
- C5 is (C2 -> C4). A false antecedent makes the implication true, so C5 is true in every state.
- C6 = always(C5) is therefore true.

So C6 is True.
---
We are asked whether C6 (""C5 always holds"") is true given the context. Step-by-step:

1. Context summary:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, no future state can have any event occur).
- After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant if event2 never occurs).

2. Evaluate C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens.""
- Since event1 already happened initially and forbids any further events, event2 cannot occur at any later time. There is no state where both event2 and event1 occur (no way for event2 to happen after the initial event1). So C1 is false in every reachable state.

3. C2, C3, C4: each is a “next” version of C1 (C2: C1 holds in the next state; C3: same; C4: C3 holds in the next state). Because C1 is false in every reachable state, these are all false everywhere as well.

4. C5: ""If C2 holds, then C4 holds."" An implication with a false antecedent is true. Since C2 is false in all reachable states, C5 is true in all reachable states (vacuously true).

5. C6: ""C5 always holds."" Because C5 holds in every reachable state, C6 is true.

Therefore the final answer is: True.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
You ask whether C7 (""If event1 happens, then C6 holds"") is true or false under the given context.

Step 2 — interpret the context and the Ci formulas
- Context: initially event2 happened; after event2, event1 must happen; after event1, event2 must happen. Thus the system alternates events: event2 at time 0, event1 at time 1, event2 at time 2, event1 at time 3, etc. So event1 does occur (at all odd times).
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" — equivalent to ""Event1 happens"".
- C2: same as C1, so also ""Event1 happens"".
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — i.e. ""Event1 does not happen"".
- C4: ""C1 holds and C3 holds"" — i.e. ""Event1 happens and Event1 does not happen"" — a contradiction, so C4 is false in every state.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" — since C4 is never true, C5 is false (it never becomes true).
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state"" — since C5 is always false, C6 is false in every state.
- C7: ""If event1 happens, then C6 holds"" — this requires that whenever event1 happens, C6 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C7 under the context
Event1 does happen in the system (at least at some states). But C6 is false in all states. Therefore there are states where the antecedent (event1 happens) is true while the consequent (C6) is false, so the implication C7 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
First, what's being asked: whether C7 (""If event1 happens, then C6 holds"") is true given the context.

Step-by-step analysis:
- C1 = ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" simplifies to: Event1 happens.
- C2 is identical to C1, so C2 = Event1 happens.
- C3 = not C2 = not (Event1 happens).
- C4 = C1 and C3 = (Event1 happens) and (not Event1 happens) — a contradiction, so C4 is never true.
- C5 = ""C4 eventually holds"" — since C4 can never hold, C5 is false in every state.
- C6 = ""C5 holds in the next state"" — since C5 is always false, C6 is false in every state.
- C7 = ""If event1 happens, then C6 holds"" is the implication (Event1 happens) -> C6. In the given context, event1 does happen (after the initial event2), so there are states where the antecedent is true while C6 is false. Therefore the implication is false in those states.

Conclusion: C7 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- C1 and C2 are both the same tautological claim ""event1 happens"" (each is ""event1 or event1""), so C1 ⇔ C2 ⇔ (event1 happens).

- C3 asserts ""C2 does not hold"", i.e. ""event1 does not happen"". So C2 and C3 are direct contradictions and cannot both be true.

- C4 = C1 and C3 requires both ""event1 happens"" and ""event1 does not happen"" simultaneously, so C4 is impossible (false).

- C5 states ""C4 eventually holds""; since C4 is impossible, C5 is false.

- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state"" is therefore false (because C5 is false).

- From the context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 event1 must happen. So event1 does in fact happen (at least eventually). Thus the antecedent of C7 (""If event1 happens, then C6 holds"") is true while the consequent C6 is false, making the implication false.

Therefore C7 is False."

Step 1 — interpret the context:
- The system starts with event1, and the rules force alternation: after event1 there must be an event2, and after event2 there must be an event1. So event1 occurs now and will recur infinitely often.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition:
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True (it already happened initially).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" True — from any point in time, because of forced alternation, event1 will occur again, so the property ""event1 eventually happens"" holds at every time.
- C3: Same as C1, so True.
- C4: ""C2 and C3"" True (both are true).
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" True — C4 holds at every time, so it is always true.
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" True — since C5 holds now (indeed always), it certainly holds at some future point.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" True — C6 already holds now, so it will hold at some future point as well.

Final answer:
True
---
Identify the question
- We must decide whether C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is True or False given the context.

Understand the context (event sequence)
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
Thus the system produces an infinite alternation: event1, event2, event1, event2, ... So from every point in time, event1 will occur again at some future time.

Examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True (event1 occurs now and also again later).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" This means at every point in time, ""event1 eventually happens"" is true. Because event1 recurs infinitely often, from every time point event1 will occur later, so C2 is True.
- C3: same as C1, True.
- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds."" Both true → C4 is True.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" Since C4 is true at every time (because C2 and C3 are true at every time), C5 is True.
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" C5 already holds now (and always), so ""eventually C5"" is True.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" C6 holds now, so ""eventually C6"" is True.

Conclusion
- C7 is True.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Interpret the context: the system starts with event1 at the initial state, and events alternate forever: state0: event1, state1: event2, state2: event1, state3: event2, ...

2. Simplify the Ci formulas:
   - C1 = ""event1 or event1"" ≡ event1 (same for C2).
   - C3 = ""C2 eventually holds"" = ""event1 eventually holds"" (F event1).
   - C4 = ""If C1 then C3"" = event1 → (F event1). This is always true at any state where event1 holds (because F includes the current state) and is vacuously true when event1 does not hold.
   - C5 = ""If event2 then C4"" = event2 → C4.
   - C6 = ""C5 eventually holds"" = F (event2 → C4).
   - C7 = ""C6 holds in the next state"" = X C6 (i.e., C6 is true at state1).

3. Evaluate on the trace:
   - At state1 (event2), event1 does occur later at state2, so C3 is true at state1. C1 is false at state1 (event1 not true there), so C4 (C1 → C3) is true (vacuously or because C3 holds).
   - Therefore at state1, event2 → C4 holds, so C5 is true at state1.
   - Hence C5 already holds at state1, so ""eventually C5"" (C6) is true at state1.
   - Thus C6 holds in the next state (state1), so C7 is true at the initial state.

Conclusion: C7 is True.
---
Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Simplify C1 and C2:
   - C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" ≡ ""Event1 happens"".
   - C2: same ≡ ""Event1 happens"".

2. Interpret C3–C4:
   - C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" ≡ ""event1 eventually happens"".
   - C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds"" ≡ ""If event1 holds now, then event1 holds eventually.""
     That implication is true in any state where either event1 does not hold now (vacuously) or event1 does hold now (then 'eventually event1' is true because it holds at the current state). So C4 is true in every state under the given behavior.

3. C5 and C6:
   - C5: ""If event2 happens, then C4 holds."" Since C4 holds in every state, C5 holds in every state (the implication is always true).
   - C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" Because C5 already holds now (indeed in every state), C6 is true.

4. C7:
   - C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" From the context (event1 at t0, event2 at t1, event1 at t2, ...), C5 and hence C6 hold at all states, including the next state. Therefore C7 is true.

Hence the hypothesis C7 is True.
---
True

Reasoning (step by step):

- Interpretations: C1 and C2 both are ""event1"" (event1 ∨ event1 ≡ event1). The context gives the state sequence: t0: event1, t1: event2, t2: event1, t3: event2, … (events alternate forever).

- At t0:
  - C1 and C2 are true (event1 holds).
  - C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true because C2 holds at t0 (eventually includes the current state).
  - C4 (""if C1 then C3"") is true (antecedent true and consequent true).
  - C5 (""if event2 then C4"") is true at t0 because C4 is true (an implication with a true consequent is true).
  - C6 (""C5 eventually holds"") is true because C5 holds at t0.

- C7 asks whether C6 holds in the next state (t1).
  - At t1 event2 holds, so evaluate C5 at t1: C5 is ""if event2 then C4"". At t1 the antecedent (event2) is true, so we need C4 at t1. C4 is ""if C1 then C3""; at t1 C1 (event1) is false, so C4 is true (an implication with false antecedent).
  - Thus C5 holds at t1. Hence ""C5 eventually holds"" (C6) holds at t1 (it already holds at that state).
  - Therefore C6 holds in the next state, so C7 is true."

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Let t0 be the initial state (event2 happened there). After event2, no other events can happen, so for all t ≥ 1 no events occur.

- C1 = ""event2 eventually happens."" At t0 this is true (event2 occurs at t0). For t ≥ 1 this is false (no future event2).

- C2 is the same as C1, so same truth values.

- C3 = (event1 happens) ∨ C2. At t0 C2 is true so C3 is true. For t ≥ 1 neither event1 nor event2 will occur, so C3 is false for t ≥ 1.

- C4 = C1 ∧ C3. True at t0 (both true), false for t ≥ 1 (both false).

- C5 = ""C4 always holds"" (G C4). Since C4 is false at t1, C5 is false at t0.

- C6 = ""C5 holds in the next state"" (X C5). C5 is false at t1, so C6 is false at t0.

- C7 = ""C6 holds in the next state"" (X C6). C6 is false at t2, so C7 is false at t0.

Therefore C7 is False.
---
We are asked whether C7 is true.

1) From the context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. So the system starts in a state S0 where event2 has occurred and S0 is terminal (no next state).

2) Evaluate conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True (it already happened in S0).
- C2: same as C1 → True.
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" C2 is true → C3 is true.
- C4: C1 and C3 → True.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" Along the single-state trace (S0 only), C4 holds in every state → C5 is true.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state"" (X C5). There is no next state after S0, so X C5 is false under the standard next-state semantics → C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state"" (X C6). Again there is no next state, so X C6 is false → C7 is false.

Therefore, C7 is False.
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initial state S0: event2 has happened.
- After event1 no further events can occur (event1 is terminal).
- After event2 no further events can occur (event2 is terminal).
So S0 is a terminal state (no successor state).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions at S0
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True at S0 (event2 already happened).
- C2: same as C1, True.
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" C2 holds, so C3 is True.
- C4: ""C1 holds and C3 holds."" Both true, so C4 is True.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" On the only (terminal) path, C4 holds in the only state S0, so C5 is True.

Step 3 — evaluate next-state formulas
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state"" (X C5). S0 has no next state (terminal), so the X operator is false at S0. Therefore C6 is False.
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state"" (X C6). Since C6 is already False at S0, and there is no next state to make X C6 true, C7 is False.

- C3 (if event2 then C2) holds because event2 is true and C2 is true.

Sample responses:
Goal: decide whether C5 is true.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- From the context: initially event2 happened. Also, ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Therefore once event2 happened, no further events (including event1) can happen.
- So event1 did not happen.
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is false because event2 did happen.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" Both disjuncts are false (C1 is false; event1 did not happen), so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" C2 is false (and event1 is false), so C3 is false.
- C4 is the same as C3, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" Both are false, so C5 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — Identify what's asked
- We must determine whether C5 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — Translate the context
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 is true.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So once event2 has happened (which it did initially), event1 cannot happen afterward.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (That would also prevent event2 after event1, but irrelevant since event2 already happened initially.)

Step 3 — Evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Since event2 did happen initially, C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" C1 is false, so C2 reduces to ""event1 happens."" But because event2 happened initially and no events can happen after event2, event1 does not happen. Thus C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" C2 is false, so C3 is false.
- C4: same as C3, so false.
- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" Both C3 and C4 are false, so C5 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — facts from the context:
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 did happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen. Therefore no event can occur after event2.
- After event1, no other events can happen (but there's no evidence event1 actually happened).

Step 2 — consequences:
- Because event2 happened (initially) and no events can occur after it, event1 cannot have happened after event2. There is also no statement that event1 happened before, so the natural reading is event1 did not happen.
- Thus ""Event2 does not happen"" (C1) is false.
- C2 = (C1 holds) or (event1 happens). C1 is false and event1 does not happen, so C2 is false.
- C3 = C2 and event1 happens. C2 is false, so C3 is false.
- C4 is the same as C3, so false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question:
- The hypothesis asks whether C7 is True or False.

Step 2 — use the context to determine facts:
- Context: initially event2 happened. After event2, event1 must happen. Therefore event1 does happen.
- Also, after event1 no other events can happen (irrelevant to truth of ""event1 happens"").

Step 3 — evaluate each condition:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This contradicts the context, so C1 is False.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is False.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is false (event1 does happen), C3 is False.
- C4: ""C1 holds or C3 holds."" Both C1 and C3 are False, so C4 is False.
- C5: ""Event1 does not happen."" Same as C1, False.
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" Since C4 and C5 are False, C6 is False.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" C6 is False, so C7 is False.

Final answer:
False
---
What the hypothesis asks:
- Ultimately whether C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true or false given the context.

Examine the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → event1 does happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen → event1 is terminal.

Examine the conditions:
- C1: Event1 does not happen. Given the context, this is false.
- C2: Event1 does not happen. Same as C1, false.
- C3: C2 always holds. Since C2 is false (event1 does happen), C3 is false.
- C4: C1 holds or C3 holds. Both C1 and C3 are false, so C4 is false.
- C5: Event1 does not happen. Again false.
- C6: C4 holds and C5 holds. Both conjuncts are false, so C6 is false.
- C7: C6 always holds. C6 is false, so C7 is false.

Conclusion:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the key fact from the context:
- event2 happened initially, and after event2 event1 must happen. So event1 does happen (and after event1 no further events can happen).

Step 2 — evaluate each condition:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" — false (event1 does happen).
- C2: ""Event1 does not happen."" — false (same as C1).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" — false, because C2 is false.
- C4: ""C1 holds or C3 holds."" — false ∨ false = false.
- C5: ""Event1 does not happen."" — false (same as C1/C2).
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" — false ∧ false = false.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" — false, because C6 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
You're asking whether C6 can be true given the context (""Initially event1 happened"" and ""After event1, no other events can happen"" and ""After event2, event1 must happen"").

Step-by-step reasoning:

- The initial state has event1. The rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" means no events can occur at any later state. So after the initial moment, event2 can never occur in any future state.
- C1 = (event2 happens AND event1 happens). Given the context, event1 does hold at the initial state; event2 cannot occur at any later state and (even if we allowed simultaneity at the initial state) there is no way for C1 to hold at any non-initial future state.
- C2 = Next(C1) requires C1 to hold at the next state. But because no events occur after the state where event1 happened, C1 cannot hold at any next state. So C2 is false at every state.
- C3 = Eventually(C2) is therefore false (C2 never becomes true).
- C4 = Next(C3) is false (C3 is false at every state).
- C5 = Next(C1) is the same as C2 and is false.
- C6 = C4 AND C5 is false AND false, hence false.

Therefore the hypothesis C6 is False. Final answer:

False
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event1 has happened.
- The rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" means once event1 has occurred (which is already the case initially) no further events can occur in any future state.
- Therefore event2 can never happen in any reachable state.
- C1 (""event2 happens and event1 happens"") requires event2 to happen; this is impossible, so C1 is false.
- If C1 is false, then C2 (C1 in the next state), C3 (eventually C2), C4 (C3 in the next state), C5 (C1 in the next state) are all false.
- C6 is the conjunction of C4 and C5, so C6 is false.
---
You ask whether C6 is true or false. Answer: False.

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. Therefore no future state can contain any event (in particular, event2 can never occur). The rule “after event2, event1 must happen” is irrelevant because event2 never occurs.

- C1 (""Event2 happens and event1 happens""): false in every state, because event2 never happens.

- C2 (""C1 holds in the next state""): false, since C1 is never true.

- C3 (""C2 eventually holds""): false, because C2 never becomes true.

- C4 (""C3 holds in the next state""): false.

- C5 (""C1 holds in the next state""): false (same reason as C2).

- C6 = C4 and C5: false and false = False.

Final answer: False."

Votes: {'False': 2}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
What is being asked
- C7 is the statement ""C6 eventually holds."" You asked whether C7 is True or False given the context.

Context (timeline of events)
- State 0 (initial): event2 happened.
- Because ""after event2, event1 must happen"", event1 happens next (State 1).
- Because ""after event1, no other events can happen"", from State 1 onward no events occur (State 2, State 3, ... have no events).

Evaluate the conditions state-by-state (LTL-style, ""next"" = the immediate next state, ""eventually"" = at some state >= current, ""always"" = at every state >= current)

State 0:
- C1: ""event2 happens in the next state"" — False (next state is State 1, where event1 happens, not event2).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" — True (event2 happens in State 0).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — False (C2 is True in State 0).
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" — True (C3 is False in State 0).
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" — True (C4 holds now at State 0, so eventually holds).
- C6: ""C5 always holds"" — False (to be true, C5 would have to hold in every state ≥ 0; we must check later states).
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds"" — to be determined after checking other states.

State 1:
- event2 does not happen in State 1 (no event2 after State 0), and in State 1 the next state (State 2) also has no events.
- C1 in State 1: False (next state doesn't have event2).
- C2 in State 1: False (neither C1 nor event2).
- C3 in State 1: True (C2 does not hold).
- C4 in State 1: False (C3 does hold, so ""C3 does not hold"" is False).
- C5 in State 1: False (there is no future state ≥1 where C4 holds; C4 only held at State 0).
- C6 in State 1: False (requires C5 to hold at every state ≥1, but C5 is already False at State 1).
- So C6 is False at State 1 and thus cannot become True later (C4 never becomes true again, so C5 never becomes true from State 1 onward).

Conclusion about C7
- C6 is False at State 0 and is False at every later state; there is no future state where C6 becomes True.
- Therefore C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is False.

Final answer:
False
---

---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Timeline forced by the context:
   - s0: event2 holds (initially).
   - Because “after event2, event1 must happen”, the next state s1 must contain event1.
   - Because “after event1, no other events can happen”, all states s2, s3, ... have no events.

2. Evaluate the conditions as LTL-style state formulas along this trace (evaluated at s0 unless otherwise noted):
   - C1 = X(event2): is event2 true in s1? No (s1 has event1), so C1 is false at s0.
   - C2 = C1 OR event2: event2 is true at s0, so C2 is true at s0.
   - C3 = NOT C2: false at s0.
   - C4 = NOT C3 = C2 (double negation): true at s0 (since C2 true).
   - C5 = Eventually C4: true at s0, because C4 already holds at s0.
   - C6 = Always C5: this must hold at every future state. At s1, C4 is false (no event2 and X(event2) false), so C5 (""eventually C4"") is false at s1. Therefore C6 is false at s0.
   - C7 = Eventually C6: since C6 is false at s0 and remains false at all future states (no later state makes C5 true everywhere), C7 is false.

Therefore C7 is False."

Sample responses:
You are asking whether C7 (""C6 does not hold"") is true given the context and the clauses C1–C6.

Step 1 — what the context gives
- Initially, event2 happened → event2 happens (true).
- After event2, event1 must happen → because event2 did happen, event1 happens (true).
- After event1 no other events can happen — this only restricts further events after event1; it does not prevent event1 from occurring.

Therefore both ""event1 happens"" and ""event2 happens"" are true.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: event1 happens or event2 happens → true (both hold).
- C2: same → true.
- C3: same → true.
- C4: C3 holds or event1 happens → true (C3 is true, and event1 is true).
- C5: If C2 holds, then C4 holds → antecedent C2 is true and consequent C4 is true, so C5 is true.
- C6: C1 holds or C5 holds → both are true, so C6 is true.
- C7: C6 does not hold → but C6 does hold, so C7 is false.

Final answer: False

You are asking whether C7 (""C6 does not hold"") is true.

From the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → so event1 happens (after event2).
- After event1 no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Therefore both event2 and event1 happen.

Evaluate the conditions:
- C1, C2, C3: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens"" — True (both happen).
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens"" — True (C3 is True).
- C5: ""If C2 holds, then C4 holds"" — True (C2 True implies C4 True).
- C6: ""C1 holds or C5 holds"" — True (C1 True and C5 True).

C7 asserts ""C6 does not hold."" But C6 does hold, so C7 is False.

Final answer:
False

We are asked whether C7 (""C6 does not hold"") is True or False.

1. From the context:
   - Initially event2 happened → E2 is true.
   - After event2, event1 must happen → E1 is true.
   - After event1, no other events can happen (no contradiction with above).

   So E1 = true and E2 = true.

2. Evaluate the conditions:
   - C1: E1 or E2 → true.
   - C2: E1 or E2 → true.
   - C3: E1 or E2 → true.
   - C4: C3 holds or E1 → true (C3 is true).
   - C5: If C2 then C4 → true (C2 true and C4 true).
   - C6: C1 or C5 → true (both true).

3. C7 states ""C6 does not hold."" Since C6 holds, C7 is false.

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. What is being asked: C7 is the negation of C6; we must determine whether C6 is false (so C7 true) or C6 is true (so C7 false) under the given event constraints.

2. Simplify the conditions:
   - C1: ""event1 and event1"" is just event1.
   - C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" means eventually event1 holds.
   - C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens"" is (eventually event1) OR (event1 now).
   - C4: negation of C3.
   - C5: C4 holds in the next state.
   - C6: (if C5 then event1).
   - C7: negation of C6.

3. Use the context:
   - Initially event2 has happened.
   - After event2, event1 must happen, and after event1, event2 must happen. So starting from the initial state there will be an event1 (and they alternate indefinitely). Hence ""eventually event1"" (C2) is true in the initial state — indeed C2 is true in every reachable state because events alternate forever.

4. Consequences:
   - Since C2 is true, C3 is true (C2 OR event1).
   - Therefore C4 (not C3) is false in every state.
   - So C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"") is false.
   - C6 is the implication (C5 -> event1). An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C6 is true.
   - C7 is the negation of C6, so C7 is false.

Thus C7 = False.
---
Step 1 — interpret the Ci:
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" ≡ ""Event1 happens"" (redundant).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" ≡ ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens"" ≡ ""Event1 eventually happens, or Event1 holds now.""
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" ≡ ""Not(event1 now) and not(event1 ever)"" — i.e. Event1 never happens.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" ≡ ""In the next state, Event1 never happens.""
- C6: ""If C5 holds, then event1 happens"" ≡ ""If (next state: Event1 never happens) then Event1 happens (now).""
- C7: ""C6 does not hold.""

Step 2 — use the context:
- Initially Event2 happened.
- After Event2, Event1 must happen. So because Event2 already occurred, Event1 must occur at some future point (i.e. Event1 eventually happens in every run).

Step 3 — consequences:
- C4 (Event1 never happens) is impossible under the context (because Event2 already occurred and forces Event1 eventually).
- Therefore C5 (""C4 in the next state"") is false — the antecedent of C6 cannot be true in any actual run.
- If the antecedent of an implication is impossible, the implication is vacuously true. So C6 holds.
- C7 asserts C6 does not hold; since C6 does hold, C7 is false.

Final answer: False
---
False.

Reasoning (at the initial state, where event2 has happened):
- C1 = ""event1 happens and event1 happens"" is equivalent to ""event1 happens"". At the initial state event1 has not yet happened, so C1 is false.
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"". Since after the initial state event1 will occur (at the next state), C1 does hold at that future state, so C2 is true.
- C3 = ""C2 holds or event1 happens"". C2 is true, so C3 is true.
- C4 = ""C3 does not hold"". Since C3 is true, C4 is false.
- C5 = ""C4 holds in the next state"". In the next state C3 is still true (and hence C4 is false), so C5 is false.
- C6 = ""If C5 holds, then event1 happens"". An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C6 is true (vacuously).
- C7 = ""C6 does not hold"". Because C6 is true, C7 is false."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 happens.
- After event2, event1 must happen → event1 does occur (immediately after the initial event2).
- After event1, event2 must happen → they alternate, so event1 does occur (at least once).

Thus ""Event1 does not happen"" is false.

Step 2 — translate the conditions
- C1: Event1 does not happen. → False.
- C2: Event1 does not happen. → False.
- C3: C1 and C2 → False ∧ False = False.
- C4: C3 does not hold → ¬False = True.
- C5: Event1 does not happen → False.
- C6: If C4 holds, then C5 holds → (C4 → C5). Since C4 is True and C5 is False, C6 is False.
- C7: C6 always holds → requires C6 to be true, but C6 is false.

Conclusion
C7 is False.
---
Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → event1 does happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen → they alternate, but crucially event1 does occur (given the initial event2).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1: Event1 does not happen. — False (context implies event1 does happen).
- C2: Event1 does not happen. — False (same as C1).
- C3: C1 holds and C2 holds. — False (both conjuncts are false).
- C4: C3 does not hold. — True (negation of a false statement).
- C5: Event1 does not happen. — False (same as C1/C2).
- C6: If C4 holds, then C5 holds. — This is C4 → C5. Since C4 is True and C5 is False, the implication is False.
- C7: C6 always holds. — C6 is false, so ""always holds"" is false.

Final answer: False

We are asked whether C7 is True or False.

Step-by-step:

- From the context: event2 happened initially, and after event2 event1 must happen. So event1 does happen (and events alternate thereafter).
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" — false.
- C2: same as C1 — false.
- C3: C1 and C2 — false (false ∧ false = false).
- C4: C3 does not hold — true (negation of false).
- C5: ""Event1 does not happen."" — false.
- C6: ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds."" C6 is (C4 → C5). Here C4 is true and C5 is false, so the implication is false.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" That asserts C6 is true; but C6 is false, so C7 is false.

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step

1) Interpret context as an alternating sequence starting at time 0:
- time 0: event1 happens (given).
- After event1 must come event2, so time 1: event2.
- After event2 must come event1, so time 2: event1.
- And so on: event1 at even times, event2 at odd times.

2) Evaluate the conditions at times t = 0,1,2,... using that schedule.
- C1: ""event1 and event1"" — simply true exactly when event1 holds (true at even times).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — false at any time, because C1 fails at the next time when event2 occurs. So C2 is false at all times.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — false at all times because C2 is false everywhere.
- C4: ""if event2 then C3"" — since C3 is always false, C4 is true at times when event2 is false (even times) and false at times when event2 is true (odd times).
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" — at time t this equals C4 at t+1, so C5 is true exactly at odd times (because C4 is true at even times).
- C6: ""C5 holds and event1 happens"" — requires event1 (even times) and C5 (odd times) simultaneously, which never occurs. So C6 is false at all times.
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state"" — false at all times because C6 is false everywhere.

3) Therefore C7 is False.

You are asking whether C7 is true in the initial state given the context (initially event1, and events alternate: after event1 comes event2, after event2 comes event1). Evaluate at the initial state s0 with the infinite trace: s0:event1, s1:event2, s2:event1, s3:event2, ...

1. C1 = (event1 and event1) — true at s0 (event1 holds), false at s1.
2. C2 = always C1 — false at s0, because C1 does not hold at s1 (events alternate).
3. C3 = (C2 holds in the next state) — at s0, this asks whether C2 is true at s1; C2 is false at s1, so C3 is false at s0.
4. C4 = (if event2 then C3) — at s0 event2 is false, so C4 is vacuously true at s0.
5. C5 = (C4 holds in the next state) — at s0 this asks whether C4 is true at s1. At s1, event2 is true but C3 at s1 is false (since C2 is always false), so C4 is false at s1. Thus C5 is false at s0.
6. C6 = (C5 and event1) — at s0 event1 is true but C5 is false, so C6 is false at s0.
7. C7 = (C6 holds in the next state) — at s0 this asks whether C6 is true at s1; C6 is false at s1 (event1 is false there), so C7 is false at s0.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
We must determine whether C7 (""C6 holds in the next state"") is true, given the context and the chain of conditions, starting from the initial state (where event1 happened).

Step 2 — the context (sequence of events)
- At the initial state s0: event1 happens.
- After any event1, event2 must happen next. So s1: event2 happens.
- After any event2, event1 must happen next. So s2: event1 happens.
Thus events alternate: s0: event1, s1: event2, s2: event1, s3: event2, …

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions step by step at the initial state s0

C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens.""
- At s0 event1 is true, so C1 is true at s0.

C2: ""C1 always holds.""
- This requires C1 to hold at every state from the current one onward.
- At s1 event2 holds, so C1 (which needs event1) is false at s1. Therefore C2 is false at s0.

C3: ""C2 holds in the next state.""
- That requires C2 to be true at s1. We already saw C2 is false at s1, so C3 is false at s0.

C4: ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds.""
- At s0 event2 does not happen, so the implication is vacuously true. Thus C4 is true at s0.

C5: ""C4 holds in the next state.""
- This requires C4 to be true at s1. At s1 event2 does happen, so for C4 at s1 we need C3 to hold at s1.
- C3 is ""C2 holds in the next state"" — that would require C2 at s2, but C2 is false (events alternate), so C3 is false at s1.
- Therefore C4 is false at s1, so C5 is false at s0.

C6: ""C5 holds and event1 happens.""
- At s0 event1 happens (true) but C5 is false, so C6 is false at s0.

C7: ""C6 holds in the next state.""
- This requires C6 to be true at s1. At s1 event1 does not happen (event2 happens), so C6 is false at s1 regardless of C5 there.
- Hence C7 is false at s0.

Step 1 — formalize:
- Let p = ""event1 happens now"" and q = ""event1 happens in the next state"".
- C1 = C2 = q. C3 = q. C4 = q or p. C5 = q. C6 = C4 or C5 = (q or p) or q = p or q.
- C7 = ""always C6"" = ""for every state, p or q holds in that state.""

Step 2 — use the context:
- Initially p holds (event1 happens).
- After event1, event2 must occur next, so in the next state q is false and instead event2 occurs.
- After event2 no other events can happen, so in the state where event2 occurs: p is false (event1 does not happen now) and q is false (event1 does not happen in the next state).

Step 3 — counterexample:
- In the state where event2 occurs, p or q is false, so C6 is false at that state. Therefore C6 is not true in all states.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — understand the scenario
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2 no other events can happen. (So no event1 can ever occur later.)
- Also, after event1 no other events can happen (irrelevant because event1 never happens in this run).

Step 2 — evaluate conditions in order (using standard temporal meaning: ""eventually"" = holds now or at some future point)
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" This is false (event1 never happens).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" False (C1 is false now and will never become true).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" True (because C2 is false).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" True (C3 is true now, so it eventually holds).
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" False (C4 is true).
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" True (C5 is false).
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" False (C6 is true).

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the situation
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So event1 never happens (no future state has event1).

Step 2 — evaluate conditions (take p = ""event1 holds at a state"")
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" = G p. Since p never holds, C1 = False.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" = F(G p). G p is false everywhere, so C2 = False.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" = not C2 = True.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" = F(C3). C3 is already true now, so C4 = True.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" = not C4 = False.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold"" = not C5 = True.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold"" = not C6 = False.

Final answer: False
---
We are asked whether C7 is True or False.

Interpretation from the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so the system remains in a state where event2 has happened and nothing else can occur).
- In particular, event1 will never happen (since it didn't happen initially and no further events can occur).

Now evaluate the conditions step by step:

- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" False — event1 never happens.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" False — C1 is false now and can never become true (no events will occur to change that).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" True — C2 is false, so its negation holds.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" True — C3 already holds, so it certainly eventually holds.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" False — C4 is true, so its negation is false.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" True — C5 is false, so its negation is true.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" False — C6 is true, so its negation is false.

Therefore C7 is False. Final answer:

Sample responses:
You ask whether C6 is true or false. We'll evaluate each condition given the context (event1 happens initially, event2 must happen after event1, and after event2 nothing else can happen).

1. From the context, event1 does happen, and event2 also happens (after event1).  
2. C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Since event2 does happen and event1 did happen earlier, the implication is satisfied. So C1 is True.  
3. C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is the negation of C1, so C2 is False.  
4. C3: same as C2, so C3 is also False.  
5. C4: ""Event1 happens and C3 holds."" Event1 happens (True) but C3 is False, so C4 is False.  
6. C5: ""C4 always holds."" C4 is not even true, so C5 is False.  
7. C6: ""C2 holds or C5 holds."" Both C2 and C5 are False, so their disjunction is False.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C6 (C2 holds or C5 holds) is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → event2 does occur, and only after event1.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Given the context event2 only happens after event1, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is true, C2 is false.
- C3: same as C2, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""Event1 happens and C3 holds."" Event1 does happen, but C3 is false, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" C4 is false, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C2 holds or C5 holds."" Both C2 and C5 are false, so C6 is false.

Final answer:
False

We want to know whether C6 (C2 holds or C5 holds) is true given the context.

Step 1 — facts from context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen ⇒ event2 does happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Step 2 — evaluate C1:
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" In the actual sequence event2 does happen and event1 did happen earlier, so C1 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C2 and C3:
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is true, C2 is false.
- C3 is the same as C2, so C3 is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C4 and C5:
- C4: ""Event1 happens and C3 holds."" Event1 happens (true) but C3 is false, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" Since C4 is false, C5 is false.

Step 5 — evaluate C6:
- C6 = C2 holds or C5 holds = false or false = false.

- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

From this: event1 has occurred and no further events can occur at any later time. In particular, event2 does not (and cannot) occur.

Step-by-step evaluation of the Ci:

- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" True (since event1 happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, so event2 cannot occur).

- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" True (event1 happened and C1 is True).

- C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" True (C2 holds, so the disjunction is True).

- C4: ""C3 always holds."" True. Because C2 is a global fact (event1 happened and event2 never happens) and no future events can change that, C3 holds at all times; so C3 always holds.

- C5: ""If event2 happens, then C4 holds."" True. The antecedent (""event2 happens"") is false in the actual timeline, so the implication is vacuously true. Even if considered counterfactually, C4 is already true, so the implication is true.

- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" False (because C5 holds).

- C7: ""C6 always holds."" False. C6 is false, so it cannot always hold.

Final answer: False
---
We are asked whether C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true.

1) From the context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. Therefore event2 does not happen. So C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is true.

2) C2 (""Event1 happens and C1 holds"") is true because event1 did happen and C1 holds.

3) C3 (""Event2 happens or C2 holds"") is true because C2 holds.

4) C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true: since no events can occur after the initial state, C3 holds in all (reachable) states.

5) C5 (""If event2 happens, then C4 holds"") is true because C4 is true (an implication with a true consequent is true).

6) C6 (""C5 does not hold"") is false because C5 does hold.

7) C7 (""C6 always holds"") is therefore false, since C6 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify goal:
- We must decide whether C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true.

Step 2 — use the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has happened, event2 cannot happen later.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Symmetric but irrelevant because event2 never occurs here.)

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" True, because event1 has happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" True (event1 did happen and C1 is true).
- C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" True (C2 holds).
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" True — C3 holds from the initial state and no events can change that.
- C5: ""If event2 happens, then C4 holds."" True — the antecedent (event2 happens) is false, so the implication is vacuously true.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" False, because C5 does hold.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" Since C6 is false, C7 is false.

Final answer:
False"

Answer: False

Reasoning:
1. From the context: initially event2 happened, and “after event2, event1 must happen.” Therefore event1 will occur at some future point. So C1 (""Event1 eventually happens"") is true.

2. C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"", i.e. eventually (event1 eventually happens). In temporal logic F(F p) is equivalent to F p, so C2 is equivalent to C1. Since C1 is true, C2 is true.

3. C3 is ""C2 does not hold"" = not C2. Since C2 is true, C3 is false.

4. C4 is the same as C1, so C4 is true.

5. C5 is C3 and C4 = false and true = false.

6. C6 is ""C5 eventually holds"" = eventually(false), which is false.

7. C7 is ""C6 holds in the next state"" = X C6. Since C6 is false, C7 is false.

Therefore C7 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked
C7 is ""C6 eventually holds"". We must decide whether that eventuality is satisfied given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
Starting state S0: event1 happened.
The rules force alternation: after any state where event1 happened, the next state has event2; after any state where event2 happened, the next state has event1. So the state sequence is event1 (S0), event2 (S1), event1 (S2), event2 (S3), … forever alternating.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" True at states where the current event is event1. In particular C1 is true at S0 (since S1 has event2) and false at states where the current event is event2.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" At a state with event1 (e.g. S0), C1 is true and event1 is true, so C2 is true. At a state with event2 (e.g. S1), C1 is false (next is event1) and event1 does not hold now, so C2 is false. Thus C2 holds exactly at the event1 states and fails at event2 states.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" This would require C2 to be true in every state, but C2 is false at every event2 state, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Since C3 is already false, C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" False (C4 never holds).
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" False.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" Since C6 is false in every state (there is no state where C6 becomes true), C7 is false.

Final answer
False
---
Reasoning:

- Let states be s0 (initial), s1, s2, ...
- s0: event1 holds (given).
- By the rules: after event1, event2 must happen, and after event2, event1 must happen. So the sequence of events is alternating:
  s0: event1, s1: event2, s2: event1, s3: event2, ... (repeat).

Evaluate the Ci in s0:

- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" At s0 this is true (s1 has event2).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" At s0 this is true (C1 is true).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" This requires C2 to hold at every state. Check s1: at s1, C1 is false (s2 has event1), and event1 is false at s1, so C2 is false at s1. Therefore C2 does not always hold, so C3 is false at s0.
- Once C3 is false, every condition that asserts C3 (or C3 always, or C4, C5, C6) is false at s0 or at relevant future states, and none of those can become true later.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" Since C6 is never true in any future state under the alternating sequence, C7 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
We are asked whether C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is true given the context (initially event1; after event1 event2 must happen; after event2 event1 must happen).

Step 2 — interpret the context and conditions
The context forces an alternating sequence of events:
- time 0: event1
- time 1: event2
- time 2: event1
- time 3: event2
- … and so on.

Interpret the Ci:
- C1: ""event2 happens in the next state"" (X event2).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens"" = (X event2) ∨ event1.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" = □C2 (C2 true at every time).
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" = □C3 (redundant nesting).
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" = X C4.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state"" = X X C4.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds"" = ◇(X X C4).

Step 3 — evaluate C2 along the timeline
At even times (0,2,4,...), event1 is true now, so C2 is true (because event1 now makes the disjunction true).

At odd times (1,3,5,...), event2 occurs now, so event1 now is false. Also at an odd time t, the next state t+1 is even and has event1, so ""event2 in the next state"" is false. Hence at odd times both disjuncts fail, so C2 is false at every odd time.

Step 4 — consequences for C3..C7
- C3 = □C2 is false because C2 is not true at every time (it fails at odd times).
- Therefore C4 (□C3) is false, C5 = X C4 is false at all times, C6 = X X C4 is false at all times.
- C7 = ""eventually C6"" is false because C6 never becomes true at any time.

Identify the hypothesis:
- We must decide whether C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true given the context and the listed conditions.

Understand the context:
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
Thus the execution alternates: event1, event2, event1, event2, ... so event1 does occur (initially and repeatedly).

Examine each condition:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Given the context, this is false (event1 happens initially).
- C2: same as C1, so false.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 is false at all times (event1 keeps occurring), C3 is false.
- C4: ""C1 holds and C3 holds."" Both conjuncts are false, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""Event1 does not happen."" Same as C1, false.
- C6: ""C4 holds or C5 holds."" Both disjuncts are false, so C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" Since C6 is false (it does not hold now or ever), C7 is false.

Conclusion:
False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Let ¬e1 mean “Event1 does not happen.” Then C1, C2, C5 are all ¬e1.
- From the context we have an alternating sequence: initially event1 occurs, then event2, then event1, then event2, … So event2 (hence ¬e1) occurs infinitely often and at every other step.
- C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is therefore true at every time, because from any time there will be a future time where ¬e1 holds (the next event2).
- C4 = C1 and C3 = ¬e1 and (true) = ¬e1.
- C6 = C4 or C5 = ¬e1 or ¬e1 = ¬e1. So C6 is equivalent to ¬e1.
- C7 says “C6 always holds,” i.e. G(¬e1) — event1 never happens. That contradicts the given that event1 happens initially (and repeatedly). Thus C7 is false (a counterexample is the initial state where event1 occurs, so C6/¬e1 does not hold there).
---
Goal: decide if C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true given the context.

1) Understand the context
- Initially event1 happens.
- After any event1, event2 must happen next.
- After any event2, event1 must happen next.
So the system produces an infinite alternating sequence: event1 at time 0, then event2, then event1, then event2, …

2) Translate the Ci statements (evaluated at the initial time)
- C1: ¬event1 (i.e. event1 does not happen now).
- C2: ¬event1 (same as C1).
- C3: F C2 (eventually C2 holds).
- C4: C1 ∧ C3.
- C5: ¬event1 (same again).
- C6: C4 ∨ C5.
- C7: G C6 (C6 holds at all times).

3) Evaluate them at the initial time (time 0)
- At time 0 event1 does happen, so ¬event1 is false. Therefore C1 = false, C2 = false, C5 = false.
- C3 = “eventually ¬event1” is true because at the next step (when event2 occurs) ¬event1 holds.
- C4 = C1 ∧ C3 = false ∧ true = false.
- C6 = C4 ∨ C5 = false ∨ false = false.
- C7 = G C6 requires C6 to hold at time 0 (and every time). But C6 is false at time 0, so G C6 is false.

Step 1 — interpret the context and ""eventually"":
- Initially event2 has happened (so event2 is true at the initial point).
- After event1, event2 must happen (irrelevant here because event1 is not asserted to occur).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so the trace has event2 at the start and then no further events/changes).
- Standard ""eventually"" (F) is satisfied if the formula holds at some point in the trace, including the current point.

Step 2 — evaluate each Ci at the initial point:

True

Reasoning (stepwise):

- Let t0 be the initial moment when event2 happened. After that (t1, t2, ...) no further events can occur.
- C1 = ""event2 eventually happens"": true at t0 (it already happened at t0). C2 is the same, so true at t0.
- C3 = ""eventually C2"": true at t0 because C2 holds at t0 (eventually includes the current moment).
- C4 = C1 and C3: true at t0 (both true).
- C5 = ""eventually C4"": true at t0 because C4 holds at t0.
- C6 = ""C5 does not hold"": false at t0 (since C5 is true at t0). However, at any future moment t ≥ t1, C1, C2, C3, C4, C5 are all false (event2 will not occur again, so the ""eventually"" statements referring to future occurrences fail), hence C6 is true at t1 and thereafter.
- C7 = ""eventually C6"": true at t0 because C6 becomes true at t1.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context and formulas
- Context: initially event1 happened. Also, after event1 no other events can happen. (So there is an initial occurrence of event1 and no further events occur afterward.)
- C1 and C6: ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" = at every state, event1 will eventually happen from that state.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"", C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"", C5: ""C4 does not hold"", C7: ""C5 and C6"".

Step 2 — evaluate C1 and C6
- Because event1 happens initially, ""event1 eventually happens"" is true in the initial state. So C1 is true. C6 is the same statement, so C6 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C2 (always C1)
- Consider a state after the initial event1. By the context, no further events occur, so from that later state there is no future occurrence of event1. Thus ""event1 eventually happens"" is false from that later state. Therefore C1 does not hold in every state, so C2 is false.

Step 4 — propagate truth values
- C2 is false ⇒ C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false.
- C3 false ⇒ C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is false.
- C4 false ⇒ C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is true.

Step 5 — combine for C7
- C5 is true and C6 is true, so C7 (C5 ∧ C6) is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C7 is the conjunction (C5 holds) and (C6 holds). We must decide whether C7 is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened (so at the initial state event1 has occurred).
- After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant here unless event2 occurs).
- After event1, no other events can happen (once event1 has happened, there are no future occurrences of any events, including event1).

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True at the initial state because event1 already happened (event1 occurs at or before the initial state).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" This means at every future state C1 must be true. But at any state after the initial one there are no further occurrences of event1 (because after event1 no other events can happen), so from those later states ""event1 eventually happens"" is false. Therefore C1 is not true at all future states, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is already false (at least at some state), C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" C3 is false, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is false, C5 is true.
- C6: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Same as C1, true at the initial state.
- C7: ""C5 holds and C6 holds."" Both are true, so C7 is true.

Conclusion
True
---
Answer: True

Reasoning step-by-step (evaluated at the initial state):

1. From the context: event1 occurs initially. Also, once event1 has happened no further events occur (event1 is terminal). And whenever event2 occurs it must be followed by event1 (irrelevant here because event2 does not occur).

2. C1 (event1 eventually happens): True at the initial state because event1 already happened.

3. C2 (always C1): This requires that at every future state, event1 is still guaranteed to happen eventually. But immediately after the initial event1 no further events can occur, so at the next state event1 will not occur in the future. Thus C1 is false at that next state, so C2 is false at the initial state.

4. C3 (C2 always holds): Since C2 is false, C3 is false.

5. C4 (C3 holds in the next state): False because C3 is false.

6. C5 (C4 does not hold): True because C4 is false.

7. C6 (event1 eventually happens): Same as C1, True at the initial state.

8. C7 (C5 and C6): True AND True = True.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- C1 is just ""event2 happens"" (the disjunction repeats the same atom), and by the context ""Initially, event2 happened"" C1 is true in the initial state.
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 already holds in the initial state, C2 is true.
- C3 is the same as C1, so C3 is true.
- C4 = (C2 → C3). With both C2 and C3 true, C4 is true in the initial state.
- C5 = ""C4 always holds."" Given the context ""After event2, no other events can happen,"" there is no further state in which C4 could fail; under standard temporal semantics a next-state does not exist after the terminal state and G(C4) is satisfied on the (finite) trace. Thus C5 is true.
- C6 = ""C5 holds in the next state."" Because there is no next state after the initial (event2) state, X C5 is false (next-state formulas are false at terminal states).
- C7 = ""C6 does not hold."" Since C6 is false, C7 is true.

Therefore C7 is True.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. C1 is ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"", which is just Event2 (a tautological duplicate). So C1 ≡ Event2.

2. The context says ""Initially, event2 happened."" So C1 is true at the initial state.

3. C2 is ""C1 eventually holds"" (F C1). Since C1 already holds initially, C2 is true at the initial state.

4. C3 is the same as C1 (Event2), so C3 is true at the initial state.

5. C4 is ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" At the initial state C2 is true and C3 is true, so C4 is true there. At any later state C2 would be false (no new events occur after event2), so the implication C4 is vacuously true there. Thus C4 holds at every state.

6. C5 is ""C4 always holds"" (G C4). From (5), C4 does indeed hold in all states, so C5 is true.

7. C6 is ""C5 holds in the next state."" Because C5 is a global truth, it still holds in the next state, so C6 is true.

8. C7 is ""C6 does not hold."" Since C6 is true, C7 is false.

Therefore the final answer is False.
---
Answering what C7 (""C6 does not hold"") is:

1) What is being asked: Is C7 true in the initial state?

2) Use the context:
   - Initially event2 happened (so event2 is true at the initial state).
   - After event2 no other events happen (so in every future state event2 is false).

3) Evaluate the conditions at the initial state and in futures:
   - C1: ""event2 happens or event2 happens"" — true at the initial state (event2 happened).
   - C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — true at the initial state because C1 already holds now.
   - C3: same as C1 — true at the initial state.
   - C4: ""If C2 holds then C3 holds"" — true at the initial state (true → true).
   - For any future state after the initial one: event2 is false, so C1 and C3 are false there; C2 (""eventually C1"") is false there too (event2 will not occur again). Thus in any future state the implication C4 is vacuously true (false → false is true). So C4 holds in every state.
   - C5: ""C4 always holds"" — true at the initial state (C4 holds in all states).
   - C6: ""C5 holds in the next state"" — true, since C5 holds in every state including the next one.
   - C7: ""C6 does not hold"" — false, because C6 does hold.

Goal: determine truth of C6.

Given context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.

From ""Initially event2 happened"" and ""after event2 no other events can happen"" we conclude:
- event2 has occurred.
- No other events (including event1) can ever occur later. So event1 did not and will not happen.

Evaluate conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" True (event2 happened).
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" False (event1 did not happen).
- C3: same as C2, so False.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" False, because C3 is false now and nothing can change (no events can occur), so C3 will never become true.
- C5: ""C2 holds or C4 holds."" False (both C2 and C4 are false).
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" False, because C5 is false now and cannot become true later (no events or changes possible).

Final answer: False

We are asked whether C6 (which says “C5 eventually holds”) is true given the context.

Step-by-step reasoning:

- Context: initially event2 happened. Also, after event2 no other events can happen (so once event2 has happened there will be no further events). After event1 no other events can happen as well.

- C1: “Event2 happens or event1 happens.” Since event2 already happened initially, C1 is true.

- C2: “Event1 happens and C1 holds.” This requires event1 to happen. Event1 did not happen initially, and because event2 already happened and no events can happen after event2, event1 cannot happen later. Therefore C2 is false (and cannot become true).

- C3: same as C2, so C3 is false and cannot become true.

- C4: “C3 eventually holds.” Since C3 will never hold (event1 cannot occur), C4 is false.

- C5: “C2 holds or C4 holds.” Both are false, so C5 is false and cannot become true.

- C6: “C5 eventually holds.” Because C5 is false now and can never become true under the given constraints, C6 is false.

Final answer:
False

The hypothesis asks whether C6 (""C5 eventually holds"") is true given the context.

From the context:
- Initially event2 happened. So event2 has happened now.
- After event2, no other events can happen. (So no future events can occur.)
- Also, after event1 no other events can happen (but that only matters if event1 ever occurs).

Evaluate the conditions:

- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" True, because event2 has happened initially.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" False, because event1 does not happen (event2 happened initially and no other events can happen afterward).
- C3: same as C2, so False.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" False — C3 is false now and cannot become true later because no further events can occur after event2.
- C5: ""C2 holds or C4 holds."" False (both disjuncts false).
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" False — C5 is false now and cannot become true later (no events can make C2 or C4 true).

Therefore C6 is False."

Sample responses:
You are asking whether C7 (""C6 does not hold"") is true.

Step-by-step:
- From the context: ""After event1, event2 must happen"" means the implication (event1 -> event2) holds. So C1, C2 and C4 (all the same implication) are true.
- C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true because C2 does hold given the context.
- C5 (""If C3 holds, then C4 holds"") is true (C3 is true and C4 is true).
- C6 (""C1 holds or C5 holds"") is therefore true (in fact both C1 and C5 hold).
- C7 asserts ""C6 does not hold"", which contradicts the above.

Final answer: False
---
You are asking whether C7 is true or false.

1. From the context: ""After event1, event2 must happen"" gives the implication event1 → event2. So C1, C2 and C4 (all the same conditional) are true under the context.
2. C3 says C2 always holds — given the context, that is true.
3. C5 is (C3 → C4). With C3 true and C4 true, C5 is true.
4. C6 is (C1 ∨ C5). Since C1 is true (and C5 is also true), C6 is true.
5. C7 is ""C6 does not hold"", i.e. ¬C6. Because C6 holds, C7 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Goal: decide whether C7 (""C6 does not hold"") is true or false.

1) From the context ""After event1, event2 must happen"" we get the implication If event1 then event2. That directly makes C1, C2 and C4 true (they are the same implication).

2) C3 says ""C2 always holds."" Given C2 is true from the context, C3 is true.

3) C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" Since C3 is true, C5 guarantees C4 — which in any case already holds.

4) C6 is ""C1 holds or C5 holds."" C1 holds, so C6 is true (disjunction true if either disjunct is true).

5) C7 asserts ""C6 does not hold."" But we have established C6 does hold, so C7 is false.

We treat the formulas with standard linear-time temporal semantics: ""eventually"" (F) can be satisfied at the current state, X is the next-state operator, and the trace is: at time 0 event1 occurs, and at every time >=1 no events occur.

1) C1 = ""event1 eventually happens"" (F event1). True at time 0 because event1 happened initially (F can be satisfied at the current state).

2) C2 = ""C1 always holds"" (G C1). This requires that at every state C1 holds. At time 1 and later, event1 never happens, so C1 is false there. Therefore C2 is false at time 0.

3) C3 = ""C2 holds in the next state"" (X C2). That asks whether C2 is true at time 1; as just argued, C2 is false at time 1. So C3 is false at time 0.

4) C4 = ""C3 does not hold"" (¬C3). Since C3 is false, C4 is true at time 0.

5) C5 = ""C4 holds in the next state"" (X C4). At time 1, C3 is false (same reasoning repeated for all later times), so C4 is true at time 1. Thus C5 is true at time 0.

6) C6 = ""C5 holds in the next state"" (X C5). At time 1, C5 is true (because C4 is true at time 2), so C6 is true at time 0.

7) C7 = ""C6 holds in the next state"" (X C6). At time 1, C6 is true (because C5 is true at time 2), so C7 is true at time 0.

Therefore C7 is True.

Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C7 is true or false given the context. C7 is ""C6 holds in the next state"" (i.e. X C6).

Step 2 — model the situation
- s0 = initial state: event1 has happened in s0.
- After event1 no other events can happen, so all future states s1, s2, ... have no further occurrences of event1 or event2.

Step 3 — interpret the Ci (temporal reading)
- C1 = ""event1 eventually happens"" (F event1).
  - At s0 this is true (event1 has already happened at s0).
  - At any later state si (i ≥ 1) this is false (event1 will not happen in the future).
- C2 = ""C1 always holds"" (G C1).
  - At s0: false, because at s1 C1 is false.
  - At s1 (and all later states): false (C1 is false there).
- C3 = ""C2 holds in the next state"" (X C2).
  - At s0: equals C2 at s1, which is false → C3 false at s0.
  - At s1: false as well.
- C4 = ""C3 does not hold"" (¬C3).
  - At s0: true (because C3 is false).
  - At s1: true.
- C5 = ""C4 holds in the next state"" (X C4).
  - At s0: equals C4 at s1, which is true → C5 true at s0.
  - At s1: true.
- C6 = ""C5 holds in the next state"" (X C5).
  - At s0: equals C5 at s1, which is true → C6 true at s0.
  - At s1: true.

Step 1 — what is asked
C7 says ""C6 always holds."" We must decide if that is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context and timeline
- Initially event1 has happened (call this state s0).
- After event1, event2 must happen, so event2 will occur in the next state (call it s1).
- After event2 nothing else can happen (s1 is terminal).

Step 3 — evaluate the Ci at s0 (initial state)
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" False (event2 must happen after event1).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" True (since C1 is false).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" False.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" True.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" False.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" We must check C5 at s1.

Step 4 — evaluate the Ci at s1 (where event2 has happened)
At s1 event2 has occurred, so the same pattern of truth values for C1–C5 repeats:
- C1 false, C2 true, C3 false, C4 true, C5 false.
Thus at s1, C5 is false. Therefore at s0, C6 (""C5 holds in the next state"") is false.

Step 5 — conclude about C7
C6 is false already at the initial state s0, so it is not true that C6 always holds. Therefore C7 is false.

False

Goal: decide whether C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is True or False given the context.

Context summary
- Initially event2 happens (at time t0).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 occurs at some later time t1 > t0).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step-by-step examination of the Ci

- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens.""
  - This matches the context directly. C1 is true.

- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds.""
  - Event2 does happen (at t0) and C1 holds, so C2 is true (true at t0).

- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens.""
  - Redundant with C2, also true (true at t0).

- C4: ""Event2 happens or C3 holds.""
  - Since event2 happens at t0, C4 is true at t0. (Both disjuncts require event2, so C4 is only true at times when event2 occurs.)

- C5: ""C4 eventually holds.""
  - At t0, C4 already holds, so ""eventually C4"" is true at t0. Thus C5 is true (at t0).

- C6: ""C5 always holds.""
  - This claims that at every time point, C5 (i.e., ""eventually C4"") holds.
  - After event1 (at times > t1) no further events occur, so C4 will never hold again in the future from those times. Therefore at times after t1, C5 is false. Hence C6 is false (it is not true at all times).

- C7: ""C6 eventually holds.""
  - Since C6 is false at t0 and remains false at all future times (it never becomes true), there is no time at which C6 holds. Therefore ""eventually C6"" is false.

False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. Therefore event1 does not happen.
- C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false.
- C2 (""C1 holds and event2 happens"") is false (because C1 is false), and C3 is the same so also false.
- C4 (""If C2 holds, then C3 holds"") is true, because the implication is vacuously true when C2 is false.
- C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true since C4 already holds.
- C6 (""C5 does not hold"") is false because C5 does hold.

Thus C6 is False.
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
We must decide whether C6 (""C5 does not hold"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 happened. That is the starting fact.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So once event2 has happened (which is immediately), no event1 can ever occur afterward.
- Also, after event1 no other events can happen (irrelevant here because event1 never occurs).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" False — event1 does not happen (event2 already happened initially and prevents any further events).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" False — C1 is false (even though event2 did happen).
- C3: same as C2, so False.
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" True — the implication is true (its antecedent C2 is false, so the implication holds).
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" True — C4 already holds now, so it does eventually hold.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" This is false because we just established C5 holds.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning, step by step:
- Initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen, so event1 cannot occur. Therefore C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false.
- C2 and C3 are C1 ∧ (event2 happens), so they are false because C1 is false.
- C4 is ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" This implication is vacuously true because C2 is false, so C4 is true.
- C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true because C4 already holds now, so it certainly holds eventually.
- C6 is ""C5 does not hold."" Since C5 is true, C6 is false."

Sample responses:
You are asking whether C7 (""If C1 holds, then C6 holds"") is true given the context. Step-by-step:

1. From the context: the system starts with event1, and then alternates event2, event1, event2, ... so event1 is true in the initial state (and in every other state).

2. Simplify the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — this just means event1 holds in the current state.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 ≡ event1.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" → C3 ≡ ¬event1.
- C4: ""Event1 happens or C3 holds"" → event1 ∨ ¬event1, which is a tautology (always true).
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" → since C4 is always true, C5 is always false.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state"" → false (C5 is false in every state, so C6 is false in every state).
- C7: ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds"" → C1 → C6.

3. Evaluate C7 in the initial state: C1 is true (event1 holds initially), but C6 is false. Therefore C1 → C6 is false in the initial state.

Conclusion: C7 is False.
---
The hypothesis asks whether C7 (""If C1 holds, then C6 holds"") is true given the context.

Step-by-step reasoning:

- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" simplifies to: Event1 happens (i.e. C1 ≡ event1).
- C2 is identical to C1, so C2 ≡ event1.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" ≡ not event1.
- C4: ""Event1 happens or C3 holds"" ≡ event1 or (not event1) ≡ a tautology (always true).
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" is the negation of a tautology, so C5 is always false (in every state).
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state"" thus is always false (since C5 is false in every state).
- C7: ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds""—this is false whenever C1 is true but C6 is false.

Given the context, event1 does happen (initially and repeatedly), so there are states where C1 is true while C6 is always false. Therefore the implication in C7 fails.

Final answer: False
---
Task: determine whether C7 (If C1 holds, then C6 holds) is True or False.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" ≡ Event1 happens (redundant conjunction).
- C2: same as C1 ≡ Event1 happens.
- C3: C2 does not hold ≡ not Event1.
- C4: Event1 happens or C3 holds ≡ Event1 or not Event1 ≡ tautology (always True).
- C5: C4 does not hold ≡ False (since C4 is always True).
- C6: C5 holds in the next state ≡ next(False) ≡ False (C5 is false in every state, so it is false in the next state).
- C7: ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds"" is therefore Event1 ⇒ False. That implication is false whenever C1 (Event1) holds.

From the context, the initial state has Event1, so C1 is true while C6 is false; thus the implication C7 is false.

Sample responses:
The hypothesis asks whether the statement C7 is true given the context.

Context facts:
- Initially event2 happened (so event2 is true).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so event1 does not happen after the initial event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen.

Evaluate conditions step by step:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is equivalent to ""event2 happens"", which is true (given).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" C1 is true but event1 does not happen (because event2 occurred and prevents further events), so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is false, C3 is false.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens."" C3 is false, so this implication is true (a false antecedent makes the implication true).
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" C4 holds, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" C5 is false, so C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" C6 is false, so C7 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context: event2 happens initially, and after event2 no other events can happen. So event1 does not and cannot happen.
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" is equivalent to ""event2 happens"" — True (holds).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Antecedent C1 is True but event1 does not happen, so C2 is False.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Because C2 is False, C3 is False.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens."" C3 is False, so this implication is vacuously True.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" But C4 is True, so C5 is False.
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" C5 is False, so C6 is False.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" Since C6 is False, C7 is False.

Therefore C7 is False.
---
Step 1 — facts from context
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 is true.
- After event2, no other events can happen. Since event2 happened initially, event1 cannot happen (event1 is false).

Step 2 — evaluate conditions
- C1 (""event2 or event2""): true (because event2 is true).
- C2 (""if C1 then event1""): since C1 is true, C2 is equivalent to event1 — but event1 is false, so C2 is false.
- C3 (""C2 always holds""): false (C2 is false).
- C4 (""if C3 then event2""): antecedent C3 is false, so the implication C4 is true (a material implication with false antecedent is true).
- C5 (""C4 does not hold""): false (because C4 is true).
- C6 (""C5 always holds""): false (C5 is false).
- C7 (""C6 always holds""): false (C6 is false).

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Set up the timeline from the context:
   - s0 (initial): event1 happened.
   - s1 (next): event2 happens (because after event1, event2 must happen).
   - s2 and onward: no events happen (because after event2 no other events can happen).

2. Interpret statements in standard state-based temporal terms:
   - ""happens"" means true in the current state.
   - ""next"" means the usual X (true in the immediate successor state).
   - ""eventually"" means F (true at some state ≥ current).
   - ""always"" means G (true at all states ≥ current).

3. Evaluate the Ci’s (at the initial state s0, unless otherwise noted):
   - C1 = X(event2). At s0, event2 is true at s1, so C1 is True.
   - C2 = event2 ∧ C1. This requires event2 true in the same state and C1 true there. At s0 event2 is false, at s1 C1 (X event2) is false (event2 does not occur at s2). So C2 is False in every state.
   - C3 = F(C2). Since C2 never holds, C3 is False.
   - C4 = X(C3). C3 is false in every state, so C4 is False.
   - C5 = F(C4). C4 never holds, so C5 is False.
   - C6 = not C5. Since C5 is False, C6 is True (in every state).
   - C7 = G(C6). Because C6 is true in all states, C7 is True.

Hence C7 is True.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
First, interpret the context:
- event1 happened initially (so at the initial moment C1/C2-type facts about event1 are true).
- after event1 no other events can happen (so nothing changes after the initial moment).
- the requirement ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 can never occur once event1 has happened.

Now examine the conditions:

- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" True at the initial moment.
- C2: same as C1, also true initially.
- C3: C1 holds or C2 holds. True (since C1 and C2 hold).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Since C3 is true at the initial moment, C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" False (because C4 does hold).
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" False, because C5 is false now and, with no further events possible, will never become true.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" False, because C6 does not hold.

Therefore C7 is False.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
We must decide whether C6 is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
""Initially, event2 happened."" So event2 does happen. Also ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Thus no other events can occur after event2. (Whether event1 happened before is irrelevant because the statement explicitly says event2 happened.)

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This contradicts the context (event2 does happen), so C1 is False.
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" That requires event2 to happen and not happen simultaneously — impossible. C2 is False.
- C3: ""Event2 happens and C2 holds."" C2 is False, so C3 is False.
- C4: ""C3 holds and event2 happens."" C3 is False, so C4 is False.
- C5: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" Same as C2, so False.
- C6: ""C4 holds or C5 holds."" Both C4 and C5 are False, so their disjunction is False.

Evaluate each condition:

- C6: ""C4 holds or C5 holds."" False (both C4 and C5 are false).

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning:

- C2 = (event2 happens) AND C1. Since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3 = (event2 happens) AND C2. C2 is false, so C3 is false.

Sample responses:
We must decide whether C7 (C1 and C6) is true given the scenario.

1) Timeline from the context:
- Initially event2 occurred (state s0).
- After event2, event1 must happen (state s1).
- After event1, no further events can happen (state s2).
So the sequence contains event2 only at s0, then event1 at s1, then no events at s2.

2) Evaluate C1, C2, C3:
- Each of C1, C2, C3 says “Event2 always happens” (i.e., at every state). That is false, because event2 occurs at s0 but not at s1 or s2. So C1, C2, C3 are false.

3) C4: “C3 holds in the next state.” Since C3 is false at all states, C4 is false.

4) C5: “If C2 holds, then C4 holds.” An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C5 is true at every state (because C2 is false everywhere).

5) C6: “C5 always holds.” Since C5 is true at every state, C6 is true.

6) C7: C1 and C6. C1 is false and C6 is true, so the conjunction is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C7 (C1 ∧ C6) is true given the described event scenario.

Step 2 — interpret the context and the Ci
- Context: initially event2 occurs; after that event1 must occur; after event1 no other events can occur. So event2 happens at the initial state, but it does not hold at all later states.
- Interpretations of the Ci (standard temporal reading):
  - C1, C2, C3: ""event2 always happens"" (G event2).
  - C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" (X G event2).
  - C5: ""If C2 holds then C4 holds"" (C2 → C4).
  - C6: ""C5 always holds"" (G(C2 → C4)).
  - C7: ""C1 and C6 hold"" (G event2 ∧ G(C2 → C4)).

Step 3 — evaluate each needed part
- C1 (G event2): false, because event2 only holds initially and does not hold at the later states (event1 happens after the initial state, and after that no other events occur).
- C2 (G event2) and C3 (G event2): likewise false at every state in this model.
- C4 (X G event2): false at a state where the next state does not satisfy G event2 (here the next states do not satisfy G event2).
- C5 (C2 → C4): at any state the antecedent C2 is false (G event2 does not hold anywhere), so the implication C2 → C4 is true (vacuously).
- C6 (G(C2 → C4)): since C2 → C4 is true in every state, C6 is true.

Step 4 — combine for C7
- C7 = C1 ∧ C6 = (false) ∧ (true) = false.

Final answer:
False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning, step by step:

- Timeline from the context: state S0 (initial) has event2. After that event1 must occur in the next state S1. After event1 no other events occur (S1 is terminal/no further states with new events).

Step 1 — what’s given:
- Context: event1 happened. After event1 no other events can happen, so event2 did not happen.
- Treat each Ci as a material implication or proposition to be evaluated.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition (with event1 = True, event2 = False):

- C1: (event1 → event2). Since event1 is True and event2 is False, C1 is False.
- C2: (event1 → C1). event1 True and C1 False ⇒ C2 is False.
- C3: (C2 → event1). C2 is False ⇒ C3 is True (false antecedent makes implication true).
- C4: same as C1 ⇒ False.
- C5: (C3 → C4). C3 True and C4 False ⇒ C5 is False.
- C6: (event1 → C5). event1 True and C5 False ⇒ C6 is False.

Step 3 — evaluate C7:
- C7 is (event1 happens) AND (C6 holds). event1 is True but C6 is False ⇒ C7 is False.

Final answer:
False
---

False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- From the context, event1 happened (true) and after event1 no other events can happen, so event2 did not happen (false).
- C1 (if event1 then event2): since event1 is true but event2 is false, C1 is false.
- C2 (if event1 then C1): event1 is true but C1 is false, so C2 is false.
- C3 (if C2 then event1): the consequent (event1) is true, so C3 is true.
- C4 is the same as C1, so C4 is false.
- C5 (if C3 then C4): C3 is true, but C4 is false, so C5 is false.
- C6 (if event1 then C5): event1 is true but C5 is false, so C6 is false.
- C7 is ""event1 happens and C6 holds"": that's true AND false, hence false.

Therefore C7 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s asked
C5 is (C3 or C4). Both C3 and C4 assert “C2 does not hold.” So we just need to decide whether C2 is false; if so, C5 is true.

Step 2 — interpret the context and each condition
- Context: Initially event2 happened. After event2, no other events can happen. Also “After event1, event2 must happen” matches C1.
- C1: “If event1 happens, then event2 happens.” This is true (it restates the given rule).
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” That asserts that in the immediate successor state of the initial state, C1 is true.
- But because event2 already happened initially and no further events can happen after event2, there is no next state (so a claim of the form “holds in the next state” is false).
  Therefore C2 is false.
- C3 and C4: both say “C2 does not hold” — since C2 is false, C3 and C4 are both true.

Step 3 — conclude C5
C5 = C3 or C4 is therefore true.

Answer: True
---
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks
- C5 is (C3 or C4). Both C3 and C4 state the same thing: ""C2 does not hold."" So C5 is equivalent to ""C2 does not hold"" (i.e., ¬C2).

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This matches the context rule ""After event1, event2 must happen."" So C1 is true in the current (and general) situation.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" We must decide whether there is a next state and whether C1 holds there.

Step 3 — trace events and states
- Initially event2 happened.
- The context also says, ""After event2, no other events can happen."" That makes the state after the initial event2 terminal: there are no successor states (no next state).

Step 4 — evaluate C2 and thus C5
- Because there is no next state, the claim ""C1 holds in the next state"" is false (there is no next state in which to evaluate C1). So C2 is false.
- Therefore C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true (and so is C4). Hence C5 = (C3 or C4) is true.

Final answer: True
---
We want to know whether C5 (""C3 holds or C4 holds"") is true.

- C1 (""If event1 happens, then event2 happens"") is exactly the given rule ""After event1, event2 must happen,"" so C1 is true.
- C2 (""C1 holds in the next state""): the rule is a global/ongoing constraint, so it still holds in the next state. Even if in the next state no events can occur (so event1 cannot occur), the implication in C1 is vacuously true there. Thus C2 is true.
- C3 and C4 both assert ""C2 does not hold"" — since C2 is true, C3 and C4 are both false.
- Therefore C5 = (C3 or C4) = (false or false) = false.

Step 1 — what is being asked
You must decide whether C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true given the context and the chain of conditions C1–C6.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so whenever event1 occurs, the next state has event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so whenever event2 occurs, the next state has event1).

From these rules we get an alternating sequence of events starting with event2:
state0: event2
state1: event1
state2: event2
state3: event1
... and so on. Thus event2 does not occur in every state (it occurs exactly in the even states).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" This asserts event2 in every state. That is false (event2 is absent in odd states).
- C2: same as C1, also false.
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" Since C2 is false, C3 is false (even if event1 occurs in some states, the conjunction with false is false).
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" True, because C3 is false.
- C5: ""C1 holds and C4 holds."" C1 is false and C4 is true, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" Since C5 is false in every state, C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" C6 is false, so C7 is false.

Final answer
False
---
You ask whether C7 is true. Brief, non-sensitive reasoning:

- Context: initially event2; after event2, event1 must occur; after event1, event2 must occur. That enforces that event1 does occur sometime after the initial event2 (they must alternate), so event2 cannot hold at every state.
- C1 and C2 assert “event2 always happens” — these contradict the alternation requirement, so C1/C2 are false.
- C3 = (event1 happens) AND C2. Event1 does happen, but C2 is false, so C3 is false.
- C4 = not C3, so C4 is true.
- C5 = C1 AND C4 requires C1 true, but C1 is false, so C5 is false.
- C6 requires C5 in the next state, so C6 is false.
- C7 = “C6 always holds” is therefore false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s asked
- The hypothesis asks whether C7 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the context and each condition
- Context: initially event2 happened. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, no other events can happen.
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is equivalent to ""Event2 happens."" That is true at the initial state (given by the context).
- C2: same as C1, so true at the initial state.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" This claims C2 is true at every point in the timeline. But after the initial state, event1 must happen, and once event1 has happened no other events (including event2) occur there. So there are later states where ""event2 happens"" (C2) is not true. Therefore C3 is false.
- C4: ""C1 holds and C3 holds."" Since C3 is false, C4 is false.

---
Goal: decide whether C7 is True or False.

1) Identify the question
- We must evaluate whether C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true given the context about events.

2) Understand the context and each condition
- Context: initially event2 happened. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, no other events can happen. So the actual timeline is: event2 occurs, then event1 occurs, then the execution stops (no further events).
- C1 and C2: both state ""event2 happens"" (redundant). These are true at the initial moment.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" means C2 must be true at all times (globally).
- C4: ""C1 holds and C3 holds"" — requires both C1 (true initially) and C3 (global) to be true.
- C5: ""C4 always holds"" — C4 must be true at every time point.
- C6: ""C5 always holds"" — and so on.
- C7: ""C6 always holds"" — the final claim.

3) Trace and reason through the sequence
- At the initial moment event2 is true, so C1 and C2 are true initially.
- But after the initial moment, event1 must occur and then no further events occur. At the moment after event1, event2 is not happening. Therefore C2 is not true at that later time.
- Because C2 fails at some time, C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false.
- If C3 is false, then C4 (C1 AND C3) is false. If C4 is false at some time, then C5 (""C4 always holds"") is false, and the falsity propagates: C6 and C7 are false.

4) Conclusion
- C7 is False.

Final answer: False
---
We want to know whether C7 is true given the scenario:

Context timeline
- t0: initially event2 happens.
- After event2 (so by t1): event1 must happen.
- After event1 (t1), no further events can occur.

Evaluate the conditions step by step
- C1 = ""event2 happens and event2 happens"" — equivalent to ""event2 happens"". This is true at t0.
- C2 is the same as C1, so C2 is true at t0.
- C3 = ""C2 always holds"" (globally true at every time). This fails: at t1 event1 happens and event2 does not happen then, so C2 is false at t1; therefore C3 is false.
- C4 = ""C1 holds and C3 holds"". C1 is true but C3 is false, so C4 is false.
- C5 = ""C4 always holds"". Since C4 is already false at t0, C5 is false.
- C6 = ""C5 always holds"". C5 is false, so C6 is false.
- C7 = ""C6 always holds"". C6 is false, so C7 is false.

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. The hypothesis to decide is C7: ""C6 eventually holds.""

2. From the context:
   - Initially, event1 happened.
   - After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has occurred, no further events — including event2 — can occur.)

3. Examine C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens.""
   - Event1 does happen (initially). Because no other events can happen after event1, event2 cannot happen. Therefore the implication in C1 is false (the antecedent is true but the consequent is false).

4. C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false (it already fails at the initial point), C2 is false.

5. C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is false, C3 is false.

6. C4: ""C3 always holds."" Since C3 is false, C4 is false.

7. C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" C4 is already false and, with no further events or changes possible, it cannot become true at any future time; so C5 is false.

8. C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" Since C5 is false and cannot become true, C6 is false.

9. C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" Since C6 is false and cannot become true, C7 is false.

Therefore C7 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- Initially event1 happened. The context says that after event1 no other events can happen, so event2 does not happen at any time.
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Since event1 did happen but event2 does not, C1 is false.
- C2 = ""C1 always holds"" is false because C1 is already false now. Similarly every further ""always"" (C3, C4 ...) is false.
- C5 = ""C4 eventually holds"" is false because C4 is never true; hence C6 and then C7 (nested eventualities) are also false.

Therefore C7 is False.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. The context gives two global rules:
   - After event1, event2 must happen (so whenever event1 occurs, event2 will follow).
   - After event2, event1 must happen (so whenever event2 occurs, event1 will follow).
   These are invariant rules that hold for all states; also initially event2 happened, which is consistent with these rules.

2. C1, C2, C3 are identical: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" That is exactly the first global rule, so C1, C2, C3 hold.

3. C4 = (C2 or C3). Since both C2 and C3 hold, C4 holds.

4. C5 = (C1 and C4). With C1 and C4 true, C5 holds.

5. C6 = ""C5 always holds."" Because the underlying rules are global invariants, C5 holds in every state; therefore C6 is true.

6. C7 = ""C6 holds in the next state."" If C6 holds (i.e., C5 holds always), it holds in every state including the next one. Thus C7 is true.

Therefore C7 is True.
---

---
Step 1 — what's asked
We must decide whether C7 (""C6 holds in the next state"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context and each condition
- Context: initially event2 happened. Two global rules: (R1) after event1, event2 must happen; (R2) after event2, event1 must happen.
- C1, C2, C3 are all the same: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Each is therefore entailed by R1.
- C4 = C2 or C3. Since both C2 and C3 hold, C4 holds.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret the context
- The system starts with event2 at the initial state.
- After any event2, event1 must occur in the next state.
- After any event1, event2 must occur in the next state.
So the states alternate: s0: event2, s1: event1, s2: event2, s3: event1, … (event2 on even states, event1 on odd states).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions one by one
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p), so C1 is true at every state.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 holds now (and everywhere), C2 is true at every state.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" C2 already holds everywhere, so C3 is true at every state.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Because C3 holds everywhere, C4 is true at every state.
- C5: ""Event2 happens and C4 holds."" C4 holds everywhere, so C5 is true exactly at states where event2 happens — i.e., at even states s0, s2, s4, …
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" For a state s this is true iff C5 holds at s+1. Since C5 holds at even states, C6 holds at the states whose next state is even — i.e. at odd states s1, s3, s5, …
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" This requires C6 to hold at every state. But C6 fails at even states (e.g. s0): s0's next state s1 is event1, so C5 does not hold at s1, so C6 is false at s0. Thus C6 is not true in all states.

Step 3 — conclusion
C7 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Identify the question
- We must decide whether C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true given the context and the chain of conditions C1–C6.

Understand the context
- Initial state: event2 happened.
- Transition rules: after event2, event1 must happen (in the next state). After event1, event2 must happen (in the next state).
- So states alternate: initial state has event2, next state has event1, next has event2, and so on.

Examine the conditions step by step
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is trivially true (a tautology) in any state where it's evaluated.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 holds now (and at every state), C2 holds.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" C2 holds, so C3 holds.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 already holds, so C4 holds.
- C5: ""Event2 happens and C4 holds."" At the initial state event2 does happen and C4 holds, so C5 is true at the initial state.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" Look at the next state (the one after the initial): by the rules, that next state has event1 (not event2). C5 requires event2 to hold in that state, so C5 is false in the next state. Therefore C6 is false at the initial state.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" Because C6 is already false at the initial state, C7 does not hold.

Conclusion
- C7 is False.
---
Goal: decide whether C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true under the given context.

Context summary: initially event2 occurred; after any event2 the next state has event1; after any event1 the next state has event2. So states alternate: ... event2, event1, event2, event1, ...

Step-by-step evaluation of the Ci at the initial state:

- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology and holds in every state.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 already holds now (and everywhere), C2 holds.
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" C2 holds, so C3 holds.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 already holds, so C4 holds.
- C5: ""Event2 happens and C4 holds."" At the initial state event2 does happen and C4 holds, so C5 holds at the initial state.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" Check the next state: by the context, the next state has event1 (not event2). Although C4 (and the other Ci based on C1/C2) still hold there, C5 requires event2 to hold in that next state, which it does not. Therefore C5 is false in the next state, so C6 is false at the initial state.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" Because C6 is already false at the initial state, C7 does not hold.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. So there are no further states/transitions possible; event2 can never occur.

2. C1 and C2 (""Event2 eventually happens"") are therefore false.

3. C3 (C1 and C2) is false (false ∧ false = false).

4. C4 (C3 holds in the next state) is false because there is no next state after the initial state where C3 could hold.

5. C5 (Event2 eventually happens) is false for the same reason as C1/C2.

6. C6 (""If event2 happens, then C5 holds"") is true: an implication with a false antecedent (event2 never happens) is vacuously true.

7. C7 (C4 and C6) is false ∧ true = false.

Therefore C7 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Context facts:
   - Initially event1 happened.
   - After event1, no other events can happen.
   - (Also: after event2 no other events can happen, but that is moot if event2 never occurs.)

2. Consequence: because event1 has happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, event2 cannot occur at any later time. So ""event2 eventually happens"" is false.

3. Evaluate conditions:
   - C1: Event2 eventually happens — false.
   - C2: Event2 eventually happens — false.
   - C3: C1 and C2 — false AND false = false.
   - C4: C3 holds in the next state — there is no next state after event1 (no further events), so C3 does not hold in any next state; C4 is false.
   - C5: Event2 eventually happens — false.
   - C6: If event2 happens, then C5 holds — implication with a false antecedent is true (event2 does not happen), so C6 is true.
   - C7: C4 and C6 — false AND true = false.

Therefore C7 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. From the context: event1 happens initially, and after event1 no other events can happen. Since event1 already occurred initially, no events (including event2) can ever occur in any future state.
2. C1 and C2 assert ""event2 eventually happens."" Given (1), both C1 and C2 are false.
3. C3 is C1 and C2, so C3 is false.
4. C4 asserts C3 holds in the next state; since C3 is false, C4 is false.
5. C5 is the same as C1 (event2 eventually happens), so C5 is false.
6. C6 is ""if event2 happens, then C5 (event2 eventually happens) holds."" This implication is true: either event2 never happens (implication vacuously true) or if it happens then it trivially ensures ""eventually event2."" So C6 is true.
7. C7 is C4 and C6. C4 is false, C6 is true, so their conjunction C7 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — interpret context
- Initially event1 happened. Also ""after event1, event2 must happen"" and ""after event2, event1 must happen."" Starting from the initial event1, this forces an alternating sequence: event1, then event2, then event1, then event2, ... So both event1 and event2 do occur (indeed repeatedly).

Step 2 — evaluate conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" True (event1 already happened).
- C2: same as C1. True.
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" Whenever event2 happens, C2 (event1 or event2) is true. So C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Given C3 is true in the situation, C4 holds (true).
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" This contradicts C4, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 holds and event2 happens."" Since C5 is false, C6 is false (false AND anything = false).

Step 3 — evaluate C7
- C7: ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds."" C1 is true, C6 is false, so the implication is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
- We must decide whether C7 (""If C1 holds, then C6 holds"") is true or false given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — evaluate conditions from the context
- Context guarantees event1 happens initially, and the rules imply event1 and event2 occur (and keep occurring) — in particular event1 does happen, so:
  - C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" — True (event1 happens).
  - C2: same as C1 — True.
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" — True, because if event2 happens then ""event1 or event2"" is true (event2 makes C2 true).
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" — True, since C3 is a logical truth in this setting.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" — False (it contradicts C4).
- C6: ""C5 holds and event2 happens."" — False, because C5 is false (false AND anything is false).

Step 3 — evaluate C7
- C7 is ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds."" C1 is true, C6 is false, so the implication is false (true implies false = false).

Final answer
False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- C7 is the conditional: If C1 holds then C6 holds. We must decide whether C7 is true or false given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — evaluate the facts from the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → event2 happens at some later time.
- After event2, event1 must happen → event1 happens again later, and the two alternate; in particular both event1 and event2 do happen.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""event1 happens or event2 happens."" Given both events do occur, C1 is true.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" Whenever event2 happens, C2 (""event1 or event2"") is true (because event2 is true), so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Since C3 is true at all times (it is true whenever event2 happens and true when it does not), C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" This is the negation of C4, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 holds and event2 happens."" Because C5 is false, C6 is false (false AND true = false).

Step 4 — evaluate C7
- C7 says: if C1 then C6. We have C1 true and C6 false, so the implication is false.

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

1. C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p), so C1 is True.

2. C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is True, C2 is False.

3. C3: ""C2 does not hold."" C2 is False, so its negation is True; C3 is True.

4. C4: ""C1 does not hold."" C1 is True, so C4 is False.

5. C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" C3 is True but C4 is False, so C5 is False.

6. C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" From the context, initially event1 happened and after event1 no other events can happen — there is no next state where properties could hold. Even ignoring that, C5 is False in the current state, so it cannot become true in a (nonexistent) next state. Therefore C6 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify what's being asked
- We must evaluate C6 (""C5 holds in the next state"") given the context and the definitions of C1–C5. The final answer must be either True or False.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition in the initial state
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p), so C1 is True.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is True, C2 is False.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" C2 is False, so C3 is True.
- C4: ""C1 does not hold."" C1 is True, so C4 is False.
- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" That is True and False, so C5 is False.

Step 3 — consider the temporal aspect for C6
- C6 asserts that C5 holds in the next state. But the context states: ""Initially, event1 happened. After event1, no other events can happen."" That means there is no next state after the initial state. Even ignoring the lack of a next state, C5 is already False in any state, so it cannot become True in a next state.

Conclusion
- C6 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen → the initial state is terminal (there is no reachable successor state where any event occurs).
- After event2, no other events can happen — irrelevant because event2 never occurs (no state after initial has event2).

Conclusion: event2 never happens and there is no next state after the initial state.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions in the initial (and only) state
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (P → P) and is true in the current state. So C1 holds.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 holds, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" C2 is false, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C1 does not hold."" Same as C2, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" True ∧ False = False. So C5 is false in the initial state.

Step 3 — evaluate C6: ""C5 holds in the next state""
- There is no next state (initial state is terminal because after event1 no other events can happen), so ""C5 holds in the next state"" is false (next-state formulas fail when no next state exists).
- Even if one attempted to imagine a next state, C5 is already false in the only state and the logical ingredients (C1–C4) would not change to make C5 true.

We must decide whether C6 (""C5 does not hold"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — use the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1 no other events can happen. Therefore event2 does not happen (ever).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" True (by the second context statement).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" True, because after event1 no events (including event2) can occur, so in the next state event2 still does not happen.
- C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" True: event1 did happen and C2 holds, so the implication is satisfied.
- C4: ""C1 holds in the next state."" This is identical to C2, so True.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" Both C3 and C4 are true, so the implication C5 is true.

Final answer:
False
---
Goal: determine truth of C6 (""C5 does not hold"").

1. From context: initially event1 happened. After event1, no other events can happen. So event2 does not happen in the initial and in any subsequent state.
2. C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") — True.
3. C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") — True, because after event1 no further events occur, so in the next state event2 still does not happen.
4. C3 (""If event1 happens, then C2 holds"") — True (event1 did happen and it implies C2).
5. C4 (""C1 holds in the next state"") — same as C2, True.
6. C5 (""If C3 holds, then C4 holds"") — True, since C3 is true and C4 is true (true → true = true).
7. C6 (""C5 does not hold"") — False, because C5 does hold.

Final answer: False
---
Goal: determine truth of C6 (""C5 does not hold"").

Step 1 — understand context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 occurs, event2 cannot occur afterward.
- After event2, no other events can happen (not needed here because event2 does not occur given event1 happened first).

Step 2 — evaluate conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Given event1 happened initially and no events can happen after event1, event2 does not happen. So C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" After the initial state (where event1 happened) there are no further events, so C1 (event2 does not happen) still holds in the next state. So C2 is true.
- C3: ""If event1 happens, then C2 holds."" Event1 does happen, and C2 holds, so this implication is true (and in general follows from the context). So C3 is true.
- C4: ""C1 holds in the next state."" This is the same as C2, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" C3 is true and C4 is true, so the implication C5 is true.

Step-by-step:

1. From ""Initially, event1 happened"" we know event1 happens, so C1 (""event1 or event2"") is true.  
2. C2 is the same as C1, so C2 is true.  
3. C3 = ""C2 does not hold"" is therefore false.  
4. C4 = ""C3 holds or event2 happens"" reduces to ""event2 happens"" (since C3 is false). Given ""After event1, event2 must happen"" and event1 did happen initially, event2 does occur at some point, so C4 is true at least at the times when event2 happens.  
5. C5 = ""C4 always holds"" is false (C4 does not hold at all times, because C3 is false and event2 is not true at every instant).  
6. C6 = ""C1 holds or C5 holds"" is true because C1 already holds.  
7. C7 = ""C6 does not hold"" is therefore false.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. From the context: event1 happened initially. The rules make event2 happen after event1, and event1 happen after event2, so both events do occur (event2 will occur after the initial event1).
2. C1: ""event1 or event2"" — True (event1 did happen).
3. C2: same as C1 — True.
4. C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — False.
5. C4: ""C3 holds or event2 happens"" — True, because event2 does happen.
6. C5: ""C4 always holds"" — whether this is true or false is irrelevant for the final result.
7. C6: ""C1 holds or C5 holds"" — True, because C1 is True.
8. C7: ""C6 does not hold"" — False (since C6 holds).

Therefore C7 is False.
---
Identify what is asked
- C7 is ""C6 does not hold"" (i.e., C7 = ¬C6). We must decide if C7 is true or false given the context.

Evaluate the conditions step by step
1. Context: initially event1 happened. Also, after event1 event2 must happen, and after event2 event1 must happen. So at least event1 occurs (initially) and event2 will occur (after that).
2. C1 = (event1 or event2). Since event1 happens, C1 is true.
3. C2 = (event1 or event2). Same as C1, so C2 is true.
4. C3 = not C2. Since C2 is true, C3 is false.
5. C4 = (C3 or event2). C3 is false, but event2 does happen (by the rules), so C4 is true.
6. C5 = C4 always holds. Given C4 is true (as a fact about the timeline), C5 is true.
7. C6 = (C1 or C5). Both C1 and C5 are true, so C6 is true.
8. C7 = not C6. Since C6 is true, C7 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked
C6 is the conjunction of C4 and C5. We must decide whether C6 can be true given the context.

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially, event2 happened (so at the initial state event2 is true).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has occurred, there are no further event occurrences in the future).
- After event1, event2 must happen (irrelevant here because event1 never occurs before the initial event2).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: “Event1 happens and event1 happens” — this just says event1 happens. Given event2 already happened initially and no events can happen afterwards, event1 does not happen. So C1 is false.
- C2: “C1 always holds” — since C1 is false at the initial state, C2 is false.
- C3: “C2 does not hold” — C2 is false, so C3 is true.
- C4: “C3 holds in the next state” — because event2 occurred initially and no further events can happen, there is no meaningful next state with events; under standard temporal semantics Next(...) is false when there is no next state, so C4 is false. (Even if one allowed a stuttering next state, C5 below still fails.)
- C5: “C1 always holds” — same as C2, false.
- C6: “C4 holds and C5 holds” — requires both C4 and C5 true; C5 is false (and C4 is also false), so C6 is false.

Final answer
False
---
Reasoning (concise, non-reflective):

- Initially event2 has happened and after event2 no other events can happen, so event1 never happens.
- C1 (""event1 happens and event1 happens"") is therefore false.
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.
- C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true.
- C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is true (C2 remains false in the next state).
- C5 (""C1 always holds"") is false (same as C2).
- C6 (""C4 holds and C5 holds"") requires C5, which is false, so C6 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
We must determine whether C6 (""C4 holds and C5 holds"") is true given the context and the definitions of the Ci.

Step 2 — restate the context
- Initially, event2 has happened (so the initial state already has event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so there is no next state after the initial state).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so if event1 ever occurs, event2 must occur afterwards).

Step 3 — interpret each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — this just asserts that event1 happens (redundantly).
  Given the context, event1 does not happen (initial state already has event2 and no events can occur after that), so C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — since C1 is false in the current (initial) state, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — C2 is false, so C3 is true (its negation is true).
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — there is no next state (after event2 no events can happen), so ""next state"" does not exist; therefore C4 is false.
- C5: ""C1 always holds"" — same as C2, so false.
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds"" — requires both C4 and C5 true; both are false, so C6 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step, evaluated from the initial state where event2 occurs at time 0):

- Timeline given the constraints: time0: event2, time1: event1, time2: event2, time3: event1, … (events alternate forever).

- C1 (event1 or event2): true at time0 (event2 occurs).

- C2 (C1 eventually holds): true at time0 because C1 already holds at time0.

- C3 (C2 holds in the next state): check time1 — at time1 C1 holds (event1), so C2 holds at time1; therefore C3 is true at time0.

- C4 (C3 eventually holds): true at time0 because C3 holds at time0.

- C5 (C4 does not hold): false at time0 because C4 is true.

- C6 (C5 holds or event2 happens): true at time0 because event2 happens at time0 (even though C5 is false).

- C7 (C6 holds in the next state): requires C6 to be true at time1. At time1:
  - event2 does not happen (event1 occurs),
  - C4 is true at time1 (by the same alternation reasoning), so C5 is false at time1.
  - Thus C6 is false at time1.
So C7 is false at time0.

Hence C7 is False.
---
You're asking whether C7 (which says ""C6 holds in the next state"") is true in the initial state, given the system that starts with event2 and thereafter alternates: after event2 comes event1, after event1 comes event2, etc.

Interpretation (standard linear temporal operators):
- ""eventually"" = F (holds now or at some future state),
- ""in the next state"" = X.

Label states s0 (initial), s1 (next), s2, ...; events alternate: s0: event2, s1: event1, s2: event2, s3: event1, ...

Evaluate the conditions at s0:

1. C1 = (event1 ∨ event2). At s0 event2 is true, so C1 is true.
2. C2 = F C1. Since C1 is already true at s0, C2 is true at s0.
3. C3 = X C2. C2 holds at s1 as well (see below), so C3 is true at s0.
   - (More explicitly: at s1 event1 holds, so C1 true at s1, hence C2 true at s1, so X C2 is true at s0.)
4. C4 = F C3. C3 is true at s0 (and in fact at every state), so C4 is true at s0.
5. C5 = not C4. Therefore C5 is false at s0.
6. C6 = (C5 ∨ event2). At s0 event2 is true, so C6 is true at s0.
7. C7 = X C6. This requires C6 to hold at s1. At s1, C5 is false (because C4 is true there too) and event2 is false (s1 has event1), so C6 is false at s1. Thus X C6 is false at s0.

Therefore C7 is False.
---
Reasoning:

- From the context we get an alternating sequence starting initially with event2: s0: event2, s1: event1, s2: event2, s3: event1, ...
- C1 = (event1 or event2). That is true at every state.
- C2 = eventually C1. Since C1 holds now at every state, C2 is true at every state.
- C3 = (C2 holds in the next state). C2 is true everywhere, so C3 is true at every state.
- C4 = eventually C3. C3 is true everywhere, so C4 is true at every state.
- C5 = not C4. Since C4 is true everywhere, C5 is false at every state.
- C6 = (C5 or event2). With C5 false, C6 is equivalent to event2 — true exactly at states where event2 occurs (s0, s2, ...).
- C7 = (C6 holds in the next state). So C7 is true at a state iff event2 occurs in the next state.

At the initial state s0, the next state s1 has event1 (not event2), so C6 is false at s1 and thus C7 is false at s0.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
First, what the hypothesis asks: is C7 true or false?

Interpretation of the context:
- Initially event2 has happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so the sequence is event2 then event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Examine the conditions:
- C1 = ""event2 happens or event2 happens"" — trivial repetition, so C1 is true because event2 did happen initially.
- C2 = same as C1, so C2 is true (at the initial moment).
- C3 = ""C2 always holds"". That would require C2 to be true at all times. But C2 reports that event2 happens (which only occurred initially); it does not remain true at all later times once the system proceeds to event1 and then stops. So C3 is false.
- C4 = ""C3 always holds"" — false because C3 is false.
- C5 = ""C1 holds and C4 holds"" — false because C4 is false.
- C6 = ""C5 always holds"" — false because C5 is false.
- C7 = ""C6 eventually holds"" — since C6 never holds at any time, C7 is false.

Therefore, C7 is False.
---

---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C7 states: ""C6 eventually holds."" We must decide if that is true given the context and the chain of conditions.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event2 occurs (so event2 is true at the initial moment).
- After event2, event1 must occur (so event1 will occur at some later moment).
- After event1, no other events can happen (so after event1 there are no further event occurrences).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1 and C2 are the same: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" which is equivalent to ""Event2 happens"" (true at the initial moment when event2 occurs).
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — this asserts that event2 holds at every time point. But event2 happens only initially; it does not hold at later times (events are instantaneous and do not remain true forever). Thus C3 is false at times after the initial moment.
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — since C3 is not true at all times, C4 is false.
- C5: ""C1 holds and C4 holds"" — C1 holds initially but C4 is false, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 always holds"" — since C5 is false at least at some times, C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds"" — since C6 never holds, C7 is false.

Sample responses:
What is asked: determine whether C7 is true or false given the context and the conditions.

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context: event2 happens initially. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, no further events occur. Thus both event2 and event1 do occur (event2 at the start, then event1).

2. Evaluate C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Since event2 does happen (initially), the implication C1 is true.

3. Evaluate C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" C1 holds (from step 2), and event1 does happen (from context), so C2 is true.

4. Evaluate C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" C2 holds and event2 happens, so C3 is true.

5. Evaluate C4: ""C3 does not hold."" But C3 holds, so C4 is false.

6. Evaluate C5: ""C4 always holds."" C4 is false, so C5 does not hold (is false).

7. Evaluate C6: ""C5 does not hold."" Since C5 is false, C6 is true.

8. Evaluate C7: ""C6 always holds."" C6 is true (and nothing in the setup makes it time-varying), so C7 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — understand the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur sometime after the initial event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Therefore the actual event sequence is: event2 happens first, then event1 happens, then nothing else.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition in that sequence
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" Event1 does happen, and event2 did happen earlier, so the implication is true. Thus C1 holds.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" C1 does hold, and event1 does happen, so C2 holds.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" Both parts are true (C2 holds; event2 happened), so C3 holds.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" But C3 does hold, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" C4 is false, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" Since C5 is false, C6 is true.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" C6 is true (and nothing in the sequence makes C5 become true later), so C6 is always true — therefore C7 holds.

Final answer:
True
---
Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context:
   - Initially event2 happened.
   - After event2, event1 must happen. So event1 will occur (after the initial event2).
   - After event1 no other events can happen. (That just makes event1 terminal; it doesn't prevent event1 from occurring.)

2. Evaluate the Ci in order, treating them as static statements about the described run:
   - C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" In the actual run event2 already happened initially, and event1 does happen later, so C1 is true.
   - C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" C1 holds, so this implies event1 happens; that matches the context requirement that event1 must happen after event2. So C2 is true.
   - C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" Both are true (C2 true, event2 happened initially), so C3 is true.
   - C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This is false because C3 does hold.
   - C5: ""C4 always holds."" Since C4 is false, C5 is false.
   - C6: ""C5 does not hold."" This is true because C5 is false.
   - C7: ""C6 always holds."" C6 is true, and nothing in the scenario makes these status facts change over time, so C6 holds (and continues to hold). Thus C7 is true.

3. There is no contradiction in the above assignments given the context (the event ordering is consistent and the Ci are statements about those events/truths), so C7 is True."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked
- C7 is ""C6 eventually holds."" We must decide whether that is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context as a timeline (standard temporal reading)
- Initially (time 0): event1 happened (event1 is true at time 0).
- After event1, event2 must happen at some later time t>0.
- After event2 happens it is terminal: no further events occur after t.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions over time
- C1 = (event2 ∨ event1). This is true at times when either event occurs: true at time 0 (event1) and at time t (event2), false at intermediate times when neither event occurs.
- C2 is the same as C1, so same truth values.
- C3 = C1 ∧ C2, so true exactly when C1 is true (time 0 and time t).
- C4 = “C3 always holds” (a global/always claim). C3 is not true at intermediate times, so C4 is false.
- C5 = (C4 ∨ event1). Since C4 is false, C5 reduces to event1, so C5 holds only at time 0.
- C6 = “C5 does not hold.” Thus C6 is false at time 0 and true at all later times (after time 0).
- C7 = “C6 eventually holds.” Since C6 becomes true immediately after time 0, C7 is true.

Final answer:
True

---
Step 1 — what’s asked
- We must decide whether C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → event2 does happen (at some later time).
- After event2, no other events can happen.
Thus both event1 and event2 occur (event1 already occurred; event2 will occur), and no further events occur after event2.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" Since both events occur, C1 is true.

Question: Is C7 true?

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Context forces alternation starting with event1 (initially event1 happened), so event2 must occur next. Therefore the proposition ""Event2 does not happen"" (C1) is false.
2. C2 is the same as C1, so C2 is false.
3. C3 asserts (C2 holds) and (event2 happens). That is a conjunction of ""event2 does not happen"" and ""event2 happens"", which is contradictory, so C3 is false.
4. C4 says ""C3 always holds"". Since C3 is already false, C4 is false.
5. C5 is C1 and C4; both are false, so C5 is false.
6. C6 is ""C5 holds in the next state""; since C5 is false now, C6 is false.
7. C7 is ""C6 always holds""; because C6 is false, C7 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what’s asked:
- Decide whether C7 is True or False.

Step 2 — understand the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
So the system forces alternating occurrences event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 … In particular, event2 does occur (immediately after the initial event1).

Step 3 — examine the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Given the context, this is false.
- C2: same as C1, so false.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" This is (false) AND (true) → false (contradiction).
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Since C3 is false, C4 is false.
- C5: ""C1 holds and C4 holds."" Both conjuncts false, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" C5 is false, so C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" C6 is false, so C7 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
You are asked whether C7 is True or False given the context and the chain of conditions C1…C7.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so in the next state after the initial one, event2 occurs).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so they alternate: event1, event2, event1, …).

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: event2 does not happen (¬event2).
- C2: event2 does not happen (same as C1).
- C3: C2 holds and event2 happens → (¬event2) ∧ event2. This is a direct contradiction, so C3 is false in any state.
- C4: C3 always holds → since C3 is impossible, C4 is false.
- C5: C1 holds and C4 holds → false (because C4 is false).
- C6: C5 holds in the next state → false.
- C7: C6 always holds → false (since C6 is false).

Also, independently the context already forces event2 to occur after the initial event1, so C1/C2 are already false in the scenario.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Timeline from the context: s0 (initial): event1 true. By “after event1, event2 must happen” take s1: event2 true. By “after event2, no other events can happen” there are no further events in s2, s3, ...

- C1: “If event2 happens, then event1 happens.” At s1 event2 happens but event1 does not, so C1 is false in s1.

- C2: “C1 holds in the next state” — this asserts C1 at s1, so C2 is false.

- C3: “C2 always holds” — false because C2 is false.

- C4: “C3 eventually holds” — false (C3 never holds).

- C5: “C4 eventually holds” — false.

- C6: “C5 does not hold” — true, since C5 is false.

- C7: “C6 does not hold” — false, because C6 is true.

Thus C7 is False.

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context, event2 occurs first and then (at a later state) event1 occurs; they do not occur simultaneously in the same state.

2. C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" — interpreted as both happening at the same state — is false in every state (they occur at different times).

3. C2: ""C1 always holds"" (globally) is false because C1 is false in every state.

4. C3: ""C2 does not hold"" is therefore true (since C2 is false).

5. C4: ""C3 does not hold"" is false (because C3 is true).

6. C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" is false, because C4 is false in every state (including the next).

7. C6: same as C1, so false.

8. C7: ""C5 holds and C6 holds"" is false ∧ false, hence false.

Sample responses:
We need to decide whether C6 (""C5 always holds"") is True or False.

1) From the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
Thus the events alternate indefinitely: event2, event1, event2, event1, ... In particular, event1 does happen (indeed, infinitely often).

2) Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — redundant but true (event1 does happen).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens"" — still true (event1 happens).
- C3: same as C2 — true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" — false, since C3 holds.
- C5: ""If C2 holds, then C4 holds"" — this is (true -> false), so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 always holds"" — requires C5 to be true, but C5 is false, so C6 is false.

Final answer: False
---
The hypothesis asks whether C6 (""C5 always holds"") is True or False.

Step-by-step reasoning:

- From the context: event2 happened initially, and the rules force event1 after event2 and event2 after event1, so event1 does occur (in fact repeatedly, alternating with event2).
- C1 = ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — redundant, but true because event1 happens.
- C2 = ""C1 holds and event1 happens"" and C3 = ""C1 holds and event1 happens"" — they are identical to each other and reduce to ""event1 happens"" (so C2 and C3 are true).
- C4 = ""C3 does not hold"" — since C3 is true, C4 is false.
- C5 = ""If C2 holds, then C4 holds"" = ""If C2 then not C3"". Because C2 and C3 are the same, this is equivalent to ""If C2 then not C2"", i.e. equivalent to not C2. But C2 is true, so C5 is false.
- C6 = ""C5 always holds"" would require C5 to be true; since C5 is false, C6 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
C6 is the claim ""C5 always holds."" We need to decide whether that claim is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — simplify the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" → simply: Event1 happens.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens"" → Event1 holds (redundant).
- C3: same as C2 → Event1 holds.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" → not(Event1).
- C5: ""If C2 holds, then C4 holds"" → If Event1 then not(Event1). (an implication that is false when Event1 is true)
- C6: ""C5 always holds.""

Step 3 — use the context
Context: initially event2 happened; after event2, event1 must happen; after event1, event2 must happen. So event1 does happen (following event2), and the events alternate; in particular Event1 is true at least at the required point.

Step 4 — evaluate C5 and C6
Because Event1 holds, C2 is true and C4 (not Event1) is false. Thus ""If C2 then C4"" is false. So C5 is false. Therefore C6 (""C5 always holds"") is false.

Final answer:
False"

Reasoning step by step:

- From the context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. So event1 never happens.  
- Therefore C1, C2, and C5 (""Event1 does not happen"") are true.  
- C3 (""C2 eventually holds""): since C2 already holds immediately, C3 is true.  
- C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is therefore false.  
- C6 (""C4 holds and C5 holds"") is false because C4 is false (conjunction with true C5 is false).  
- C7 is the implication ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds."" Here C1 is true but C6 is false, so the implication is false.

Hence C7 is False.
---
Step 1 — interpret context:
- Initially event2 has occurred.
- After event2, no other events can occur.
- If event1 occurs, event2 must occur after it.

From ""initially event2 happened"" and ""no events can happen after event2"", event1 cannot occur at any time (there is no time before the initial state), so:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" — True.
- C2: same as C1 — True.

Step 2 — derive C3–C6:
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 already holds, C3 is True.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is True, C4 is False.
- C5: ""Event1 does not happen."" — True (same as C1/C2).
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" C4 is False and C5 is True, so C6 is False.

Step 3 — evaluate C7:
- C7 is ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds."" Antecedent C1 is True but consequent C6 is False, so the implication is False.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — interpret context:
- Initially event2 has happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So no events occur after the initial event2.
- The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant because event1 cannot occur (it would have to occur before the initial event2, but the initial state already has event2).

Step 2 — evaluate conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" True (event1 cannot occur).
- C2: same as C1, so True.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 already holds now (and at all times), the eventuality holds — True.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" False (C3 is True).
- C5: ""Event1 does not happen."" True.
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" False (C4 is False, C5 is True).
- C7: ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds."" C1 is True but C6 is False, so the implication is False.

Let's reason step by step.

1. What is asked: Determine whether C6 (""C5 always holds"") is True or False given the context and the other conditions.

2. Context facts:
   - Initially, event2 happened.
   - After event2, no other events can happen.
   - After event1, no other events can happen.

   From ""Initially, event2 happened"" and ""after event2 no other events can happen"", we conclude event1 does not happen in the next state. So C1 (""Event1 happens in the next state"") is False.

3. Evaluate the conditions:
   - C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" This implication is true (it is vacuously true when C1 is False, or true trivially if C1 were true).
   - C3: same as C2, so also True.
   - C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds"" → True and True = True.
   - C5: ""C4 does not hold"" → negation of True = False.
   - C6: ""C5 always holds"" — since C5 is already False in the actual state, C5 does not always hold, so C6 is False.

Final answer:
False

Answer: False

Reasoning (step by step):

1. The question: Is C6 (""C5 always holds"") true given the context?

2. From the context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. Therefore in the next state event1 does not happen.

3. Evaluate conditions:
- C1 (""event1 happens in the next state"") is false.
- C2 (""if C1 holds, then event1 happens"") is an implication with a false antecedent, so C2 is true (vacuously).
- C3 is the same as C2, so C3 is also true.
- C4 = C2 and C3 is true.
- C5 = ""C4 does not hold"" is therefore false.

4. C6 asserts that C5 always holds. But C5 is already false (in the initial/next state), so C6 is false.

We evaluate all Ci at the initial state (state0). From the context, the required behavior is an alternation starting with event2 at state0, then event1 at some later state (we take it at state1), then event2 at state2, etc. So use this timeline:
- state0: event2 = True, event1 = False
- state1: event1 = True, event2 = False
- state2: event2 = True, ...

Now evaluate the conditions at state0:

- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Interpreted as the state0 implication event2 -> event1. At state0 event2 = True and event1 = False, so C1 = False.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" At state0, C1 = False but event2 = True, so C2 = True.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 already holds at state0, so ""eventually"" is satisfied: C3 = True.
- C4: ""C3 holds and event2 happens."" At state0, C3 = True and event2 = True, so C4 = True.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (brief):
- From the context the events alternate: event1 at time 0, event2 at time 1, event1 at time 2, etc. So event1 does not hold at every state → C1 is false.
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") is therefore false, so C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true.
- That truth persists in subsequent states, so C4 and C5 are true.
- Since C5 already holds, C6 (""C5 eventually holds"") is true.
- C7 asserts ""C6 does not hold"", but C6 does hold, so C7 is false.
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
- C7 is the statement ""C6 does not hold"" (i.e. ¬C6). We must determine whether C7 is true or false given the event rules and the listed conditions.

Step 2 — interpret the context and temporal operators
- The context gives an infinite alternating sequence starting at the initial state s0: s0: event1, s1: event2, s2: event1, s3: event2, ...
- Read the conditions as usual temporal claims:
  - ""always"" means globally (G),
  - ""in the next state"" means X,
  - ""eventually"" means F.

Step 3 — evaluate conditions along the sequence (from the initial state)
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" = G(event1). This is false, because event1 does not hold at s1, s3, ...
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" = G(C1). Since C1 is already false at s0, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" = ¬C2. So C3 is true at s0 (and in fact at every state, because C2 is false on every suffix).
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" = X C3. C3 is true at s1 (same reasoning), so C4 is true at s0.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" = X C4. C4 is true at s1 (because C3 is true at s2), so C5 is true at s0.
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds"" = F C5. C5 already holds at s0, so F C5 is true at s0. Hence C6 is true.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold"" = ¬C6. Since C6 is true, C7 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Time 0: event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen; after event2, event1 must happen. So the system alternates forever: event1 at times 0,2,4,... and event2 at times 1,3,5,...

Step 2 — interpret the Ci statements (natural LTL reading):
- Let p = ""event1 happens"" at the current state.
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" = G p (p holds at every state).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" = G (G p) (equivalently G p).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" = ¬ G (G p) (equivalently ¬ G p).
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" = X ¬ G p.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" = X X ¬ G p.
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds"" = F (X X ¬ G p).
- C7: ""C6 does not hold"" = ¬ F (X X ¬ G p).

Step 3 — evaluate on the alternating trace p = true, false, true, false, ...
- C1 (G p) is false because p is false at odd times.
- Hence ¬ G p holds at every state (because from any state there is some future state where p is false — indeed the very next state when the current is an event1 state).
- Therefore C3 (¬ G p) is true everywhere.
- That makes X ¬ G p and X X ¬ G p true as well (they hold because ¬ G p holds at every future state).
- So F (X X ¬ G p) is true (it holds immediately).
- Therefore C6 is true, and C7 = ¬ C6 is false.

Sample responses:
Reasoning:

- From the context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. So no events can occur in any future state.

- C1 (""Event1 happens in the next state""): This is false, because no events (including event1) can happen after the initial state.

- C2 (""C1 does not hold""): True (since C1 is false).

- C3 (""If C2 holds, then event1 happens""): The antecedent C2 is true, so C3 would require event1 to happen; but event1 cannot happen. Thus C3 is false.

- C4 (""C3 does not hold""): True (since C3 is false).

- C5 (""C4 holds in the next state""): Evaluate C4 at the next state. The same reasoning applies there (no events can happen in any future state), so C3 is still false in the next state and C4 is true in the next state. Therefore C5 is true.

- C6 (""C5 does not hold""): False (since C5 is true).

- C7 (""C6 always holds""): This requires C6 to be true in all states, but C6 is already false in the initial state. Therefore C7 is false.

Final answer: False
---
First identify the question: C7 asserts ""C6 always holds"" (i.e., at every state C6 is true). We must decide whether that is true given the context and the chain of Ci definitions.

Context summary:
- At the initial state s0, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. Therefore event1 never happens at any later state (nor at s0, because event2 happened there).

Evaluate the Ci at s0 (and the next states):

1. C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Since no events can occur after event2, event1 does not happen in the next state. So C1 is false at s0.
2. C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Thus C2 is true at s0.
3. C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" At s0, C2 is true but event1 does not happen, so the implication is false. Hence C3 is false at s0.
4. C4: ""C3 does not hold."" So C4 is true at s0.
5. C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" At s1 (the next state) the same reasoning applies: event1 never happens, so C1 false, C2 true, C3 false, C4 true. Thus C4 does hold in the next state, so C5 is true at s0.
6. C6: ""C5 does not hold."" Since C5 is true at s0, C6 is false at s0.
7. C7: ""C6 always holds."" C6 is false at s0 (in fact false at every state by the same reasoning), so C7 is false.

Step 1 — what’s asked
You are asked whether C7 (""C6 holds in the next state"") is true or false given the described event sequence.

Step 2 — model the sequence of states
Initial state s0: event1 happens.
Because after event1 event2 must happen, s1: event2 happens.
Because after event2 event1 must happen, s2: event1 happens.
So states alternate: s0 (event1), s1 (event2), s2 (event1), s3 (event2), ...

Step 3 — evaluate the Ci formulas at each kind of state

Evaluate at an event1 state (s0, s2, ...):
- C1: ""If event2 then event1."" Antecedent false (event2 does not happen), so C1 is true (vacuously).
- C2: same as C1 → true.
- C3: ""Event2 and C2"" → false (event2 false).
- C4: ""C3 or event1"" → true (event1 true).
- C5: ""If C1 then C4"" → true (C1 true and C4 true).
- C6: ""C5 does not hold"" → false (since C5 holds).
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state"" → look at next state (which is an event2 state); as shown below C6 is false there, so C7 is false at event1 states.

Evaluate at an event2 state (s1, s3, ...):
- C1: antecedent true (event2), consequent false (event1), so C1 is false.
- C2: false.
- C3: ""Event2 and C2"" → false (C2 false).
- C4: ""C3 or event1"" → false (both false).
- C5: ""If C1 then C4"" → true (antecedent false → implication true).
- C6: ""C5 does not hold"" → false (C5 holds).
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state"" → next state is an event1 state where C6 is also false, so C7 is false here too.

Step 4 — conclusion
C6 is false in every state, so ""C6 holds in the next state"" (C7) is false in every state.

Final answer: False
---
We treat ""Initially"" as state 0 and ""next state"" as state 1. From the context:
- state0: event1 is true.
- after event1, event2 must happen → state1: event2 is true.
- after event2, event1 must happen → state2: event1 is true (so in state1 event1 is false).

Evaluate the Ci in state0 (the initial state) and state1 (the “next” state), since C7 says ""C6 holds in the next state"" (i.e., state1).

State0:
- event1 = true, event2 = false.
- C1 (event2 → event1): antecedent false ⇒ C1 = true.
- C2 (same as C1) ⇒ C2 = true.
- C3 (event2 ∧ C2): false ∧ true ⇒ C3 = false.
- C4 (C3 ∨ event1): false ∨ true ⇒ C4 = true.
- C5 (C1 → C4): true → true ⇒ C5 = true.
- C6 (¬C5): false.

State1:
- event2 = true, event1 = false.
- C1 (event2 → event1): true → false ⇒ C1 = false.
- C2 = false (same).
- C3 (event2 ∧ C2): true ∧ false ⇒ C3 = false.
- C4 (C3 ∨ event1): false ∨ false ⇒ C4 = false.
- C5 (C1 → C4): false → false ⇒ C5 = true (implication with false antecedent is true).
- C6 (¬C5): false.

C7 asserts ""C6 holds in the next state"" — i.e., that C6 is true in state1. We found C6 is false in state1. Therefore C7 is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Timeline from the context:
   - At t0 (initial): event1 happened.
   - After event1, event2 must happen, so at t1 event2 happens.
   - After event2 no other events can happen, so at t2 and later there are no events.

2. Evaluate the conditions at t0:
   - C1: ""event2 happens in the next state"" — true (event2 happens at t1).
   - C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens"" — true (C1 is true).
   - C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — false (C2 holds).
   - C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — check C3 at t1. At t1, event2 is happening, and C1 at t1 (meaning event2 at t2) is false, but C2 at t1 is still true because event2 is happening at t1. Thus C3 is false at t1, so C4 is false at t0.
   - C5: ""event2 happens in the next state"" — same as C1, true at t0.
   - C6: ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds"" — an implication with a false antecedent (C4 is false), so C6 is true.
   - C7: ""C6 does not hold"" — false (C6 does hold).

Therefore C7 is False.

Answer: False

Step-by-step reasoning

1. From the context: initially event1 happened, and “after event1, event2 must happen.” So in the next state event2 does happen. Therefore C1 (""Event2 happens in the next state"") is True.

2. C2 is ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" Since C1 is True, C2 is True.

3. C3 is ""C2 does not hold."" Because C2 is True, C3 is False.

4. C4 is ""C3 holds in the next state."" C3 is already False and nothing forces it to become true, so C4 is False.

5. C5 is ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Whether or not this is true in some later reference, it is irrelevant for the next step: C6 is ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds."" An implication with a false antecedent (C4 is False) is vacuously True, so C6 is True.

6. C7 is ""C6 does not hold."" Since C6 holds, C7 is False.

Thus C7 is False.
---
The hypothesis asks whether C7 (""C6 does not hold"") is true or false.

Step-by-step:

1. From the context: initially event1 happened (call that state s0). After event1, event2 must happen, so in the next state s1 event2 occurs. After event2 no other events can happen (so s1 has event2 and later states have no new events).

2. Evaluate the conditions at the initial point (s0):
   - C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" True (event2 occurs in s1).
   - C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" True (C1 is true).
   - C3: ""C2 does not hold."" False (C2 is true).
   - C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" That asks whether C3 is true in s1. In s1, C2 is true (because event2 occurs there), so C3 is false in s1; therefore C4 is false.
   - C5: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" From s0 this is C1 again (true), but C5 is only relevant as the consequent below.
   - C6: ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds."" Since C4 is false, the implication is vacuously true, so C6 holds.
   - C7: ""C6 does not hold."" This is false because we just established C6 holds.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the context we get an infinite alternating sequence of events starting with event2: state0: event2, state1: event1, state2: event2, state3: event1, ...
- C1 (""event2 does not happen"") is true exactly in the states where event1 happens (state1, state3, ...), so C1 holds infinitely often.
- C2 (eventually C1) is true in every state (there is always a future state with event1).
- C3 (always C2, i.e. G F C1) is true: from every state, eventually a state with C1 occurs (in fact every other state).
- C4 (C3 holds in the next state, X C3) is true because C3 holds in every state.
- C5 (not C4) is therefore false, and C6 (always C5) is false.
- C7 (eventually C6) asks whether at some future point C6 becomes true forever; since C6 is false in every state (X C3 is true everywhere), there is no future point from which C6 holds always.

You're asking whether C7 is true given the context.

Step 1 — understand the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (Thus once event1 has occurred, no further events — including event2 — can occur.)
- The clause ""After event2, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant because event2 cannot occur after event1.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" is equivalent to ""event2 happens."" Given the context, event2 does not (and cannot) happen. So C1 is False.
- C2: same as C1, so False.
- C3: ""Event2 happens and C2 holds"" — requires event2 to happen; since event2 does not happen, C3 is False.
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — C3 is not true, so C4 is False.
- C5: ""C1 holds and C4 holds"" — both are False, so C5 is False.
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds"" — C5 is never true, so C6 is False.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds"" — since C6 is false and never becomes true, C7 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — understand the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Since event1 happened initially, that means no other events (including event2) can ever happen.
- The other statement ""After event2, no other events can happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never occurs.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition given that event2 never happens:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — equivalent to ""Event2 happens"" → False.
- C2: same as C1 → False.
- C3: ""Event2 happens and C2 holds"" — requires event2 to happen → False.
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — C3 is already false, so ""always C3"" is False.
- C5: ""C1 holds and C4 holds"" — both are false → False.
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds"" — C5 never becomes true (no events occur) → False.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds"" — C6 never becomes true → False.

False

- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has happened — which it has initially — no further events can occur.)
- Therefore event2 can never happen at any time.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — equivalent to ""Event2 happens"". This is false because event2 never happens.
- C2: same as C1, so false.
- C3: ""Event2 happens and C2 holds"" — requires event2; false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — since C3 is false, C4 is false.
- C5: ""C1 holds and C4 holds"" — both conjuncts are false, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds"" — since C5 is never true, C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds"" — since C6 is never true, C7 is false.

Answer: True

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Setup a timeline of states s0, s1, s2, ... with s0 the initial state.
   - By context, event2 happens at s0.
   - ""After event2, no other events can happen"" means no events (neither event1 nor event2) occur at s1, s2, ...
   - Hence event1 never happens anywhere.

2. Evaluate the conditions:
   - C1: ""Event2 always happens."" This is false (event2 occurs at s0 but not at s1, s2, ...).
   - C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" Since C1 is false and event1 never happens, C2 is false at every state.
   - C3: ""C2 holds or event2 happens."" C3 is true at s0 (because event2 holds there) and false at every later state (no event2 and C2 false).
   - C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — at a state t, C4 means C3 holds at t+1. In particular, at s1, C4 requires C3 at s2, which is false.
   - C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" At s1 this means there exists some future state u ≥ s1 with C4 true; equivalently there exists u ≥ s2 with C3 true. But for all u ≥ s2, C3 is false (no event2 and C2 false), so C5 is false at s1.
   - C6: ""C5 does not hold."" Therefore C6 is true at s1.
   - C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" At s0, C7 asks whether C6 holds at s1 — which we found true.

Therefore C7 is True."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
C7 is False.

Reasoning:
- From the context (initially event2, and after event2 event1 must happen, and after event1 event2 must happen) we conclude event1 eventually happens.
- Therefore C1, C2, and C4 (all ""Event1 eventually happens"") are true.
- C3 (""If C1 holds then C2 holds"") is true (both C1 and C2 are true).
- C5 (""Event1 happens or C4 holds"") is true because C4 is true.
- C6 (""If C3 holds then C5 holds"") is true (antecedent and consequent are both true).
- C7 (""C6 does not hold"") is therefore false.
---
You are asking whether C7 (""C6 does not hold"") is true or false.

Step-by-step:

- From the context: initially event2 occurred, and after event2 event1 must happen. Therefore event1 eventually happens. So C1 is true. (C2 and C4 are identical statements, so they are also true.)

- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Since C1 and C2 are the same and true, C3 is true (and in general A → A is always true).

- C5: ""Event1 happens or C4 holds."" C4 is true, so C5 is true regardless.

- C6: ""If C3 holds, then C5 holds."" C3 is true and C5 is true, so C6 is true.

- C7 states that C6 does not hold. But we have established C6 does hold, so C7 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — interpret context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → event1 will occur next.
- After event1, event2 must happen → they alternate, so event1 does eventually occur.

Step 2 — evaluate conditions:
- C1: Event1 eventually happens. True.
- C2: Event1 eventually happens. True.
- C3: If C1 holds, then C2 holds. Since C1 and C2 are both true, C3 is True.
- C4: Event1 eventually happens. True.
- C5: Event1 happens or C4 holds. C4 is true, so C5 is True.
- C6: If C3 holds, then C5 holds. C3 and C5 are true, so C6 is True.
- C7: C6 does not hold. Since C6 holds, C7 is False.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is asked
- The hypothesis claims C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" We must determine whether C7 is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (A → A) and is true in every state.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is a tautology, C2 is true.
- C3: Same as C1, so true.
- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds."" Both are true, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" This contradicts C4, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""Event1 happens and C5 holds."" Because C5 is false, C6 is false in any state (even in a state where event1 happens).
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" For C7 to be true there must be a next state where C6 is true.

Step 3 — use the context about events
- Timeline: initially event2 happened; then event1 must happen; after event1 no further events can happen (so the state with event1 is terminal).
- In the state where event1 happens, C6 is false (event1 true but C5 false). There is no subsequent state where C6 could become true (and in any case C6 is false in every state).

Conclusion
- C7 is False.

False
---
We are asked whether C7 can be true.

Step-by-step evaluation of the conditions:

- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology, so C1 is true in every state.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is a tautology, C2 is true.
- C3: same as C1, so true.
- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds."" Both are true, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" This is the negation of C4, so C5 is false (because C4 is true).
- C6: ""Event1 happens and C5 holds."" C5 is false, so C6 is false in every state (regardless of whether event1 happens).
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" Since C6 is false in all states, it cannot hold in the next state.

The context (event2 then event1, then no further events) does not change the truth values above: even if event1 does occur, C5 is false, so C6 cannot become true.

Final answer:
False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology, so C1 is true in any state.

2. C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is a tautology, C2 is true.

3. C3: same as C1, so C3 is true.

4. C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds."" Both are true, so C4 is true.

5. C5: ""C4 does not hold."" This contradicts step 4, so C5 is false.

6. C6: ""Event1 happens and C5 holds."" C5 is false, so C6 is false (regardless of whether event1 happens).

7. C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" The system timeline (after event2, event1 must happen; after event1 no other events) gives that event1 does occur in the next state, but C5 remains false there, so C6 does not hold in that next state. Therefore C7 is false.

Thus C7 is False."

False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Timeline from the context: state0: event2 happened. By the rules, state1: event1 happens. state2: event2 happens, etc. (they alternate forever).

- Evaluate the conditions at the initial state (state0):
  - C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" At state0, event1 does not happen → C1 is true at state0.
  - C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" At state0 C1 holds and event2 does happen (state0), so C2 is true at state0.
  - C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" Both parts true at state0 → C3 is true at state0.
  - C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" In state1, event2 does not happen (event1 does), so C3 is false in state1 → C4 is false at state0.
  - C5: ""C4 always holds."" C4 is already false at state0, so C5 is false.
  - C6: ""C5 does not hold."" Since C5 is false, C6 is true.
  - C7: ""C6 does not hold."" But C6 is true, so C7 is false.

Therefore C7 is False.
---
Goal: determine truth of C7 (""C6 does not hold"").

Context summary:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
Thus events alternate: state0: event2, state1: event1, state2: event2, etc.

Evaluate the conditions state by state (taking state0 as the initial state):

- C1: ""Event1 does not happen.""
  - At state0 event2 happened and, by the rules, event1 will happen at state1; but C1 is evaluated at state0 as written — event1 does not happen at state0, so if intended for state0, C1 is true only if event1 never happens. The intended reading here is global ""Event1 does not happen"" which contradicts the alternation (event1 does occur at state1). So C1 is false (event1 does happen later).

- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens.""
  - As a material implication, since C1 is false, C2 is vacuously true at state0.

- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens.""
  - C2 is true and event2 did happen at state0, so C3 is true at state0.

- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" (state1).
  - In state1, event1 happens (not event2). C2 in state1 is still vacuously true (because C1 is false there), but ""event2 happens"" is false in state1, so C3 is false in state1. Thus C4 is false.

- C5: ""C4 always holds.""
  - C4 is false (it does not hold in state1), so C5 is false.

- C6: ""C5 does not hold.""
  - Since C5 is false, C6 is true.

- C7: ""C6 does not hold.""
  - C6 is true, so C7 is false.

Sample responses:
What is asked
- Determine whether C6 (C2 holds or C5 holds) is true given the three background constraints.

Examine the background constraints
1. Initially, event1 happened.
2. After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has occurred, no future event — including event2 — can ever occur.)
3. After event2, event1 must happen. (Irrelevant if event2 never occurs.)

Examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given (1) and (2), event1 has already happened initially and that prevents any further events; therefore event2 cannot happen at any time. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Event1 does happen initially, but C1 is false, so C2 is false.
- C3: same as C2, so false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 never holds, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" Since C4 is false (already false at the initial point), C5 is false.
- C6: ""C2 holds or C5 holds."" Both C2 and C5 are false, so C6 is false.

Final answer
False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C6 (""C2 holds or C5 holds"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened (so event1 is true at the start).
- After event1, no other events can happen (once event1 has occurred, there are no further events).
- After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 ever occurs, event1 must occur afterwards).

Together these mean: event1 has already happened at the start and no further events (including event2) can occur at any later time. So event2 never happens.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" false (event2 never happens).
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" event1 happens is true, but C1 is false, so C2 is false.
- C3: same as C2, so false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 never holds, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" since C4 is false, C5 is false.
- C6: ""C2 holds or C5 holds."" both are false, so C6 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
The question: is C6 true?

Step 1 — meaning of the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen → once event1 has happened, event2 can never occur afterwards.
- After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant because event2 cannot occur given the previous fact).

Step 2 — evaluate conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Impossible because event1 already happened initially and no further events can occur. So C1 is False.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Event1 does happen, but C1 is False → C2 is False.
- C3: same as C2 → False.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 will never hold (it is false now and cannot become true) → C4 is False.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" C4 is False, so C5 is False.
- C6: ""C2 holds or C5 holds."" Both C2 and C5 are False → C6 is False.

Step 1 — model the scenario
- s0 (initial): event1 holds.
- After event1 must come event2, and after event2 must come event1. So states alternate:
  s0: event1
  s1: event2
  s2: event1
  s3: event2
  ... and so on (s_n has event1 iff n is even).

Step 2 — interpret the Cs at a generic state s_k
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" — true at s_k iff s_{k+1} has event1, i.e. iff k+1 is even ⇔ k is odd. So C1 holds at odd states.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — true at s_k iff C1 holds at s_{k+1}, i.e. iff s_{k+2} has event1 ⇔ k+2 even ⇔ k even. So C2 holds at even states.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" (globally) — would require C2 to hold at every future state. But C2 holds only at even states and fails at odd states, so C3 is false (at s0 and at every state).
- C4: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — same formula as C1; it holds at odd states.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds"" — an implication. Since C3 is false, the implication is true (false ⇒ anything is true).
- C6: ""C5 does not hold"" — the negation of C5. But C5 holds, so C6 is false.

False

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C6 (C4 holds and C5 holds) is true given the context.

Context summary:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true now.
- After event1, no other events can happen. That means once event1 has occurred (and it has, initially), no further events (including event2) can occur.
- Also, after event2 no other events can happen (irrelevant here because event2 never occurs).

Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" This is false: because event1 happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, event2 cannot occur.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" C1 is false, event1 happens is true, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false, C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 already holds now, so ""eventually"" is satisfied; C4 is true.
- C5: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" Same as C2, this is false (C1 is false).
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" C4 is true but C5 is false, so C6 is false.

False

You ask whether C6 is True or False.

Step-by-step:

- From the context: initially event1 happened. Also ""after event1, no other events can happen."" Therefore no events (including event2) can occur after that initial time. So event2 never happens.
- C1 (""Event2 always happens""): False (event2 cannot happen).
- C2 (""C1 holds and event1 happens""): False (C1 is false, even though event1 did happen).
- C3 (""C2 does not hold""): True (C2 is false).
- C4 (""C3 eventually holds""): True (C3 already holds, so it eventually holds).
- C5 (""C1 holds and event1 happens""): False (same as C2).
- C6 (""C4 holds and C5 holds""): False (C4 true but C5 false, so the conjunction is false).

Final answer: False

We have:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 would also be terminal).

From ""initially event1 happened"" and ""after event1 no other events can happen"" it follows that no other event (in particular event2) can ever happen. So:

- C1 (event2 always happens) is false.
- C2 (C1 and event1) is false (C1 false, though event1 is true).
- C3 (C2 does not hold) is true.
- C4 (C3 eventually holds) is true (C3 already holds).
- C5 (C1 and event1) is false (same as C2).
- C6 (C4 and C5) requires both true, but C5 is false → C6 is false.

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Context: event2 has already happened initially. The rules “after event1, event2 must happen” and “after event2, event1 must happen” make event1 and event2 alternate indefinitely. So event2 does happen (initially and repeatedly).

2. Evaluate C1–C3:
   - C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This matches the given rule, so C1 is true.
   - C2 is the same as C1, so C2 is true.
   - C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Since C1 and C2 are both true, the implication C3 is true.

3. C4: ""C3 always holds."" Given C1 and C2 are invariant rules, C3 is always true, so C4 is true.

4. C5: ""C4 does not hold."" This contradicts C4, so C5 is false.

5. C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" Since C5 is false and never becomes true under the given invariant rules, C6 is false.

6. C7: ""Event2 happens and C6 holds."" Although event2 does happen, C6 is false, so the conjunction C7 is false.

Therefore C7 is False.
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- The hypothesis asks whether C7 is true or false.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1 and C2 state the same thing: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens.""
- C3 is ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Since C1 and C2 are identical, C3 is a tautology (C1 -> C1), so C3 is always true.
- C4 says ""C3 always holds."" Given C3 is a tautology, C4 is true.
- C5 says ""C4 does not hold."" That contradicts C4, so C5 is false (it cannot hold at any time).
- C6 says ""C5 eventually holds."" Since C5 is never true, C6 is false.
- The context also states event2 happened initially, so ""event2 happens"" is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C7
- C7 is the conjunction ""Event2 happens and C6 holds."" Event2 happens is true, but C6 is false, so the conjunction is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context, event2 happened initially and events alternate thereafter (event2 → event1 → event2 → ...), so event2 does occur (at least initially).

- C1 and C2 are the same statement (""If event1 happens, then event2 happens""). Thus C1 -> C2 is equivalent to P -> P, which is always true. So:
  - C3 (""If C1 holds, then C2 holds"") is a tautology and holds.
  - C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true.

- C5 (""C4 does not hold"") contradicts C4, so C5 is false (and cannot become true if C4 indeed always holds).

- C6 (""C5 eventually holds"") is therefore false, because C5 never holds.

- C7 is the conjunction ""Event2 happens and C6 holds"". Although event2 does happen, C6 is false, so the conjunction is false.

Therefore C7 is False."

Sample responses:
We want to know whether C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is True or False given the context.

1) Context summary:
- Initially event2 happened (so at time 0, event2 is true).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- (Also: if event1 happens then event2 must happen later — irrelevant here because event1 cannot occur after event2.)

2) Interpret the Ci conditions at the initial time and along the future:
- C1 and C2 are tautological in form (""if event2 happens then event2 happens"") and therefore hold whenever evaluated.
- C3 = (event1 happens) and C2. At time 0 event1 does not happen (only event2 did), so C3 is false at time 0.
- C4 = C1 and C3, so C4 is false at time 0 (because C3 is false).
- C5 = ""C4 holds in the next state."" After event2 no other events can happen, so in the next state event1 still does not happen and C3 (hence C4) is false, so C5 is false.
- C6 = event1 happens or C5 holds. Both disjuncts are false at time 0, and because no events can occur after event2, they remain false at all future times.
- C7 = ""C6 eventually holds."" Since C6 is false now and will never become true (no future event1, C5 never true), ""eventually C6"" is false.

Conclusion: C7 is False.
---

---
Step 1 — consequences of the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- The rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"" means no event (including event1) can occur at or after the initial state. So event1 never happens anywhere in the execution.

Step 2 — evaluate conditions
- C1 and C2: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" These are tautologies (P → P) and hold in every state.
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" Since event1 never happens, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C1 holds and C3 holds."" C1 is true but C3 is false, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" C4 is false in every state, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""Event1 happens or C5 holds."" Both disjuncts are false, so C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" Since C6 is false now and can never become true (no events can occur after the initial event2), C7 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Context implies event2 happens at the initial moment and, after any occurrence of event2, no further events can occur. So no event can occur after that initial event2.
- C1 (and identically C2) asserts: if event2 happens then event1 happens. But we know event2 does happen (initially) and no event can occur after that, so there is no way to ensure event1 happens after that event2; and nothing in the context says event1 happened before the initial event2. Therefore C1 is not guaranteed (false).
- C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") depends on C2 holding at some future point; since C2 is equivalent to C1 (which is false) there is no reason C3 would hold.
- C4, C5, C6 all depend on C1/C2/C3 or on event1 actually occurring. Given event1 does not follow the initial event2 and no information supports event1 having occurred earlier, C4 and C5 fail and thus C6 (event1 happens or C5 holds) also fails.
- C7 is C1 or C6. Both disjuncts are false, so C7 is false.
---

---
Goal: decide whether C7 is true.

Interpretation / facts:
- Initially event2 happens (so event2 is true at the initial time).
- After event2 no other events can happen → no event can occur after that initial event2.
- Therefore event1 never happens (it cannot happen after the initial event2, and there is no earlier time before ""initially"").

Evaluate each condition:
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Antecedent is true (event2 happens initially) but consequent is false (event1 never happens). So C1 is false.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 is false now and nothing changes later (no events later), so C2 will never become true. Thus C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 holds and event1 happens."" Both parts are false, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" C4 is false, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""Event1 happens or C5 holds."" Both disjuncts are false, so C6 is false.
- C7: ""C1 holds or C6 holds."" Both are false, so C7 is false.

Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. So event1 does not occur at any time (there is no opportunity for it to happen later).

Step 2 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautological implication (P → P), which is true even when event1 does not actually occur. So C1 holds (True).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 holds, C2 is False.
- C3: same as C1, so C3 holds (True).
- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds."" C2 is False, so C4 is False.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" C4 is False, so C5 is False.
- C6: same tautology again, so C6 holds (True).
- C7: ""C5 holds and C6 holds."" C5 is False, so C7 is False.

Step 1 — what’s being asked
You’re asking whether C7 is true or false given the listed claims and the context. I will evaluate each Ci in turn and then evaluate C7.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautological implication (A → A). It is true.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is true, C2 is false.
- C3: same as C1, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds."" C2 is false and C3 is true, so C4 (a conjunction with a false conjunct) is false.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" C4 is false, so C5 is false.
- C6: same tautology as C1/C3, so C6 is true.
- C7: ""C5 holds and C6 holds."" C5 is false and C6 is true, so C7 is false.

(The initial context about event2 happening and preventing other events does not change the truth of the tautological implications or the logical relations among the Ci; the truth-values above follow purely from the logical forms.)

The hypothesis asks whether C7 (""C6 always holds"", i.e. G C6) is true in the given scenario.

Step-by-step:

- C1 = (event2 or event1).
- C2 = (event1 → C1). This is a trivial tautology: whenever event1 happens, (event1 or event2) holds. So C2 is true at every state.
- C3 = always C2 (G C2). Since C2 holds at every state, C3 is true (globally).
- C4 = eventually C3 (F C3). If C3 holds at every state, then it certainly holds at some future state, so C4 is true.
- C5 = not C4 (¬F C3). But C4 is true, so C5 is false (at every state).
- C6 = eventually C5 (F C5). Since C5 is false at all times, there is no future state where C5 holds, so C6 is false.
- C7 = always C6 (G C6). Because C6 is false, C7 is false.

Therefore C7 is False.

You are asking whether C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true given the context.

Step-by-step:

- Context implies an infinite alternating sequence starting with event2 (initially event2, after event2 → event1, after event1 → event2), so at every step either event1 or event2 occurs.
- C1 (""event2 happens or event1 happens"") is therefore true (indeed true at every time).
- C2 (""if event1 happens then C1"") is true (if event1 happens then ""event1 or event2"" is true).
- C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true (C2 holds at every time).
- C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true (anything that always holds also eventually holds).
- C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is false (C4 does hold).
- C6 (""C5 eventually holds"") is false (C5 never holds).
- C7 (""C6 always holds"") is false (C6 does not hold).

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- C7 asserts: ""C6 always holds."" We must decide whether C7 is True or False.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" (A disjunction.)
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" That is: event1 -> (event2 or event1). This implication is a logical tautology (if event1 holds, then event1 or event2 holds).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is tautologically true whenever evaluated, C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" If C3 always holds, it certainly holds eventually, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" This contradicts the previous line, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" Since C5 is false (and cannot become true given the prior facts), C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" Since C6 is false, C7 is false.

Step 3 — event-context check (consistency)
- The given event rules (initially event2; after event2 then event1; after event1 then event2) produce an infinite alternation of event1 and event2, which does not rescue C5 or C6 — the logical chain above already determines truth values.

Sample responses:
We want to know whether C6 (""C5 always holds"") follows from the context.

Context summary:
- At the initial state, event2 happened.
- After any event1, event2 must occur.
- After any event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has occurred, no further events — including event1 — can occur later).

Step-by-step checking:
- Because event2 happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, event1 can never occur at any time (there is no moment after the initial event2 in which event1 can happen).
- C1 = ""event2 happens and event1 happens."" Since event1 never occurs, C1 is false in every state.
- C2 and C3 assert C1 holds in the next state; both are therefore false.
- C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is false because C3 never holds.
- C5 (C2 and C4) is false (both conjuncts are false).
- C6 (""C5 always holds"") is false because C5 does not hold (it fails already at the initial state).

Therefore C6 is False.

Answer: False

Reasoning, step by step:

1. From the context: initially event2 happened. Also, once event2 has happened, no other events can occur afterwards. So after the initial state there are no events at any later state.

2. C1 requires both event2 and event1 to happen (in the same state). Given the context, even if they could co-occur initially, no further states can have any events because event2 has occurred initially.

3. C2 says C1 holds in the next state. But the next state (after the initial event2) has no events, so C1 cannot hold there. Thus C2 is false.

4. C3 is the same assertion (C1 in the next state) and is false for the same reason. C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is therefore false. Hence C5 (C2 and C4) is false.

5. C6 asserts that C5 always holds. Since C5 is already false, C6 cannot be true.

Therefore C6 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Model the situation: at the initial state event1 has happened. The rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" means no future state can contain any event (in particular event2 never occurs in any future state). The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is then either vacuously satisfied (if event2 never occurs) or impossible to use (you can't have event2 then a later event1 because no events can occur after event1).

- C1 (""Event2 happens in the next state""): false in the initial state, because no events can occur after the initial event1.

- C2 (""C1 eventually holds"" i.e. eventually Event2 happens in the next state): false, because there is no future state where C1 becomes true (event2 never occurs).

- C3 (""eventually C2""), C4 (""eventually C3""): each is false for the same reason — there is no future point where the inner claim becomes true.

- C5 (""C4 always holds""): false because C4 is already false now (so it is not true at every future state).

- C6 (""C5 always holds"") and C7 (""C6 always holds""): both false (they quantify over a false claim).

Therefore C7 is False.

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- The question asks whether C7 (the nested temporal formula) holds given the context.
- Context: initially event1 has happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. So from the initial state onward, no further events ever occur (in particular, event2 never occurs).
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" This is false (there are no events after event1, so event2 does not happen).
- C2: ""Eventually C1"" — since C1 is false now and will remain false forever, C2 is false.
- C3 and C4 (more nested ""eventually"") are likewise false.
- C5: ""C4 always holds"" is false because C4 is already false.
- C6 and then C7 (""always"" of a false formula, then again) are false as well.

Therefore C7 is False.
---
The hypothesis asks whether C7 (the nested always/eventually statement) is true given the system constraints.

Step 1 — system facts:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen → once event1 has occurred, event2 can never occur later.
- After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur).

Step 2 — evaluate conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Since event1 already happened and no further events can occur, event2 cannot happen in the next state. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" If C1 is false now and no events can occur later, C1 will never become true, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Same reasoning: C2 is false now and will never become true, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" False for the same reason.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" C4 is false, so ""always C4"" is false.
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" C5 is false, so C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" C6 is false, so C7 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked
- We must decide whether C7 (""C6 does not hold"") is True or False given the context and the definitions C1–C7.

Step 2 — interpret the context and the conditions
- Context: initially (in the initial state s0) event2 happened. After event1 or after event2, no further events can happen (so in the next state s1 and onward no events occur).
- Interpret C1–C7 as state/temporal formulas evaluated from the initial state s0:
  - C1: event2 does not happen (in the current state).
  - C2: same as C1.
  - C3: C2 always holds (globally from the current state).
  - C4: C1 holds or C3 holds.
  - C5: C4 holds in the next state.
  - C6: C5 does not hold (negation of C5).
  - C7: C6 does not hold (negation of C6).

Step 3 — evaluate at the initial state s0 and the next state s1
- At s0: event2 happened, so
  - C1 is false (event2 does happen at s0).
  - C2 is false.
  - C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false because C2 is already false at s0.
  - C4 = C1 or C3 = false or false = false.
  - C5 = ""C4 holds in next state"" — evaluate C4 at s1 below.
- At s1: by context, no events occur (since event2 happened at s0). Thus at s1:
  - event2 does not happen, so C1 (and C2) are true at s1.
  - C3 (""C2 always holds"" from s1 onward) is true because from s1 onward no events occur, so C2 holds at every future state.
  - Hence C4 (C1 or C3) is true at s1.
- Therefore at s0, C5 (""C4 holds in the next state"") is true.
- Then at s0:
  - C6 = ""C5 does not hold"" is false (because C5 is true).
  - C7 = ""C6 does not hold"" is true (negation of the false C6).

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so the initial state is terminal — there is no next state).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is false because event2 did happen initially.
- C2: same as C1, so false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is false in the initial (and only) state, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C1 holds or C3 holds."" Both are false, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" There is no next state (terminal after event2), so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" C5 is false, so C6 is true.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" C6 is true, so C7 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — interpret the facts
- Initially event2 happened. So at the initial state the proposition ""event2 does not happen"" is false.

Step 2 — evaluate C1..C4 at the initial state
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" — false (because event2 did happen initially).
- C2: same as C1 — false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — false, because C2 is already false now.
- C4: ""C1 holds or C3 holds"" — false or false → false.

Step 3 — C5..C7 (use standard next-state semantics)
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" Whether there is a next state or not, C5 does not hold: if there is no next state, Xφ is false; if there is a next state, C4 was already false initially and nothing in the premises makes it become true later. So C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold"" — true (since C5 is false).
- C7: ""C6 does not hold"" — false (since C6 is true).

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C6 (C2 holds or C5 holds) is True or False given the context and the listed conditions. Final answer must be exactly ""True"" or ""False"".

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., any occurrence of event2 requires a later event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen (once event1 has happened, the future is eventless).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: Event2 eventually happens. Given ""after event1 no other events can happen"" and event1 already happened initially, no events can occur after that, so event2 cannot occur at any later time. There is no indication event2 occurred before the initial event1. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — since C1 never becomes true in the future, C2 is false.
- C3: same as C2, false.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens."" An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 holds and event2 happens."" C4 is true but event2 does not happen, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C2 holds or C5 holds"" — both C2 and C5 are false, so C6 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C6 is True or False given the context and the listed conditions. Final answer must be either ""True"" or ""False"".

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened (so at the start event1 has occurred).
- After event1, no other events can happen — event1 is terminal.
- Therefore, no events can occur at any later time after the initial state.
- In particular, event2 cannot occur at any time after the initial event1. There is no earlier time than the initial state in this description, so event2 cannot happen at all.

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given the context this is false (event2 cannot happen).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" This is essentially equivalent to ""event2 eventually happens"" (nested eventualities collapse), so C2 is false.
- C3: same as C2, so false.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens."" Because C3 is false, the implication is vacuously true — C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 holds and event2 happens."" C4 is true but event2 does not happen, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C2 holds or C5 holds."" Both C2 and C5 are false, so C6 is false.

Final answer
False
---
False

Brief justification (concise):
- Initially event1 has occurred and ""after event1 no other events can happen"", so event2 cannot occur at any time.
- Therefore C1 (event2 eventually happens) is false, so C2 and C3 (which assert eventual truth of C1) are false.
- C4 (C3 ⇒ event2) is vacuously true because C3 is false, but C5 (C4 ∧ event2) is false because event2 does not occur.
- Hence C6 (C2 ∨ C5) is false."

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
Step 1 — set up the timeline and semantics
- We use standard discrete-state temporal reasoning (states 0,1,2,...). A bare proposition like ""event1 happens"" means it holds in that state.
- Context:
  - At state 0: event1 is true.
  - ""After event1, no other events can happen"" ⇒ at every state n ≥ 1 neither event1 nor event2 occurs.
  - ""After event2, event1 must happen"" puts a constraint only on runs where event2 occurs; in our run event2 never occurs, so it imposes no additional occurrences.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions at state 0
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" At state 0 event1 is true but event2 is false, so C1 is false at state 0.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Therefore C2 is true at state 0.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" At state 1, event1 does not hold, so C1 is vacuously true there and C2 is false at state 1. Hence C3 is false at state 0.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 is false at every state (because C2 is only true at state 0 and C3 requires C2 at the next state), so C4 is false at state 0.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" Since C4 never holds, C5 is false at state 0.
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" C5 is already false at state 0, so C6 is false at state 0.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" Since C6 is false at state 0, C7 is true.

Step 1 — understand the setting

- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" True (negation of the false C1).

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked
We must decide whether C7 holds (is true) in the system given the context (initially event2 occurred, and after event1 event2 must occur, and after event2 event1 must occur).

Step 2 — interpret the context
Given the two ""after"" constraints and the initial event2, the system forces an infinite alternation:
state0: event2 happens
state1: event1 happens
state2: event2 happens
state3: event1 happens
… and so on.

Step 3 — evaluate the Ci formulae on this trace
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" — true at event2 states, false at event1 states.
- C2: ""C1 and event2"" — true exactly at event2 states (because there event1 is false and event2 true); false at event1 states.
- C3: ""C2 or event2"" — since event2 is true at event2 states, C3 is true at event2 states; at event1 states both disjuncts are false, so C3 is false there.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — at an event2 state the next state is an event1 state where C3 is false, so C4 is false at event2 states; at an event1 state the next state is an event2 state where C3 is true, so C4 is true at event1 states.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" — thus true at event2 states (where C4 is false) and false at event1 states (where C4 is true).
- C6: ""C5 always holds"" (globally) — false, because C5 is false at event1 states.
- C7: ""C6 holds or event1 happens"" — at state0 (initial, an event2 state) C6 is false and event1 does not happen, so C7 is false there. (More generally, at event2 states C7 is false; at event1 states C7 is true because event1 happens there.)

Step 4 — conclusion
C7 is not true in the initial state; overall the statement ""C7 holds"" (interpreted in the initial state) is False.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Timeline and rules:
   - s0 is the initial state and event2 happened there.
   - After an event2, event1 must happen in the next state; after an event1, event2 must happen next.
   - Therefore the sequence alternates: s0: event2, s1: event1, s2: event2, s3: event1, ...

2. Evaluate the C-conditions at s0 (the current/initial state) and following states:
   - C1 (event1 does not happen at s0): True (s0 has event2).
   - C2 (C1 and event2 at s0): True.
   - C3 (C2 or event2 at s0): True.
   - C4 (C3 holds in the next state): asks whether C3 is true at s1. At s1, event1 happens, so C1 and C2 are false there and event2 is false, hence C3 is false at s1. So C4 is False at s0.
   - C5 (C4 does not hold at s0): True.
   - C6 (C5 always holds): means for every state k, C3 must be false at k+1. But at s2 (k=1), event2 holds, so C3(s2) is true (since event2(s2) is true). Thus C5 does not hold at s1, so C6 is False.
   - C7 (C6 or event1 at s0): since C6 is False and event1 does not occur at s0, C7 is False.

Therefore C7 is False.

Step 1 — what’s asked:
We must decide whether C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true or false given the listed conditions and the context.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition in order:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is p → p, a tautology, so C1 holds (True).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 holds, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" C2 is false, so C3 is true.
- C4: same as C1, a tautology, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" Both are true, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" But C5 holds, so C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" That asserts C6 is (always) true. But C6 is false, so C7 is false.

Step 3 — conclusion:
C7 is False. Final answer: False

Identify question: Is C7 (""C6 always holds"") true or false?

Step-by-step evaluation:
1. C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (true). So C1 = True.
2. C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is True, C2 = False.
3. C3: ""C2 does not hold."" C2 is False, so C3 = True.
4. C4: same as C1, so C4 = True.
5. C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" Both are True, so C5 = True.
6. C6: ""C5 does not hold."" Since C5 is True, C6 = False.
7. C7: ""C6 always holds."" C6 is False, so it cannot always hold; C7 = False.

Final answer:
False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context:
   - s0 (initial): event1 is true.
   - The rules ""after event1, event2 must happen"" and ""after event2, event1 must happen"" force the alternating trace
     s0: event1, s1: event2, s2: event1, s3: event2, … (event2 holds at every odd state, event1 at every even state).

2. Evaluate the conditions at the initial state s0:
   - C1: ""Event2 always happens"" (i.e. event2 holds in every state) — false, because at s0 event2 is false.
   - C2 is the same as C1 → false.
   - C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds"" — at s0, event2 is false and C2 is false, so C3 is false at s0.
   - C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — at s1 event2 is true, so C3 is true at s1; therefore C4 is true at s0.
   - C5 is the same as C1 → false.
   - C6: ""C4 holds or C5 holds"" — C4 is true, so C6 is true at s0.
   - C7: ""C1 holds and C6 holds"" — C1 is false and C6 is true, so C7 is false.

Since C7 is a conjunction that includes the false C1, C7 is False.
---
Plan/assumptions
- ""After X"" = X holds in a state implies the other event holds in the immediately following state.
- ""Always"" = holds in every state (globally).
- Time 0 is the initial state where ""event1 happened"" (only that is given).

Step-by-step
1. From the context: at time 0, event1 is true.
2. From ""after event1, event2 must happen"": at time 1, event2 must be true.
3. From ""after event2, event1 must happen"": at time 2, event1 must be true; repeating gives an alternating sequence event1 (even times), event2 (odd times).
4. C1 says ""Event2 always happens"" (i.e. at every time). But at time 0 event2 is not forced by the context, so event2 need not hold at time 0. Therefore C1 is false.
5. C4 (and hence C6) is true: C3 = ""event2 or C2"". At time 1 event2 is true, so C3 holds at time1, so C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is true from time0; C6 = C4 or C5 is therefore true.
6. C7 = C1 and C6. Since C1 is false (even though C6 is true), C7 is false.

Final answer
False
---
We work in the usual linear-time model induced by the context: s0 is the initial state with event1 true and event2 false; the rules ""after event1, event2 must happen"" and ""after event2, event1 must happen"" force an alternating sequence:
- s0: event1 (no event2)
- s1: event2
- s2: event1
- s3: event2
- … and so on.

Interpret ""Event2 always happens"" as the global property G(event2) (event2 holds in every state). Now evaluate the Ci at the initial state s0:

1. C1: G(event2). This is false, because event2 is false in s0 (and in every even state).
2. C2: G(event2). Same as C1, so false.
3. C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds"" — at s0, event2 is false and C2 is false, so C3 is false at s0.
4. C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" = X C3. At s0 the next state is s1; at s1 event2 is true, so C3 is true at s1; therefore C4 is true at s0.
5. C5: G(event2). Same as C1/C2, so false.
6. C6: C4 or C5. At s0 this is true (C4 true, C5 false).
7. C7: C1 and C6. At s0 this is false and true, hence false.

Therefore C7 is False. Final answer:

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked
- We are asked whether C6 (""C4 holds and C5 holds"") is true given the context and the listed conditions.

Step 2 — evaluate the context and C1–C5
- Context: initially event2 happened; after event2 event1 must happen; after event1 event2 must happen. So both event2 and event1 do occur.  
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" — True (follows from the context).
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" — True (C1 already includes event1, so the implication is satisfied).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" — True (C2 is a valid implication as noted, so it holds).
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" — False (contradicts C3 which is true).
- C5: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" — True (same as C2).

Step 3 — evaluate C6
- C6 is ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" C5 holds but C4 is false, so the conjunction is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must determine whether C6 (""C4 holds and C5 holds"") is true or false given the context and the listed conditions.

Step 2 — evaluate the context and C1
- The context: event2 happened initially; after event2 event1 must happen; after event1 event2 must happen. So both event2 and event1 do occur.
- Therefore C1 (""Event2 happens and event1 happens"") is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C2 and C5
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Given C1 already asserts event1, the implication (C1 → event1) is logically true.
- C5 is the same implication as C2; so C5 is also true.

Step 4 — evaluate C3 and C4
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is a logically true implication, C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This contradicts C3, so C4 is false.

Step 5 — evaluate C6
- C6 is ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" C5 is true but C4 is false, so the conjunction is false.

Final answer: False
---
We are asked whether C6 (""C4 holds and C5 holds"") is true.

1) From the context: event2 happened initially, and after event2 event1 must happen, and after event1 event2 must happen. So both event2 and event1 do occur.  
2) C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" — true given the context.  
3) C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"" — true (it follows directly from C1, since C1 includes event1).  
4) C3: ""C2 always holds"" — C2 is a logical truth here, so C3 holds.  
5) C4: ""C3 does not hold"" — false, because C3 does hold.  
6) C5: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"" — same as C2, so true.  
7) C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds"" — requires C4 true and C5 true; since C4 is false, C6 is false.

Sample responses:
Goal: decide whether C7 is true or false under the given setup.

Setup (timeline):
- t0: event2 happened (initially).
- After any event2 the next event is event1.
- After any event1 the next event is event2.
So the sequence of time points is: t0: event2, t1: event1, t2: event2, t3: event1, … (alternating).

Evaluate the conditions pointwise (at an arbitrary time t):

- Let E2(t) mean ""event2 happens at t"". Then E2 is true at even indices (t0, t2, …) and false at odd indices.

- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — equivalent to E2(t). So C1 true exactly at even times.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" = not C1 = not E2(t) — true exactly at odd times.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" = not(not E2(t)) = E2(t) — true exactly at even times.
- C4: ""Event2 happens and C3 holds"" = E2(t) and E2(t) = E2(t) — true exactly at even times.
- C5: ""C4 always holds"" (globally from the current time) — false at every time because C4 fails at the odd times that follow (the system alternates, so C4 is not true at all future times).
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds"" — false, since C5 is false at every time, there is no future time where C5 becomes true.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds"" — false, since C6 is false everywhere, there is no time at which C6 becomes true.

Conclusion: C7 is False.

False
---

---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C7 is true or false, given the context and the definitions C1–C7.

Step 2 — understand the context (temporal rules)
- Initially event2 happens.
- After any event2, event1 must happen (so an event1 follows every event2).
- After any event1, event2 must happen (so an event2 follows every event1).
- Thus the system forces an infinite alternation: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens"" — this is just equivalent to “event2 happens.” Since event2 happens initially, C1 holds at the initial moment.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — this is ¬C1, so C2 is false at the initial moment (and whenever C1 holds).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — this is ¬C2. Since C2 is ¬C1, C3 is equivalent to C1. So C3 holds exactly when event2 holds.
- C4: ""Event2 happens and C3 holds"" — since C3 ≡ C1 ≡ event2, C4 is equivalent to event2. So C4 holds exactly at those times when event2 occurs (i.e., at every other step in the alternating sequence).
- C5: ""C4 always holds"" — this means “event2 holds at all times.” But because event1 must occur after each event2, there are times when event2 does not hold (the event1 steps). Therefore C5 is false (it does not hold always).
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds"" — since C5 never holds at any time (there is never a point from which event2 holds at every future time), C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds"" — because C6 is false at all times, C7 is also false.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C7 is False.

- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" ¬C4, so False.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" There is no next state (no events can happen after the initial state), so a ""next"" claim is false. Thus C6 is False.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" Since C6 is false at the current (and only) state, C7 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Step-by-step reasoning

1. From the context: initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. So event2 never happens at any point.

2. Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" True (we know event2 never happens).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" False (because C1 is true).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" False (C2 is false now and will never become true).
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" True (because C3 is false).
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" False (C4 is true).
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" There is no next state (after event1 nothing else can happen), so ""holds in the next state"" is false here. Thus C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" Since C6 is false at the current (initial) state, C7 is false.

Therefore C7 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning, step by step:
- Initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. So event2 never happens.
- C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is true.
- C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is the negation of C1, so C2 is false.
- C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is false because C2 is false and cannot become true (no further events can change it).
- C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is true (negation of a false statement).
- C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is false.
- C6 (""C5 holds in the next state"") is false (C5 is false and there is no way for it to become true).
- C7 (""C6 always holds"") is false because C6 is false.

Therefore C7 is False."

Step-by-step evaluation:
- Context: initially event2 happened; after event2 event1 must happen; after event1 event2 must happen. So event2 has occurred and event1 will occur (and they alternate).
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True (it already happened initially).
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" True (C1 is true, and event2 also happened).
- C3: same as C2, so True.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" False (C3 holds).
- C5: ""Event1 happens or C4 holds."" C4 is false, so C5 reduces to ""Event1 happens."" From the context, event1 must happen after the initial event2, so C5 is True.
- C6: ""If C2 holds, then C5 holds."" Antecedent C2 is True and consequent C5 is True, so the implication is True.

Final answer: True
---
You ask whether C6 (""If C2 holds, then C5 holds"") is True or False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1. From the context: event2 happened initially; after event2 event1 must happen; after event1 event2 must happen. So both event2 and event1 do occur (event2 already occurred and the rules force event1 then event2, etc.). In particular, event1 happens and event2 eventually happens.  

2. Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True (it already happened).
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" True (C1 holds, and event2 also happens).
- C3: same as C2, so True.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" False (C3 holds).
- C5: ""Event1 happens or C4 holds."" True (event1 happens).
- C6: ""If C2 holds, then C5 holds."" C2 is true and C5 is true, so the implication is true.

Conclusion: C6 is True.
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C6 (""If C2 holds, then C5 holds"") is True or False given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — use the context to evaluate atomic facts
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2 must come event1, and after event1 must come event2. Thus event1 will occur (immediately after the initial event2) and event2 will occur again later. So Event2 eventually happens (C1 is True), and Event1 happens (at least once) as well.

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: Event2 eventually happens — True (from context).
- C2: Event2 happens or C1 holds — True (C1 is True, so the disjunction holds).
- C3: same as C2 — True.
- C4: C3 does not hold — False (because C3 holds).
- C5: Event1 happens or C4 holds — True (Event1 happens, so the disjunction holds).
- C6: ""If C2 holds, then C5 holds"" — antecedent C2 is True and consequent C5 is True, so the implication is True.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- C7 is the statement ""C6 holds in the next state"" (i.e. X C6). We must decide whether that is true given the context.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions in the initial state
- Context: initially event2 happened; then event1 must happen; after event1 no other events can happen.
- C1, C2, C3: each is ""event2 eventually happens."" Because event2 has already happened initially, each of C1–C3 is true in the initial state.
- C4 = C2 and C3 ⇒ true.
- C5 = C1 and C4 ⇒ true.
- C6 = ""eventually C5"" (F C5). Since C5 is true now, F C5 is true in the initial state (eventually can be satisfied at the current state).

Step 3 — evaluate C6 in the next state
- The next state must be the state where event1 happens (by the context).
- After event1, no other events can happen; therefore in the future of the next state, event2 will not occur again.
- From the next state's perspective, ""event2 eventually happens"" (C1/C2/C3) is false, so C4 and C5 are false in that next state and in all its future states.
- Hence ""eventually C5"" (C6) is false in the next state.

Step 4 — conclusion about C7
- C7 asserts that C6 holds in the next state; we showed C6 is false in the next state.

Final answer: False
---
False

Step-by-step reasoning:

- From the context, the execution is: initially event2 has happened, then event1 must happen, and after event1 no further events occur.

- C1, C2, C3 (""Event2 eventually happens"") are true in the initial state because event2 has already occurred.

- C4 = C2 and C3 is true. C5 = C1 and C4 is true. Since C5 holds now, C6 (""C5 eventually holds"") is true in the initial state (it holds immediately).

- C7 asserts that C6 holds in the next state. The next state is the state after event1. In that state no further events can happen, so event2 will not happen in that state's future. Therefore C1–C3 are false in the next state, C4 and C5 are false, and C6 (""C5 eventually holds"") is false there.

Thus C7 is False.

Final answer:

---
First identify the question: C7 is the formula ""If event1 happens, then C6 holds."" We must decide whether C7 is true given the context.

Reasoning through the conditions and context:

- Context facts:
  - Initially event1 happened (so event1 does happen).
  - After event1, event2 must happen (so because event1 happened initially, event2 will occur at some point).
  - After event2, no other events can happen.

- Evaluate the Ci:
  - C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Given the context, event2 does happen, so C1 is false.
  - C2: ""C1 always holds"" — since C1 is false, C2 is false.
  - C3: same as C1, so false.
  - C4: C2 or C3 — false ∨ false = false.
  - C5: ""Eventually C4"" — since C4 never holds, C5 is false.
  - C6: ""Always C5"" — since C5 is false, C6 is false.

- Now C7: ""If event1 happens, then C6 holds."" The antecedent (event1 happens) is true (it happened initially), but the consequent C6 is false. Therefore the implication is false.

Final answer: False
---
Goal: determine whether C7 (""If event1 happens, then C6 holds"") is true given the context.

Context summary:
- Initially, event1 happened. (So event1 does happen.)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (So event2 will occur sometime after event1.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (event2 is terminal.)

Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is false (context guarantees event2 does happen).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3: ""Event2 does not happen."" Same as C1, so false.
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" False or false = false.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" C4 never holds, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" Since C5 is false, C6 is false.

Now C7: ""If event1 happens, then C6 holds.""
- The antecedent ""event1 happens"" is true (it happened initially).
- The consequent C6 is false.
- A true antecedent with a false consequent makes the implication false.

Therefore C7 is False. Final answer: False"

Sample responses:
We want to know whether C7 (""Event2 happens and C6 holds"") is true given the context.

Context summary:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so event2 can never occur after the initial event1).
- After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant here because event2 never occurs).

Evaluate the conditions step by step:
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" False (event1 happens but event2 cannot occur).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" True (negation of C1).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" True (C2 holds immediately, so it holds eventually).
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" True (at every time point C2 holds immediately, so at every time point C3 is true).
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" True (C4 holds now).
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" False (C5 does hold).
- C7: ""Event2 happens and C6 holds."" False (event2 does not happen, and C6 is false).

Therefore C7 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the background: event1 happened initially, and after event1 no other events can happen. Therefore event2 cannot occur at any time.

2. C1 (event1 and event2) is false because event2 cannot happen (event1 is true but event2 is false).

3. C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true (negation of C1).

4. C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true because C2 already holds (so it holds at some time).

5. C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true: since C2 holds permanently, C3 holds at every time.

6. C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true (C4 holds now).

7. C6 (""C5 does not hold"") is false because C5 does hold.

8. C7 (""event2 happens and C6 holds"") is a conjunction of a false (event2 does not happen) and a false (C6 false), so C7 is false.
---
Step 1 — identify the question:
- We must determine whether C7 (""Event2 happens and C6 holds"") is true given the context and the chain of conditions C1–C6.

Step 2 — understand the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 occurs (which it did initially), no event (including event2) can ever happen afterwards.
- After event2, event1 must happen. (This is irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur after the initial event1.)

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions in order:
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" False, because event2 cannot happen after the initial event1.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" True (negation of C1).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" True — C2 already holds now, so it holds at some (the current) time.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" True — C3 is true now and remains true (C2 is a persistent fact), so C3 holds at all times.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" True — C4 holds now.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" False (since C5 is true).

Step 4 — evaluate C7:
- C7 is ""Event2 happens and C6 holds."" Event2 never happens (given the context), and C6 is false. The conjunction is therefore false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked
We must decide whether C7 (C1 holds and C6 holds) is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context and the conditions
- Context: ""Initially, event1 happened."" So in the initial state event1 has occurred.
- C1, C2, C3 each assert ""Event1 does not happen."" That is false in the initial state because event1 did happen.
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — this would require C3 to be true in all states, but C3 is already false in the initial state.
- C5: ""If C2 holds, then C4 holds."" Since C2 is false in the initial state, the implication C5 is vacuously true there.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" Whether this is true or false depends on the next state, but it doesn’t matter for the final conjunction if C1 is false now.
- C7: ""C1 holds and C6 holds."" This requires C1 to be true in the initial state.

Step 3 — conclusion
C1 is false in the initial state (because event1 did happen), so the conjunction C7 is false regardless of C6.

Final answer:
False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Context says initially event1 happened. So at the initial state ""event1 happened"" is true.
- C1, C2, C3 each assert ""Event1 does not happen."" That is false in the initial state (because event1 did happen).
- C4 says C3 always holds. Since C3 is false at the initial state, C4 is false (it cannot be true always).
- C5 is the implication ""If C2 holds, then C4 holds."" An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C5 is true at the initial state.
- After event1 no other events can happen, so at the next state event1 does not happen. Thus at the next state C2 is true, C3 is true, and from that point onward event1 never happens so C4 is true there. Therefore C5 is true at the next state, so C6 (""C5 holds in the next state"") is true.
- C7 is the conjunction ""C1 holds and C6 holds."" C6 is true but C1 is false, so the conjunction C7 is false.

Therefore C7 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- C7 is the conjunction ""C1 holds and C6 holds"". We must decide whether C7 is true given the context.

Step 2 — use the context
- The context states: initially event1 happened.
- C1 says ""Event1 does not happen."" That directly contradicts the context, so C1 is false in the initial state.

Step 3 — conclude about C7
- Since C7 requires C1 to hold (C7 = C1 ∧ C6) and C1 is false, C7 is false regardless of C6.

(Additional note: C6 would also fail because after event1 no further states/events occur, so there is no next state in which C5 could hold, but this is not needed to conclude C7 is false.)

Answer: False

Reasoning (step by step):

1. Interpret the context as standard temporal requirements: initially at time 0 event2 has occurred; whenever event1 occurs, event2 must occur afterward; whenever event2 occurs, event1 must occur afterward. That forces an infinite alternation of event2, event1, event2, ...

2. C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True — it already happened initially and will continue to occur repeatedly.

3. C2: ""C1 always holds."" True — from every state in the infinite execution there will be an event2 later, so C1 holds at every state.

4. C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" True — since C2 is true at all states, it is true at the next state.

5. C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" True — C3 already holds, so it certainly holds at some (in fact every) future state.

6. C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" True — C4 holds at the next state for the same reasons.

7. C6: ""C5 always holds."" True — C5 holds at every state (the alternation enforces the nested properties at every position).

8. C7: ""C6 does not hold."" This is the negation of a true statement, so C7 is false.

Therefore C7 is False.
---
The hypothesis asks whether C7 (""C6 does not hold"") is true or false.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- From the context we get an alternating infinite trace: initially event2 holds; after any state with event2 the next state must have event1, and after any state with event1 the next state must have event2. So the sequence is event2, event1, event2, event1, ...
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True (it holds now at the initial state).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" True — from every state of the infinite alternation there is a (possibly current or next) state where event2 holds.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" True — since C2 holds at every state, it holds at the next state.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" True — C3 already holds, so it holds eventually.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" True — C4 holds at every state, so it holds in the next state.
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" True — C5 holds at every state.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" This is the negation of a true statement, so C7 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the assumptions: initially event2 happened, and after any event2 there must be an event1, and after any event1 there must be an event2. That forces an infinite alternation …event2, event1, event2, event1, … starting from the initial event2.

2. C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True — event2 already happened initially and will recur infinitely often.

3. C2: ""C1 always holds."" True — at every state of the run there will be a future event2, so from every state C1 is true.

4. C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" True — moving to the next state the same alternation continues, so C2 is true there.

5. C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" True — C3 already holds (and will hold again), so it holds at some future state.

6. C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" True — at the next state C4 holds.

7. C6: ""C5 always holds."" True — the pattern makes C5 true at every state.

8. C7: ""C6 does not hold."" This is the negation of a true statement, so C7 is false.

Therefore C7 is False."

   - ""After event2, event1 must happen"" means: if event2 holds at state i then event1 holds at state i+1.
   - ""After event1, event2 must happen"" means: if event1 holds at state i then event2 holds at state i+1.
   Thus the states alternate: s0: e2, s1: e1, s2: e2, s3: e1, ...

2. Translate the hypothesis formulas:
   - C1: e1 ∧ e2 (both hold in the same state).
   - C2: e2 → C1 (if e2 then e1∧e2 in the same state).
   - C3: X(C2) (C2 holds in the next state).
   - C4: same as C2 (e2 → C1).
   - C5: C3 ∧ C4.
   - C6: X(C5) (C5 holds in the next state).

3. Evaluate C2 on the timeline:
   - At states where e2 is true (s0, s2, ...), C1 is false (e1 is false there), so C2 is false.
   - At states where e2 is false (s1, s3, ...), C2 is true (antecedent false).

4. Evaluate C5 at s1 (since C6 requires C5 at s1):
   - C3 at s1 requires C2 at s2; but C2 at s2 is false (s2 has e2), so C3 is false.
   - C4 at s1 is (e2 → C1) evaluated at s1; e2 is false at s1, so C4 is true.
   - Therefore C5 = C3 ∧ C4 is false at s1.

5. C6 = X(C5) is false at s0 because C5 is false at s1.

Therefore C6 is False.

First, what the hypothesis asks: is C6 true (in the initial state, given the context that s0 is the initial state)?

Interpretation of the context as a trace of states:
- s0 (initial): event2 holds.
- After event2, event1 must happen ⇒ s1: event1 holds.
- After event1, event2 must happen ⇒ s2: event2 holds.
So the trace alternates: s0: E2, s1: E1, s2: E2, s3: E1, …

Now evaluate the conditions at states:

- C1: ""event1 happens and event2 happens"" — this requires both E1 and E2 true in the same state. In our trace no state has both true, so C1 is false at every state.

- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"" — as a material implication E2 → C1.
  - At states where E2 is true (s0, s2, …), C1 is false, so the implication is false at those states.
  - At states where E2 is false (s1, s3, …), the implication is true (vacuously).

- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — at a given state s, C3 is true iff C2 is true at the successor state.
  - At s0: check s1 — at s1 E2 is false so C2 is true there ⇒ C3 is true at s0.
  - At s1: check s2 — at s2 E2 is true and C1 is false, so C2 is false at s2 ⇒ C3 is false at s1.

- C4: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds"" — same as C2 but evaluated at the current state.
  - At s0 this is false (E2 true but C1 false).
  - At s1 this is true (E2 false → implication true).

- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds""
  - At s0: C3 true and C4 false ⇒ C5 is false at s0.
  - At s1: C3 false and C4 true ⇒ C5 is false at s1.

- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state"" — at s0, C6 is true iff C5 holds at s1. We just found C5 is false at s1, so C6 is false at s0.

Therefore C6 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Model the timeline as discrete states:
   - State S0 (initial): event2 happens (given). By the “after event2, event1 must happen” rule, event1 does not hold in S0 but must hold in the next state.
   - State S1: event1 happens (and event2 does not).
   - State S2: by “after event1, event2 must happen”, event2 holds (and event1 does not).
   - The pattern alternates: S0: event2, S1: event1, S2: event2, S3: event1, …

2. Evaluate the propositions:
   - C1 = event1 ∧ event2. In this alternating model no state has both events true simultaneously, so C1 is false in every state.
   - C2 and C4 are the same formula: event2 → C1. Because C1 is always false, C2 (and C4) is false in any state where event2 holds (e.g. S0 and S2), and true in states where event2 does not hold (vacuously).
   - C3 = “C2 holds in the next state.” At S0, next state is S1; C2 is true in S1 (since event2 is false there), so C3 is true at S0. At S1, next state S2 has event2 true, so C2 is false in S2; hence C3 is false at S1.
   - C5 = C3 ∧ C4. At S0: C3 is true but C4 is false (since event2 holds in S0), so C5 is false at S0. At S1: C3 is false and C4 is true, so C5 is false at S1.

3. C6 = “C5 holds in the next state.” At the initial state S0, the next state is S1 and we just saw C5 is false in S1, so C6 is false at S0.

Therefore C6 is False."

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s asked
- We must decide whether C5 (C3 holds and C4 holds) is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — evaluate conditions using the context
- Context facts:
  - Initially, event1 happened. So event1 has occurred (hence “event1 eventually happens” is true).
  - After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur after event1).
  - After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

- C1: “Event1 eventually happens.” True (it already happened initially).
- C2: “C1 does not hold.” False (C1 holds).
- C3: “Event1 happens and C2 holds.” Requires C2 true, but C2 is false → C3 is False.
- C4: same as C3 → False.
- C5: “C3 holds and C4 holds.” Both C3 and C4 are false → C5 is False.

Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C5 (""C3 holds and C4 holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- Context: initially event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, no other events can happen. So the actual event sequence is event1 (initial) → event2 → end.
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True (it happened initially).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" False (it denies a true statement).
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" False, because C2 is false (a conjunction with a false conjunct is false).
- C4: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" Same as C3, so also false.
- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" Requires both C3 and C4 true; both are false, so C5 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
You are asking whether C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true given the context.

Step 1 — context summary:
- event1 happened initially.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 does happen).
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" True (matches the context rule).
- C2: same as C1, so True.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" False (because C2 holds).
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" False (C3 is false).
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" False (C4 is false).
- C6: ""C1 holds or C5 holds."" True (C1 holds, so the disjunction is true).
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" Since C1 is a valid rule of the scenario (hence always true), C6 (which relies on C1) is always true. Therefore C7 is True.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- C7 says: ""C6 always holds."" We need to decide whether that is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — evaluate conditions from the context
- Context: Initially event1 happened. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, no other events can happen.
  This means whenever event1 happens, event2 happens (and the sequence ends after event2).

Step 3 — check each Ci
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" True (given the context rule).
- C2: same as C1, so True.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" False (since C2 holds).
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" False (C3 is false).
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" False (C4 is false).
- C6: ""C1 holds or C5 holds."" True (because C1 holds).
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" Since C1 is a global consequence of the context (whenever event1 happens event2 must happen), C6 (which depends on C1) holds; therefore C6 holds always and C7 is True.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
C7 asserts: ""C6 always holds."" We must determine whether that is true given the context and the other Ci.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This matches the context, so C1 is true.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is true, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" C3 is false, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" C4 is false, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C1 holds or C5 holds."" C1 is true, so the disjunction C6 is true.

Step 3 — C7: ""C6 always holds""
C6 is true because C1 is true (and C1 is a valid consequence of the given context). Therefore C6 holds (and, given it follows from the contextually true C1, it holds consistently). So C7 is true.

Sample responses:
The hypothesis asks whether C6 is true.

Context facts:
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 does happen (contradicting ""event2 does not happen"").
- After event2, no other events can happen (so no events occur after that initial event2).
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs, event2 must occur afterwards).

Examine conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is false because event2 happened initially.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" C1 is false, so C2 is false (regardless of event1).
- C3: same as C1, so false.

- C5: ""C3 and C4 hold."" Both are false, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C2 and C5 hold."" Both are false, so C6 is false.

Therefore C6 is False.
---
False

Reasoning, step by step:
- The context states event2 happened initially.
- It also states that after event2 no other events can happen, so no events can occur after that initial event2.
- Because event2 already happened initially and nothing can occur after it, event1 cannot occur (it cannot be before the initial event2, and it cannot be after).
- Therefore C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is false.
- C2 and C4 require C1 to hold and/or require event1 to happen, so they are false.
- C3 repeats C1 and is false. C5 (C3 and C4) is false. Finally, C6 (C2 and C5) is false.

True

Reasoning, step by step:

- From the context: initially event2 occurred, and after event2 event1 must occur, and after event1 no further events can happen. So event1 does indeed eventually happen. Therefore C1 and C2 (both ""Event1 eventually happens"") are true.

- C3 (""If C2 holds, then event1 happens""): since C2 is true and event1 does happen, C3 is true. Moreover, at any point in the timeline C3 is true (before event1 the antecedent holds and the consequent later holds; after event1 the antecedent is false and the implication is vacuously true), so C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true.

- C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is the negation of C4, so C5 is false.

- C6 (""C5 does not hold"") is the negation of C5, so C6 is true.

- C7 is ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds."" C1 is true and C6 is true, so the implication is true.

Thus C7 is True.
---
Step 1 — what C7 asks
- C7 is the statement: ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds."" We must determine whether that implication is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — use the context to evaluate the Ci
- Context: event2 happens initially. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, no other events can happen.
- From this: event1 does eventually happen. So
  - C1 (""Event1 eventually happens"") is true.
  - C2 (""Event1 eventually happens"") is true (same content as C1).

- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" C2 is true and event1 does happen, so C3 is true.

- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Since C3 is true in the given scenario, C4 is true.

- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" This is the negation of C4, so C5 is false.

- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" Negation of C5, so C6 is true.

Step 3 — evaluate C7
- C7 is ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds."" We have C1 = true and C6 = true, so the implication is true.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s asked
C7 is the claim ""C6 always holds"". We must decide whether C7 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — translate the context
Initially event2 happened (time t0). The rules force alternation:
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 at t1).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 at t2), and so on.
Thus the timeline is event2 (t0), event1 (t1), event2 (t2), event1 (t3), …

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1, C2, C4: each is ""Event1 happens in the next state"" (a state-dependent claim). At the initial state these are true (event1 at t1).
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — this would mean at every state, event1 holds in the next state. That is false (at states where event1 currently holds, the next state has event2).
- C5 = C3 or C4. Since C3 is false, C5 equals C4 (i.e. ""event1 in the next state"").
- C6 = C1 or C5. Since both C1 and C5 are just ""event1 in the next state"", C6 is equivalent to ""event1 in the next state"".

Step 4 — evaluate C7
C7 is ""C6 always holds"" i.e. ""for every state, event1 holds in the next state"". But because of the enforced alternation, there are states (those where event1 holds) whose next state has event2, so event1 does not hold in every next state. Therefore C7 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
First: what is being asked
- C7 asserts ""C6 always holds"" (i.e., in every state C6 is true). We must determine if that is true under the given context.

Examine the conditions
- Context: Initially event2 happened. Also: after event1, event2 must happen; after event2, event1 must happen. So events must alternate indefinitely: ... event2, event1, event2, event1, ...
- Hypothesis components (all phrased relative to the current state):
  - C1, C2, C4: each says ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
  - C3: ""C2 always holds"" → ""Event1 happens in the next state"" holds in every state.
  - C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds"" → either event1 is always the next event, or event1 is the next event now.
  - C6: ""C1 holds or C5 holds"" → either event1 is the next event now, or (C3 or C4) holds.
  - C7: ""C6 always holds"" → in every state, (C1 or C5) must hold.

Trace the sequence and evaluate
- From the context, states alternate: starting at initial state (where event2 just happened) the next state has event1; the following state has event2; then event1; etc.
- Consider a state where the current event is event1. In that state:
  - The next state will be event2 (by the rules), so ""Event1 happens in the next state"" is false. Thus C1 (and C2, C4) are false in that state.
  - C3 (""Event1 happens in the next state"" always) is false, because there are states (those where the current event is event1) where the next event is not event1.
  - Therefore C5 = C3 or C4 is false, and C6 = C1 or C5 is false in that state.
- Because there exists at least one state (any state where current event = event1) where C6 is false, C7 (""C6 always holds"") is false.

Final answer
False
---
Answer the question: C7 is False.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the background: initially event2 occurred. The rules force alternation: after event2 → event1 next; after event1 → event2 next. So the sequence of events by states is: state0: event2, state1: event1, state2: event2, state3: event1, ...
- C1, C2, C4 all state “event1 happens in the next state.” At state0 this is true (since event1 must follow event2). But at state1 it is false (the next state after state1 has event2).
- C3 says “C2 always holds.” That would require event1 to be true in the next state at every state; but as just noted it fails at state1. So C3 is false.
- C5 = C3 or C4. C3 is false, so C5 is equivalent to C4 (i.e., “event1 in the next state”), which holds at states that currently have event2 and fails at states that currently have event1.
- C6 = C1 or C5 reduces to “event1 happens in the next state” (since both disjuncts are that property). Thus C6 is true at states with event2 and false at states with event1.
- C7 asserts “C6 always holds.” But C6 does not hold at states where event1 currently occurs (e.g., state1), so C7 is false."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what the hypothesis asks:
C5 is ""C3 holds or C4 holds"". So we need to determine whether C3 or C4 is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context:
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 is true.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" That means once event2 has occurred, no further events (including event1) can occur later.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That means if event1 occurs at some time, no events can occur after it.

Step 3 — evaluate C1 and C2:
C1 and C2 are both ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" We already have event2 happening. But given that event2 has happened initially and no other events can happen after event2, event1 cannot happen after that. There is no information that event1 happened before the initial state, so we cannot conclude event1 happens. Thus ""Event1 happens and event2 happens"" is not satisfied. So C1 is false, and C2 (same statement) is false.

Step 4 — evaluate C3 and C4:
C3 is ""C1 holds and C2 holds"" — false because C1 and C2 are false. C4 is the same — false.

Step 5 — evaluate C5:
C5 is ""C3 holds or C4 holds"" — false because both C3 and C4 are false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
- We must decide whether C5 (which is ""C3 holds or C4 holds"") is true.

Step 2 — unpack the conditions
- C1: event1 happens and event2 happens.
- C2: event1 happens and event2 happens. (same as C1)
- C3: C1 holds and C2 holds.
- C4: C1 holds and C2 holds. (same as C3)
- C5: C3 holds or C4 holds (so effectively: C3 holds).

Context:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- (Also: after event1, no other events can happen, but that is irrelevant if event1 never occurs.)

Step 3 — reason about possible events
- Because event2 happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, event1 cannot happen at any time.
- Therefore event2 is true, event1 is false.

Step 4 — evaluate the Cs
- C1 requires both event1 and event2; since event1 is false, C1 is false.
- C2 is identical to C1, so false.
- C3 requires C1 and C2; both are false, so C3 is false.
- C4 is identical to C3, so false.
- C5 is C3 or C4; false or false = false.

Final answer:
False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The hypothesis C5 is (C3 or C4). C3 and C4 are both ""C1 and C2"", and C1 and C2 each assert ""event1 happens and event2 happens"". So C5 is equivalent to ""event1 happens and event2 happens"".
- From the context: ""Initially, event2 happened."" So event2 occurs at the initial time.
- Also: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Since event2 has already happened initially, no events can happen at any later time — in particular, event1 cannot occur after event2.
- The only remaining possibilities for event1 would be before event2 or simultaneous with event2. ""Initially, event2 happened"" rules out event1 occurring before the initial event2, and the natural reading does not allow a simultaneous separate occurrence of event1 at the same initial moment.
- Therefore event1 cannot happen while event2 happens initially, so it is impossible that both event1 and event2 happen.

Thus C5 is False."

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context, event2 happened initially, so ""Event2 eventually happens"" is true.
2. C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" — True.
3. C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — False (negation of a true statement).

5. C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds"" — True (since at least one of C3/C4 is true).

7. C7: ""C2 holds and C6 holds"" — False, because C2 is false (conjunction with true C6 is false).

Therefore C7 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify what is asked
- C7 is ""C2 holds and C6 holds"". We must decide if that conjunction is true given the context.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition using the context
- Context: initially event2 happened. After event2, event1 must happen. After event1, no other events can happen.
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True (it already happened initially).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" False (because C1 is true).
- C3: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True (same as C1).
- C4: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True (same).
- C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" True (both hold).
- C6: ""If event2 happens, then C5 holds."" True (event2 does happen and C5 is true, so the implication holds).

Step 3 — combine for C7
- C7 = C2 and C6 = False and True = False.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context the system alternates: since initially event2 happened (state 0), the next state (state 1) must have event1, then state 2 must have event2, state 3 event1, etc. So event2 holds exactly at even-numbered states and does not hold at odd-numbered states.

2. Evaluate the conditions at an arbitrary state n:
   - C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" → C1_n = not(event2 at n). So C1_n is false for even n and true for odd n.
   - C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" → C2_n = C1_{n+1} = not(event2 at n+1). So C2_n is true for even n and false for odd n (it alternates).
   - C3: ""C2 always holds"" → C3_n = for all m ≥ n, C2_m. Because C2 alternates true/false, there is always a future state where C2 is false, so C3_n is false for every n.
   - C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" → C4_n = C3_{n+1} = false (since C3 is false everywhere).
   - C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" → C5_n = C4_{n+1} = false.
   - C6: ""C5 always holds"" → C6_n = for all m ≥ n, C5_m = false (since C5 is false everywhere).
   - C7: ""C6 eventually holds"" → C7_n = there exists m ≥ n with C6_m true. Since C6 is false everywhere, C7_n is false.

Thus C7 is False.
---
Identify the question
- The hypothesis asks whether C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is true given the initial facts and the rules.

Understand the system
- Initial state (time t0): event2 happened.
- Rules: after event2, event1 must happen; after event1, event2 must happen.
- Therefore the system alternates forever: t0: event2, t1: event1, t2: event2, t3: event1, … (event2 occurs at every even time).

Examine the conditions step by step
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" At t0 this is false (event2 happened).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" At t0 this is true because at t1 event1 happens (so event2 does not happen at t1).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" This requires C2 to be true at every time. But at t1, C2 means ""at t2 event2 does not happen"", which is false (t2 has event2). So C2 is not true at t1, hence C3 is false at t0 (and fails generally).
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" Since C3 is already false at t1, C4 is false at t0.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" False for the same reason (C4 fails at t1).
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" This requires C5 to be true at every time; but C5 is already false at t1, so C6 is false at every time.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" Since C6 is false at every time, there is no future time at which C6 becomes true.

Conclusion
- C7 is False.

First, the hypothesis asks whether C7 holds at the initial state.

Interpretation and timeline
- From the context: initially event1 occurs (call that state s0).
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" and ""After event2, event1 must happen"" force an alternation:
  s0: event1, s1: event2, s2: event1, s3: event2, ... (event1 at even indices, event2 at odd indices).

Evaluate the Ci at a general state s_k (k = 0 for the initial state)
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" C1 is true at s_k iff event1 holds at s_{k+1}. Since event1 holds at even indices, C1 is true iff k+1 is even ⇔ k is odd.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" C2 is true at s_k iff C1 is true at s_{k+1}. From above, C1 is true at s_{k+1} iff k+1 is odd ⇔ k is even. So C2 true ⇔ k is even.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" So C3 true ⇔ C2 false ⇔ k is odd.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" For C4 to be true at s_k, C3 would have to hold at every s_m for m ≥ k. But C3 alternates (true at odd indices, false at even), so C3 does not hold at every future state. Therefore C4 is false at every state.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is false everywhere, C5 is true at every state.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" C5 is true at every state, so C6 is true at every state.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" But C6 is true at every state, so C7 is false at every state (including the initial state).

Conclusion
C7 is False."

Sample responses:
First identify the evaluation point: we evaluate the conditions starting from the initial state (time 0) where event1 happened and event2 did not.

1) C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p), so C1 is true in every state.

2) C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Since C1 is true in every state, C2 is true in the current state (because in the next state C1 is true).

3) C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 already holds now, so C3 is true.

4) C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is true, C4 is false.

5) C5: ""Event2 happens and C4 holds."" At the initial state event2 does not happen (event1 does), and C4 is false, so C5 is false.

6) C6: same as C1, a tautology, so C6 is true.

7) C7: ""C5 holds and C6 holds."" This is false AND true, hence false.

Final answer:
False
---
Reasoning step-by-step:

- From the context: starting with event1, the system alternates: event2 must happen next, then event1, then event2, ... So event2 does occur (in fact infinitely often).

- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (always true).

- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Since C1 is always true, it certainly holds in the next state. So C2 is true.

- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 already holds (at the current state, because C1 holds in the next state), so C3 is true.

- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This is the negation of C3, so C4 is false.

- C5: ""Event2 happens and C4 holds."" C4 is false, so C5 is false regardless of event2.

- C6: same as C1, a tautology, so true.

- C7: ""C5 holds and C6 holds."" Since C5 is false, the conjunction is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C7 (C5 holds and C6 holds) is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is a tautology (always true) in any state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Since C1 is true in every state, C2 is true in every state (the next state too).
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Because C2 already holds (indeed in every state), C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This contradicts C3, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""Event2 happens and C4 holds."" C4 is false, so C5 is false (conjunction with a false conjunct is false).
- C6: same as C1, a tautology, so C6 is true.
- C7: ""C5 holds and C6 holds."" C5 is false, C6 is true, so the conjunction C7 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
We must decide whether C6 (""C5 does not hold"") is true or false given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (Whether this is true depends on the event constraints.)
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens.""
- C3: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" (C3 is syntactically identical to C2.)
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" Since C2 and C3 are the same formula, C4 is an instance of P → P, which is always true.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" Because C4 is a tautological implication (P → P), it indeed always holds, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" This asserts the negation of C5.

Step 3 — use the context (consistency check)
The context (initially event1 happened; after event1 no other events can happen; after event2 event1 must happen) does not affect the logical truth that C4 is a tautology. Therefore C5 is true in any case, so C6 (the negation of C5) is false.

Final answer
False

We are asked whether C6 (""C5 does not hold"") is true.

Step-by-step:
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens.""
- C3: ""C1 holds and event1 happens.""

So C2 and C3 are the same formula.

- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" Since C2 and C3 are identical, C4 is a tautology (p → p), hence true in every state.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" Because C4 is true in every state, C5 is true.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" This contradicts the conclusion that C5 holds, so C6 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
We are asked whether C6 (""C5 does not hold"") is True or False.

Step 1 — identify the goal
- We must determine the truth of C6 given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — understand each condition
- Context:
  - Initially event1 happened.
  - After event2, event1 must happen.
  - After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 occurs, no events occur afterward, including event1 itself).
- C1: event1 happens in the next state.
- C2: C1 holds and event1 happens (so event1 now and again in the next state).
- C3: same as C2 (C1 holds and event1 happens).
- C4: if C2 holds then C3 holds. Because C2 and C3 are identical, C4 is a tautology (A → A).
- C5: C4 always holds (i.e., the tautology holds in all states).
- C6: C5 does not hold (negation of C5).

Step 3 — reason about the timeline
- From the context, initially event1 happened; after event1 no other events can happen, so there is no subsequent event1 in the next state. Thus C1 is false in the initial state, and consequently C2 and C3 are false there.
- Regardless of the truth of C2/C3 in any state, C4 is a tautological implication (C2 → C3) and therefore true in every state. So C5 (that C4 always holds) is true.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C5 is true, so ""C5 does not hold"" (C6) is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked
- We must decide whether C7 is true or false given the context and the chain of conditions.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2 (and also after event1) no other events can happen. So once the initial state is reached (where event2 has happened), no further events ever occur.
- Therefore event1 never occurs in any state (it did not occur initially, and nothing can occur afterwards).

Step 3 — examine the conditions and propagate truth values
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Since event1 never occurs in any state, C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — C1 is false in every state, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — C2 never holds, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" — false for the same reason.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" — false.
- C6: ""C5 always holds"" — C5 is false, so C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state"" — C6 is false, so C7 is false.

Final answer
False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The system starts with event2, and after event2 no further events can occur. So there is no state where event1 ever happens.
- C1 (""event1 always happens"") is false.
- C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false (there is no next state after the initial state, and C1 is false anyway).
- C3, C4, C5 (nested ""eventually"" of a false statement) are all false.
- C6 (""C5 always holds"") is false because C5 is false.
- C7 (""C6 holds in the next state"") is therefore false.

So C7 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event2 happened. The conditions also say that after event2 (and after event1) no other events can happen, so the initial state is terminal — there is no next state and no future events.
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" That is false in the initial (and only) state because event1 did not happen (event2 did). So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" There is no next state (terminal), so ""next C1"" is false.
- C3–C5: Each is of the form ""eventually holds"" of the previous false condition. With no future states, none of these eventualities can become true, so C3, C4, C5 are all false.
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" Since C5 is false now, C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" There is no next state, and C6 is false now, so C7 is false.

Therefore C7 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Context gives an alternating sequence starting with event2: state0: event2; state1: event1; state2: event2; state3: event1; ….

- C1: ""event2 or event2"" ≡ event2. True at state0 (and at states 2,4,…).

- C2 / C5: ""C1 holds in the next state"" ≡ ""event2 holds in the next state."" At state0 the next state (state1) has event1, so C2/C5 are false at state0.

- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" From state0, at state1 we have event1 and at state1 the next state (state2) has event2, so C2 is true at state1. Therefore C2 holds at some future state, so C3 is true at state0.

- C4: ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds."" At every state where event2 holds (states 0,2,4,…), the pattern ensures some future state where C2 holds (for example the immediate next state if that state is event1). Thus C4 is true.

- C6: ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds"" i.e. C4 → C5. At state0 C4 is true but C5 is false, so the implication is false.

Therefore C6 is False.

Final answer by majority vote: True

Sample responses:
We want to know whether C5 (""C3 holds and C4 holds"") is true given the context.

Interpretation (standard temporal reading):
- ""Event2 eventually happens"" (C1) means: at some future time in the run, event2 occurs.
- ""C1 always holds"" (C2) means: at every point in the run, C1 is true (i.e., from every point onward, event2 will eventually occur).

Given the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen (irrelevant here because event1 never occurs).

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Because event2 happens initially, C1 is true (event2 does occur).
2. Consider C2: at a time after the initial event2, there are no future occurrences of event2 (no further events at all). So from that later timepoint, ""event2 eventually happens"" is false. Therefore C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false.
3. C3 is ""C2 does not hold"" — since C2 is false, C3 is true. C4 is the same as C3, so C4 is also true.
4. C5 is ""C3 holds and C4 holds"" — since both C3 and C4 are true, C5 is true.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
You must decide whether C5 (which states “C3 holds and C4 holds”) is true or false given the scenario.

Step 2 — understand the scenario
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen. (So the trace is: event2 occurs, then nothing else.)
- Also: after event1, no other events can happen. (Irrelevant here because event1 never occurs in the actual trace.)

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: “Event2 eventually happens.” True — event2 already happened initially.
- C2: “C1 always holds.” Interpreting “always” in the usual temporal sense (for every point in time), C1 fails at times after event2: once we are after the initial moment, event2 will not happen in the future (it already happened), so “event2 eventually happens” is false at those later times. Therefore C2 is false.
- C3: “C2 does not hold.” Since C2 is false, C3 is true.
- C4: “C2 does not hold.” Same as C3, so C4 is also true.

Step 4 — evaluate C5
- C5 = “C3 holds and C4 holds.” Both C3 and C4 are true, so C5 is true.

Final answer: True
---
First identify what's asked: C5 = (C3 holds) AND (C4 holds). So we need to evaluate C3 and C4.

Examine each condition with the context:
- Context: Initially event2 happened. After event2 no other events can happen (and after event1 no other events can happen). So the only possible execution is: event2 occurs initially, then nothing else.
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True — it happens initially.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" True — in the only possible execution C1 is true, so C1 holds in every reachable situation (there is no trace where event2 fails to occur).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" False, because C2 does hold.
- C4: ""C2 does not hold."" False, same reason.

Therefore C5 = C3 AND C4 = False AND False = False.

Final answer: False"

Answer: False

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. From the context:
   - Initially event1 happens.
   - After event1, event2 must happen → event2 will occur sometime after the initial moment.
   - After event2, no further events can occur.
   So both event1 and event2 occur (event1 at the start, event2 later).

2. Evaluate the Ci’s:
   - C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" True (both happen).
   - C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" True (C1 already holds initially).
   - C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" True (event2 happens and C2 holds).
   - C4: ""C3 does not hold."" False (C3 holds).
   - C5: ""C4 always holds."" False (C4 is false, so it does not hold always).
   - C6: ""C5 does not hold."" True (since C5 is false).
   - C7: ""C6 does not hold."" False (C6 is true, so C7 is false).

Thus C7 is False.
---
You ask whether C7 (""C6 does not hold"") is True or False. Evaluate the conditions step by step given the context.

Context facts:
- Initially event1 happened (so event1 is true now).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur eventually).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Evaluate the conditions:
1. C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" True now because event1 happened initially.
2. C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" True (C1 already holds now, so it holds eventually).
3. C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" True because C2 holds.
4. C4: ""C3 does not hold."" False, since C3 holds.
5. C5: ""C4 always holds."" False, because C4 is already false now (so it cannot hold always).
6. C6: ""C5 does not hold."" True, because C5 is false.
7. C7: ""C6 does not hold."" False, because C6 is true.

Final answer:
False
---
The hypothesis asks whether the proposition C7 (""C6 does not hold"") is true given the context and the chain of conditions C1–C7.

Evaluate step by step at the initial moment (context: event1 has happened; after event1, event2 must happen; after event2 nothing else can happen):

- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" True (event1 already happened initially).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" True (C1 already holds now, so it holds eventually).
- C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" True (C2 holds).
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" False (C3 holds).
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" False (C4 is false now, so it is not always true).
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" True (C5 is false).

- We must decide whether C5 (C3 holds or C4 holds) is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has happened, no future state can have any event occur.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Irrelevant here because event2 never happens.)

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This is false in the initial state because event1 did happen initially.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" In the state immediately after the initial one, no events can happen (because event1 already happened), so in that next state event1 does not happen — C1 is true there. Thus C2 is true (at the initial state).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" From any state on the trace, the next state will never feature event1 (since event1 happened only initially and no further events can occur), so C2 holds at every state. Therefore C3 is true.
- C4: ""C2 always holds."" This is the same statement as C3, so C4 is also true.
- C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" Since both C3 and C4 are true, their disjunction C5 is true.

Final answer
True
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. What’s given: initially event1 happened (so event1 is true in the initial state). After event1 no other events can happen, so the initial state is terminal (it has no successor). The statement about event2 is irrelevant because event2 never actually occurs.

2. Evaluate C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This is false, because event1 does happen initially.

3. Evaluate C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" There is no next state (the initial state is terminal). Under the standard semantics for a next operator on terminal states, X φ (φ holds in the next state) is false when there is no successor. So C2 is false.

4. Evaluate C3 and C4: Both assert ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is false in the initial state, C3 and C4 are both false.

5. Evaluate C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" Both disjuncts are false, so C5 is false.

Therefore C5 is False.
---
False

Reasoning step-by-step:
- The context states ""Initially, event1 happened."" so C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is false at the initial state.
- C2 says ""C1 holds in the next state."" Even if there were a next state, C1 is already false now, and the context also says ""After event1, no other events can happen"" (so there may be no next state at all). In any case C2 cannot be guaranteed true.
- C3 and C4 both assert that C2 always holds; since C2 is not true now (and cannot be guaranteed), both C3 and C4 are false.

Context summary: initially event2 happens, and after event2 no other events can happen (so event2 occurs and then the system is stuck; event1 never occurs).

Evaluate the conditions:

- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is just ""event2 happens"", which is true (it happens initially). So C1 = True.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Negation of C1, so C2 = False.
- C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" Since event2 does happen initially, C3 is True at that time. At later times, if one interprets ""event2 happens"" as not reoccurring, C2 becomes true there (because C1 would be false at those later instants), so C3 remains true at all times. Either way C3 = True (it holds at every moment).
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" From the previous line, C3 holds at all times, so C4 = True.
- C5: ""Event1 happens and C4 holds."" C4 is True but event1 never happens (event2 prevents any later events), so C5 = False.
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" Since C5 is false, C6 = False.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" C6 never becomes true, so C7 = False.

Therefore C7 is False.
---
We are asked whether C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is True or False.

Given the context:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Step-by-step evaluation:
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — this is just ""event2 happens"". Since event2 happened initially, C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — false, because C1 is true.
- C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds"" — since event2 happened, C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — C3 depends on the fact that event2 happened (and C2 is false). The occurrence of event2 is given and no further events occur, so C3 holds throughout; C4 is true.
- C5: ""Event1 happens and C4 holds"" — event1 never happens (only event2 happened), so C5 is false (even though C4 is true).
- C6: ""C5 always holds"" — C5 is false and cannot become true later (no further events possible), so C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds"" — since C6 is false now and will remain false, C7 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify goal
We must decide whether C7 is True or False.

Step 2 — use the context
From the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
Thus event1 happens as well. So both event1 and event2 occur.

Step 3 — evaluate conditions
- C1: event2 and event1 — True.
- C2: event2 and event1 — True.
- C3: If C2 holds, then event1 — C2 is True and event1 is True, so C3 is True.
- C4: C1 or C3 — at least C1 is True, so C4 is True.
- C5: C4 does not hold — since C4 is True, C5 is False.
- C6: event2 and event1 — True.
- C7: C5 or C6 — C5 is False but C6 is True, so C7 is True.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — identify what’s asked
We must determine the truth of C7 given the context and the listed conditions.

Step 2 — use the context
Context: initially event2 happened. After event2, event1 must happen; and after event1, event2 must happen. From the initial event2, event1 must occur, and then event2 occurs again, etc. Therefore both event2 and event1 do happen. So the atomic fact ""event2 happens and event1 happens"" is true.

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" True (from context).
- C2: same as C1. True.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" C2 is true and event1 happens, so the implication is true.
- C4: ""C1 holds or C3 holds."" At least one (in fact both) of C1 and C3 is true, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is true, C5 is false.
- C6: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" True (same as C1/C2).
- C7: ""C5 holds or C6 holds."" C5 is false but C6 is true, so the disjunction is true.

Final answer
True
---
Goal: decide truth of C7 (C5 or C6) given the context and the listed conditions.

1) From context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen. Therefore event1 happens (because event2 did).
- So both event2 and event1 happen.

2) Evaluate each condition:
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" True (from step 1).
- C2: same as C1. True.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" Antecedent C2 is true and event1 is true, so the implication is true. Thus C3 is true.
- C4: ""C1 holds or C3 holds."" C1 is true, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is true, C5 is false.
- C6: same as C1/C2. True.

3) Finally C7 = C5 or C6 = false or true = true.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true in the given scenario.

Step 2 — model the scenario (timeline semantics)
- Time points t0, t1, t2, ... (standard linear-time semantics, ""next"" means the immediately following time, ""eventually"" means at some time ≥ current).
- At t0: event1 happened (so proposition event1 is true at t0).
- For all t > t0: no events happen, so event1 and event2 are false at all t ≥ t1.
- The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never occurs in this model.

Step 3 — evaluate each condition at t0 and subsequent times
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" At t0 this is false (event1 happens at t0). At all t ≥ t1 it is true (event1 does not happen there).
- C2: same as C1, so false at t0, true at all t ≥ t1.
- C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" At t0: event2 is false and C2 is false, so C3 is false at t0. At any t ≥ t1: event2 is false but C2 is true, so C3 is true for t ≥ t1.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" At t0 this asks whether C3 holds at t1; since C3 is true at t1, C4 is true at t0. For t ≥ t1, C4 refers to t+1 ≥ t2 where C3 is true as well, so C4 is true at all t ≥ t0 (actually true at every time because from t1 onward C3 holds).
- C5: ""C1 holds or C4 holds."" At t0: C1 is false but C4 is true, so C5 is true at t0. At any t ≥ t1: C1 is true, so C5 is true there too. Thus C5 holds at every time.
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" Since C5 already holds at the current time at every time point, C6 is true at every time.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" Because C6 is true at t0 and at every future time, C7 is true at t0.

True

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. The question asks whether C7 (""C6 does not hold"") is true or false.

2. From the hypothesis:
   - C5 is ""Event1 does not happen"" (¬E1).
   - C4 is ""C3 holds or event1 happens"" (C3 ∨ E1).
   - C6 is ""C4 holds or C5 holds"", i.e. (C3 ∨ E1) ∨ ¬E1.

3. Note that (E1 ∨ ¬E1) is a tautology, so (C3 ∨ E1) ∨ ¬E1 is always true regardless of C3. Therefore C6 is true in every case.

4. C7 states ""C6 does not hold"" (¬C6). Since C6 is always true, ¬C6 is false.

Thus C7 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context: event2 happened initially, and ""after event2, event1 must happen."" Therefore event1 does happen.
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" — False.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" — Since event2 does happen but C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" — C2 is false, so the implication C3 is vacuously true.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" — True (both C3 and event1 are true).
- C5: ""Event1 does not happen."" — same as C1, False.
- C6: ""C4 holds or C5 holds."" — True ∨ False = True.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" — Since C6 is true, C7 is False.

Therefore C7 is False.
---
Step 1 — from the context:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
Thus event1 does happen (event2 → event1, and event2 occurs).

Step 2 — evaluate each condition:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" False (we have event1).
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Antecedent true (event2 happened) but consequent false (C1 false), so C2 is false.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" C2 is false, so the implication is true (a false antecedent makes the conditional true).
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" C3 is true (and event1 also holds), so C4 is true.
- C5: ""Event1 does not happen."" Same as C1, false.
- C6: ""C4 holds or C5 holds."" C4 is true, so C6 is true.

Step 3 — C7: ""C6 does not hold."" Since C6 is true, C7 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s asked
- We must decide whether C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — use the context

- After event1, no other events can happen, so event2 can never occur at any future point.
- (The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never occurs.)

- C1: event1 eventually happens. True (holds initially).
- C2: event1 eventually happens. True (same as C1).
- C3: If C2 holds, then event2 happens. Since C2 is true, C3 asserts event2 happens. But event2 cannot happen, so C3 is False.
- C4: C1 holds and C3 holds. That is True and False → False.
- C5: C4 holds in the next state. C4 is always False (because C3 is false and nothing can make event2 happen), so C5 is False.

- C7: C6 eventually holds. Since C6 never holds, C7 is False.

Final answer:
False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step by step):

- Context: initially event1 has happened. After event1 no other events can occur. If event2 ever occurs then event1 must occur after it. Practically, given the initial event1, no further events (including event2) can happen at any future point.

- C1 and C2: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True — event1 already happened initially.

- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" Since C2 is true, C3 asserts that event2 happens. But event2 cannot happen (no events occur after the initial event1). So C3 is false.

- C4: C1 and C3 — false (true AND false = false).

- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" C4 is false now and remains false in all futures (because event2 never occurs), so C5 is false.

- C6: ""Event2 happens or C5 holds."" Both disjuncts are false, so C6 is false at all times.

- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" Since C6 never holds, C7 is false.

Therefore C7 is False.
---
Reasoning:

- Context gives: event1 holds in the initial state, and after event1 no other events can occur. So event2 never happens in this trace.
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True (it holds initially).
- C2: same as C1, so True.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" Since C2 is true, C3 requires event2 to happen. But event2 does not happen, so C3 is False.
- C4: ""C1 holds and C3 holds."" C1 is True but C3 is False, so C4 is False.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" C4 is false and nothing can make it true later, so C5 is False.

- C6 (""C5 always holds"") is false because C5 is already false now (so it does not hold at all times).

- C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is false since C6 is never true at any time.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what’s asked
- We must decide whether C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is true or false under the given context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 has already occurred.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" says: if event1 ever occurs, then event2 must occur afterwards.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" says: once event2 has occurred, no further events can occur after that point.

Because event2 has already happened initially, no other events can occur at any later time — in particular, event1 never occurs (it did not happen before initial event2, and cannot happen after).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" True (event2 has happened).
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" False, because event1 never happens.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" False (C2 is false and event1 does not happen).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" False (C3 is false and cannot become true later).
- C5: ""C4 holds and event1 happens."" False.
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" False (C5 is false now).
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" False (C6 is false and cannot become true).

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 has happened, so ""event2 happens"" is true at the start.
- Rule: after event2, no other events can happen. Since event2 has already happened initially, event1 cannot occur at any time thereafter.
- The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant because event1 never occurs.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — true (event2 did happen).
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds"" — false, because event1 never happens.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens"" — false (requires event1).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" — false (C3 never becomes true).

Examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens.""
- C2: ""Event1 eventually happens."" (same as C1)
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Since C1 and C2 are identical, C3 is a tautology and therefore true.
- C4: ""Event1 eventually happens."" (same content as C1/C2)
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" This says: at every point in time it is true that event1 will eventually happen.
- C6: ""C3 holds and C5 holds."" So C6 is true exactly when both C3 and C5 are true.

Trace the event sequence given the context
- Initially event2 occurred.
- Rules: after event2, event1 must happen; after event1, event2 must happen.
- Starting from the initial event2, event1 will occur next, then event2, then event1, etc. Event1 occurs repeatedly (infinitely often).
- Therefore ""event1 eventually happens"" is true now and remains true at every future point (because event1 recurs). Thus C1/C2/C4 are true, and C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true.

Combine results
- C3 is true (tautology).
- C5 is true (from the alternating sequence).
- Therefore C6 (C3 and C5) is true.

Conclusion about C7
- C7 claims C6 does not hold, but we found C6 does hold. Hence C7 is False.

Final answer:
False
---
You are asking whether C7 (""C6 does not hold"") is true or false given the context and the listed conditions.

Step-by-step reasoning:

- Context: Initially event2 happens. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, event1 must happen. Thus starting from the initial event2, the system forces event1 to happen next, then event2, then event1, etc., producing an infinite alternation where event1 occurs infinitely often.

- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True (follows from the initial event2 and the rule after event2).

- C2: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Same as C1, so True.

- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Since C1 and C2 are both true, the implication is True.

- C4: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Again True.

- C5: ""C4 always holds."" Interpreting ""always"" as ""at every point in time along the run, C4 is true"": because event1 occurs infinitely often, from any point there is some future event1, so C4 holds at every time. Thus C5 is True.

- C6: ""C3 holds and C5 holds."" Both are True, so C6 is True.

- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" This is the negation of C6; since C6 is True, C7 is False.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
- We must decide whether C7 (""C6 does not hold"") is True or False.

Step 2 — use the context
- Initially event2 occurred.
- Rules: after event2, event1 must happen; after event1, event2 must happen.
- Therefore event1 will occur (at least once) and the two events force each other repeatedly, so event1 occurs infinitely often. In particular, at every point there is some future time with event1.

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" — True.
- C2: same as C1 — True.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" — True (it's tautologically true here).
- C4: ""Event1 eventually happens."" — True.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" Meaning at every timepoint event1 still will occur in the future — True, because events alternate forever.
- C6: ""C3 holds and C5 holds."" — True (both conjuncts true).
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" — False (since C6 does hold).

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C7 is True or False given the context (initial event2, then event1 must occur, then no further events).

Step 1 — interpret the timeline
- s0 (initial): event2 happened.
- s1: event1 happens (must follow event2).
- No further states after s1 (after event1 no other events can happen).

Step 2 — evaluate the Ci in each relevant state
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautological implication; it holds in every state (true in s0 and s1).
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is true in every state.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 does hold, C3 is false in every state.
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" C1 holds but C3 is false, so C4 is false in every state.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" At s0 the next state is s1 and C4 is false there, so C5 is false at s0. At s1 there is no next state, so C5 is false there as well (next-state formulas fail when no next state exists).
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" Because C5 is false already at s0 (and s1), C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" C6 is false in every state, so there is no state where C6 holds; therefore C7 is false.

Final answer:
False
---

---
False

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautological implication (A → A), so C1 is true.

2. C2: Same statement as C1, so C2 is also true.

3. C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 does hold (true), C3 is false.

4. C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" C1 does hold, but C3 is false, so the implication C4 is false.

5. C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" C4 is false now and, because C1/C2/C3 are simple logical facts that do not change over time here, C4 will also be false in the next state. So C5 is false.

6. C6: ""C5 always holds."" Because C5 is false (now and in future), C6 is false.

7. C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" Since C6 is false and will not become true, C7 is false.

Therefore C7 is False."

Sample responses:
We want to know whether C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is true given the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen (irrelevant because event2 never occurs).

Reasoning step by step:

1. Timeline: at the initial state s0 event1 occurs; because ""after event1 no other events can happen"", there is a next state s1 with no events occurring (and no further events thereafter).

2. Evaluate the conditions at s0 and s1:
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" At s0 this is false (event1 happened). At s1 this is true (no events happen there).
- C2: same as C1, so false at s0, true at s1.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" At s0, the next state is s1 and C2 is true at s1, so C3 is true at s0.
- C4: ""If event1 happens, then C3 holds."" At s0 event1 happens and C3 is true, so C4 is true at s0. At s1 the antecedent is false, so C4 is true there as well (vacuously).
- C5: ""C1 holds and C4 holds."" At s0 C1 is false and C4 true, so C5 is false at s0. At s1 both conjuncts are true, so C5 is true at s1.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" At s0 the next state is s1 and C5 is true at s1, so C6 is true at s0.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" Since C6 already holds at s0, C7 is true.

Answer: False

Reasoning, step by step:

- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Since event1 already happened initially, the implication is true (the consequent is true), so C1 holds.
- C2 = not C1, so C2 is False.
- C3 = not C2, so C3 is True (in fact C3 is equivalent to C1).
- C4 = C3 holds or event1 happens. C3 is True (and event1 also happened), so C4 is True.
- C5 = ""C4 eventually holds."" C4 already holds now (and is stable), so C5 is True.
- C6 = ""C5 eventually holds."" Same reasoning: C5 already holds, so C6 is True.
- C7 = not C6, so C7 is False.

Therefore C7 is False.
---
Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context: event1 happened initially, and after event1 no other events can happen. So event1 is true (now) and event2 does not occur later.

2. C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Since event2 never happens, the implication is vacuously true. Therefore C1 holds.

3. C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Because C1 holds, C2 is false.

4. C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false, C3 is true.

5. C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" Both disjuncts are true (C3 is true and event1 happened), so C4 is true.

6. C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" C4 already holds now, so C5 is true.

7. C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" C5 holds now, so C6 is true.

8. C7: ""C6 does not hold."" Since C6 is true, C7 is false.

Thus C7 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Context: event1 happened initially. After event1 (and after event2) no other events can happen — so event2 cannot occur after the initial event1, and in the actual run event2 does not occur.

2. C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Given the context, there is no situation where event2 occurs without event1 (event1 already happened and event2 cannot happen afterwards), so the implication is true. Thus C1 holds.

3. C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 holds, C2 is false.

4. C3: ""C2 does not hold."" C2 is false, so C3 is true.

5. C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" Both disjuncts are true (C3 holds, and event1 happened), so C4 holds.

6. C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" C4 already holds now, so the eventuality is satisfied; C5 holds.

7. C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" C5 already holds, so C6 holds.

8. C7: ""C6 does not hold."" C6 holds, so C7 is false.

Therefore C7 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
First: the hypothesis asks whether C7 is true.

Interpret the context:
- Initially event1 has happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. Therefore no event (including event2) can occur at any later time.
- The clause ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is moot because event2 can never occur (event1 already happened initially and prevents any later events).

Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" — False (event2 cannot happen).
- C2: same as C1 — False.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" — This is an implication with identical consequent and antecedent; with C1 false, the implication is true (false => false is true).
- C4: ""Event2 eventually happens."" — False.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" — Means at every (current and future) state C4 is true; since C4 is false initially, C5 is false.
- C6: ""C3 holds and C5 holds."" — C3 is true but C5 is false, so C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" — C6 is false now and remains false, so C7 is false (and there is no event producing a state where C6 becomes true).

Therefore C7 is False. Final answer:
False
---
First, what is being asked: we must decide whether C7 (""C6 holds in the next state"") is True or False, given the context and the definitions of the Ci.

Examine the context (timeline constraints)
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
Because event1 has already happened initially and no events can happen after event1, event2 can never occur at any point in the future.

Evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" — False (event2 never happens).
- C2: same as C1 — False.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" — This is an implication P→P, which is true regardless of P's truth value. So C3 is True.
- C4: ""Event2 eventually happens."" — False (same as C1).
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" — False, since C4 is false.
- C6: ""C3 holds and C5 holds."" — C3 is True but C5 is False, so C6 is False.

Now C7: ""C6 holds in the next state.""
- Because no events can happen after the initial state, moving to the next state does not enable event2; the truth values of the Ci that depend on event2 remain the same (C4, C5, hence C6 remain false). Thus C6 is false in the next state as well.
- Therefore C7 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen → starting from the initial state, event2 can never happen.
- (The rule ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never occurs.)

Step 2 — evaluate conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" False (event2 never happens).
- C2: same as C1. False.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Antecedent C1 is false, so the implication is vacuously true. True.
- C4: ""Event2 eventually happens."" False (same as C1).
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" Since C4 is false, C5 is false.
- C6: ""C3 holds and C5 holds."" True and False → False.
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" C6 is false (and remains false), so C7 is false.

Goal: decide whether C7 holds.

1) Context summary:
- At the initial state event2 has happened.
- After event2 no other events can happen. (So there are no future occurrences of event1 or any other event.)
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant because event1 never occurs (no events can happen after the initial event2).

2) Evaluate conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Given no events can occur after the initial event2, event1 cannot eventually happen. So C1 is false.
- C2: same as C1, so false.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" C2 is false, event2 does happen initially, but the conjunction is false → C3 false.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" C3 is false in all states, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" False.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" False.
- C7: ""C1 holds and C6 holds."" Both conjuncts are false, so C7 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
C7 = C1 ∧ C6. So we must decide whether both C1 and C6 hold under the given context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially, event2 happened (so at the initial state event2 is true).
- After event2, no other events can happen. Thus once event2 has occurred (here, initially), no event can occur at any later state — in particular event1 cannot occur at any future time.
- The rule “After event1, event2 must happen” is irrelevant because event1 can never occur after the initial event2.

Step 3 — evaluate the Cs
- C1 (event1 eventually happens): False. Because event2 already happened initially and no further events can happen, so event1 cannot ever occur.
- C2 is the same as C1, so False.
- C3 = (C2 holds) ∧ (event2 happens). C2 is false, so C3 is False.
- C4 (C3 holds in the next state): False (C3 is false at every state).
- C5 (C4 always holds): False.
- C6 (C5 holds in the next state): False.

Step 4 — conclude C7
C7 = C1 ∧ C6 = False ∧ False = False.

Sample responses:
True

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Let p = ""event2 happens"", q = ""event1 happens"".
- From context: q is true initially, and after that no events occur (so for all future states p and q are false). Also p never occurs (there is no time it happens).
- C1 = p (since ""event2 happens or event2 happens"" is just p) → false at the initial state.
- C2 = always C1 = G p → false (p is false).
- C3 = q or C2 = q or G p → true at the initial state because q is true initially.
- C4 = p or C3 → true at the initial state (C3 true).
- C5 = eventually C4 = F C4 → true at the initial state (C4 holds now).
- C6 = not C5 → false at the initial state.
- Look at the next state: after the initial event1, no events occur, so p and q are false forever. Thus at the next state C4 is false forever, so C5 is false there, hence C6 is true in the next state.
- C7 = ""C6 holds in the next state"" = true.

Therefore C7 is True.
---
Step 1 — interpret the context and modalities
- Initially (at the current/initial state) event1 happened.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means in every state after the initial one no events occur (in particular event2 never occurs after the initial state).
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 never occurs anywhere in this trace (event1 already happened initially and blocks further events).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions at the initial state
- C1 = ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" ≡ Event2 happens. At the initial state this is false (only event1 happened).
- C2 = ""C1 always holds"" (globally C1). Since C1 is false at the initial state, C2 is false.
- C3 = ""Event1 happens or C2 holds"". At the initial state event1 did happen, so C3 is true.
- C4 = ""Event2 happens or C3 holds"". At the initial state C3 is true, so C4 is true.
- C5 = ""C4 eventually holds"". Since C4 already holds at the initial state, C5 is true.
- C6 = ""C5 does not hold"" = ¬C5. Therefore C6 is false at the initial state.

Step 3 — evaluate the next state
- In the next state (all events blocked after event1): event1 does not happen (it happened only initially) and event2 does not happen anywhere.
- C2 remains false (C1 is not true everywhere).
- C3 = ""event1 happens or C2"" is false in the next state.
- C4 = ""event2 happens or C3"" is false in the next state.
- C5 = ""C4 eventually holds"" is false from the next state onward (C4 never becomes true after the initial state).
- C6 = ""C5 does not hold"" is true in the next state.

C7 is ""C6 holds in the next state"" (X C6). We found C6 is true in the next state, so C7 is true.

True

We are asked whether C7 is True or False.

Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen. => event2 happens.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Therefore both event1 and event2 happen, and the sequence ends.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition:
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" True (both events occur).
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" True (event2 happens).
- C3: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" True (same as C1).
- C4: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" True (same as C1/C3).
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" True (C3 is true and C4 is true, so the implication is true).
- C6: ""Event2 happens and C5 holds."" True (event2 true and C5 true).
- C7: ""C2 holds or C6 holds."" True (both disjuncts are true).

Final answer: True
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must determine the truth of C7 given the context and definitions of C1–C6.

Step 2 — use the context to determine which events occur
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → event2 happens.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- Therefore the actual events that happen are exactly: event1 and event2.

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" True (both occur).
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" True (event2 happens).
- C3: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" True (same as C1).
- C4: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" True.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" True (C3 is true and C4 is true, so the implication is true).
- C6: ""Event2 happens and C5 holds."" True (event2 true and C5 true).
- C7: ""C2 holds or C6 holds."" True (both C2 and C6 are true, so the disjunction is true).

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide the truth of C7, which says ""C6 does not hold.""

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (A → A), so C1 is true in all states.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C1 holds and C2 holds."" Since both are true, C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Because C1 and C2 are logical tautologies, C3 holds in every state, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" If something always holds, it certainly eventually holds, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""If C5 holds, then event2 happens."" C5 is true, and from the context we know event2 happened initially, so the consequent (""event2 happens"") is true. Hence C6 is true (true antecedent and true consequent → implication true).

Step 3 — conclude about C7
- C7 says ""C6 does not hold."" Since we just established C6 holds, C7 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. Context: event2 happened initially, and after event2 no other events can occur. Therefore event1 never happens (there is no time after the initial event2 for event1 to occur, and it is not stated to have happened before).
2. C1 and C2 are tautologies (If event1 happens then event1 happens). They are true regardless of whether event1 actually occurs.
3. C3 (C1 and C2) is true. C4 (C3 always holds) is true. C5 (C4 eventually holds) is true because something that always holds in particular holds at some time.
4. C6 is the implication “If C5 holds, then event2 happens.” C5 does hold, and event2 has already happened initially, so the implication C6 is true.
5. C7 states “C6 does not hold.” Since C6 does hold, C7 is false.
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
C7 is the claim ""C6 does not hold."" The question asks whether C7 is True or False.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions

- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (A → A), so C1 holds.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 holds.
- C3: ""C1 holds and C2 holds."" Since C1 and C2 hold, C3 holds.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" C3 is true, and nothing in the context makes it time-dependent, so C3 is true at all times; therefore C4 holds.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" If something always holds, it certainly holds at some time, so C5 holds.
- C6: ""If C5 holds, then event2 happens."" We have C5 true, and the context states that event2 happened initially, so event2 does happen. Therefore the implication C5 → event2 is true, so C6 holds.

Step 3 — conclusion about C7
C7 states ""C6 does not hold."" But we just established C6 does hold, so C7 is false.

Votes: {'False': 3}
Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step by step):

- Context: initially event1 has happened. Also the rules ""After event2, event1 must happen"" and ""After event1, event2 must happen"" mean that whenever event2 occurs, event1 will eventually occur afterward, and whenever event1 occurs, event2 will eventually occur afterward. In particular, event1 does occur (already in the initial state) and these rules ensure event1 will occur again whenever event2 occurs.

- C1 and C2: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Given event1 already happened initially, ""eventually event1"" is true (and the mutual “after” rules ensure it holds at all relevant states). So C1 and C2 are true.

- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" This is exactly the ""after event2, event1 must happen"" rule restated (C2 is event1 eventually happens). So C3 is true in the model.

- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This contradicts the above: C3 is true, so C4 is false.

- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" Since C4 is false and there is no way for C3 to become false (the context enforces C3), C5 is false.

- C6: ""C1 holds and C5 holds."" C1 is true but C5 is false, so C6 is false.

- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" Since C6 is false now (and cannot be made true by the provided rules), C7 is false.

Therefore C7 is False.
---
Reasoning:

- From the context: initially event1 occurs, and whenever event1 occurs then later event2 must occur, and whenever event2 occurs then later event1 must occur. So the trace alternates (or at least repeatedly contains) event1 and event2; event1 occurs at the initial state and then again infinitely often.

- C1: “Event1 eventually happens.” True (it already happens initially and recurs).

- C2: same as C1. True.

- C3: “If event2 happens, then C2 holds.” At any state where event2 happens, event1 will later happen (by the given rule), so C2 holds; at states without event2 the implication is vacuously true. So C3 is true everywhere.

- C4: “C3 does not hold.” Since C3 holds, C4 is false (everywhere).

- C5: “C4 eventually holds.” False, because C4 is never true.

- C6: “C1 holds and C5 holds.” False (C1 true but C5 false).

- C7: “C6 holds in the next state.” In the next state C6 is still false, so C7 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must decide whether C7 (""C6 holds in the next state"") can be true given the context rules.

Step 2 — interpret the context and conditions
- Context:
  - Initially event1 happened (so F(event1) holds at the start).
  - After event2, event1 must happen: whenever event2 happens, eventually event1 happens (i.e. event2 -> F(event1)).
  - After event1, event2 must happen: whenever event1 happens, eventually event2 happens (i.e. event1 -> F(event2)).
- Conditions:
  - C1: F(event1) (event1 eventually happens).
  - C2: F(event1) (same as C1).
  - C3: (event2 -> C2) i.e. event2 -> F(event1).
  - C4: ¬C3 (C3 does not hold).
  - C5: F(C4) (eventually C4 holds).
  - C6: C1 ∧ C5.
  - C7: X(C6) (C6 holds in the next state).

Step 3 — evaluate consistency with the context
- From the context, C3 (event2 -> F(event1)) is guaranteed by the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" and thus is true in all states.
- Therefore C4 (¬C3) is false in every state.
- Since C4 never holds, C5 (F(C4)) is false.
- Then C6 = C1 ∧ C5 is false (even though C1 is true, C5 is false).
- Hence C7 = X(C6) is false (next state cannot make C6 true because C5 is never true).

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
What is being asked
- Decide whether C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true or false given the context and the listed conditions.

Model the context
- Timeline (discrete): time0: event1 happens (initially). After an event1 time, the next time must be event2; after event2 the next time must be event1. So event1 holds at even times (0,2,4,...) and fails at odd times.

Evaluate the conditions
1. C1: ""Event1 always happens."" — false (event1 does not occur at odd times).
2. C2: same as C1 — false.
3. C3: ""C2 always holds."" — false because C2 is false.
4. C4: ""If event1 happens, then C3 holds."" At time0 event1 happens but C3 is false, so the implication is false. Therefore C4 is false.
5. C5: ""If C1 holds, then C4 holds."" Since C1 is false, the implication ""if C1 then C4"" is vacuously true. So C5 holds.
6. C6: ""C5 does not hold."" But we just found C5 holds, so C6 is false.
7. C7: ""C6 always holds."" Since C6 is false, C7 is false.

Conclusion
- C7 is False.
---
Step 1 — what's being asked
- We must decide whether C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true or false given the context and the listed conditions. Final answer should be either ""True"" or ""False"".

Step 2 — the context (event sequence)
- Initially event1 happened (time t0).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so t1: event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so t2: event1), and this alternation continues.
- So the timeline is event1 at t0, event2 at t1, event1 at t2, event2 at t3, … ; event1 does not hold at every time, only at even times.

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Given the alternating sequence, event1 does not hold at times when event2 happens → C1 is false.
- C2: same as C1 → C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is false, C3 is false.
- C4: ""If event1 happens, then C3 holds."" At times when event1 happens, C3 is false, so the implication is false → C4 is false.
- C5: ""If C1 holds, then C4 holds."" Since C1 is false, the implication C1 → C4 is vacuously true → C5 is true.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" But we just found C5 is true, so C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" C6 is false, so C7 is false.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C7 is False.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Events alternate: event1 happened initially; after event1, event2 must happen; after event2, event1 must happen. So event1 does not occur at every time point (there are times when event2 occurs).

Step 2 — evaluate the named conditions:
- C1 and C2: ""Event1 always happens."" Given the alternation, these are false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is false, C3 is false.
- C4: ""If event1 happens, then C3 holds."" C3 is false, and event1 does happen (initially and repeatedly), so the implication is false (at least at the initial time).
- C5: ""If C1 holds, then C4 holds."" C1 is false, so this implication is vacuously true.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" Since C5 is true, C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" C6 is false, so C7 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
We are asked whether C6 (""C5 eventually holds"") is true given the scenario.

Step-by-step reasoning:

- System setup: at the initial state event2 has happened. By the rules, immediately after that (in the next state) event1 must happen. After event1, no further events can occur.
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" At the initial state, the next state has event1 (not event2), so C1 is false there. After event1 there are no events at all, so C1 is false at every state. Therefore C1 never holds.
- C2 and C3: each is ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 never holds, both C2 and C3 are false.
- C4: ""C2 or C3"" is false (both disjuncts false).
- C5: ""C4 always holds"" is false because C4 is already false at the initial state (so it is not globally true).
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds"" asks if there is some future state from which C4 holds at all future states. Because C4 is false at every state, there is no such future state, so C6 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is being asked
- We must determine the truth value of C6 given the context and the chain of conditions C1–C5.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initial state s0: event2 happened.
- Rule: after event2, event1 must happen. Interpreting “after” as the next step ⇒ in s1 event1 happens.
- Rule: after event1, no other events can happen ⇒ no future state after s1 contains any events.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions step by step
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state.” At s0 the next state s1 has event1 (not event2). So C1 is false at s0.
- C2: “C1 eventually holds.” That asks whether at some future time there will be a state from which the next state has event2. After s1 no events can happen, so there is no future state whose next state has event2. Thus C2 is false.
- C3: same as C2, so false.
- C4: “C2 holds or C3 holds.” Both are false, so C4 is false.
- C5: “C4 always holds.” Since C4 is already false at the initial state, C5 is false.
- C6: “C5 eventually holds.” C5 is false and will never become true under the given rules, so C6 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
First: the question is whether C6 is true given the context.

Interpretation and timeline
- Initial state s0: event2 happened.
- By the context, after event2 the next state s1 must have event1.
- After event1, no other events can happen, so s2, s3, ... have no events.

Evaluate the conditions at states
- C1 (""event2 happens in the next state""): at s0 the next state s1 has event1, not event2, and at all later states no event2 occurs. So C1 is false at every state.
- C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") and C3 (same as C2): since C1 never becomes true at any future state, C2 and C3 are false at every state.
- C4 (C2 or C3): false (both disjuncts are false).
- C5 (""C4 always holds""): false, because C4 is false already at s0 (and everywhere).
- C6 (""C5 eventually holds""): false, because there is no future state at which C5 becomes true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context we have an infinite alternation starting with event1: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...
2. C1 (""event1 eventually happens"") is true: event1 already happened initially and recurs infinitely, so there is always a future event1.
3. C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is true because from the next state there will still be a future event1.
4. By the same argument each of C3 and C4 (the successive ""holds in the next state"" statements) is true: at every state there will be a future event1, so the chain continues.
5. C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true because C4 holds at every state in the infinite alternating sequence.
6. C6 (""C5 always holds"") is then also true (C5 is a global property, so it holds at every state).
7. C7 asserts ""C6 does not hold."" But we just showed C6 does hold, so C7 is false.
---
Step 1 — understand the context
- Initial state (s0): event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so s1: event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so s2: event1), and this alternation continues forever: s0:event1, s1:event2, s2:event1, s3:event2, ...

Step 2 — interpret the Ci formulas
- C1: ""event1 eventually happens"" (from the current state).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" = X C1.
- C3: X C2 = X^2 C1.
- In general Cn = X^{n-1} C1 for n≥1.
- C5: ""C4 always holds"" = G(C4).
- C6: ""C5 always holds"" = G(C5).
- C7: ""C6 does not hold"" = ¬C6.

Step 3 — evaluate on the alternating trace
- Event1 occurs at s0 and at every even-index state, so ""event1 eventually happens"" (C1) is true at every state.
- Because C1 is true at every state, X^{k-1} C1 is true at s0 for every finite k, hence C1, C2, C3, C4, ... are all true at s0.
- C4 is true at every state, so G(C4) (C5) is true at s0.
- Since C5 holds at every state, G(C5) (C6) is also true.
- Therefore C6 holds, so C7 = ¬C6 is false.

Final answer:
False

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. From the context: event1 happened initially. After event1, event2 must happen; after event2, event1 must happen. So event2 will occur (and in fact will occur repeatedly as the two alternate).  
2. C1 (""Event2 always happens"") is true under this interpretation.  
3. C2 (""C1 holds or event2 happens"") is true because C1 is true.  
4. C3 (""Event2 always happens"") is the same as C1, so true.

6. C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is false, since C4 holds.  
7. C6 (""Event2 always happens"") is true.  
8. C7 (""C5 holds and C6 holds"") is false because C5 is false (conjunction with true C6 yields false).

The hypothesis asks whether C7 (C5 holds and C6 holds) is true given the context.

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Context: initially event1 happened; after event1 event2 must happen; after event2 event1 must happen. So event2 will occur (indeed infinitely often) following the initial event1.

2. C1: ""Event2 always happens."" True (given the alternating requirement starting from the initial event1).

3. C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" Since C1 is true, C2 is true.

4. C3: ""Event2 always happens."" Same as C1, so true.

5. C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" Both C2 and C3 are true, so C4 is true.

6. C5: ""C4 does not hold."" False (because C4 does hold).

7. C6: ""Event2 always happens."" True (same as C1/C3).

8. C7: ""C5 holds and C6 holds."" That is False AND True, which is False.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 does occur after that event1).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 occurs after event2).
Thus the system alternates: event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → … . Event2 occurs repeatedly, but not at every moment (there are times when event1 holds instead).

Step 2 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Interpreting ""always"" as the standard universal/temporal meaning (holds at all times), this is false because there are times when event1 holds instead of event2.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" The second disjunct ""event2 happens"" is true (event2 does occur), so C2 is true (true OR anything = true).
- C3: same as C1, so false.
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" C2 is true, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 holds, C5 is false.
- C6: same as C1, so false.
- C7: ""C5 holds and C6 holds."" C5 is false (and C6 is false), so the conjunction is false.

Sample responses:
Answer: False

Reasoning step by step:

1. From the context:
   - Initially event1 happened.
   - After event1, no other events can happen.
   Therefore no events can ever occur after the initial moment. In particular, event2 never happens.

2. Evaluate C1–C4 at the initial (and only relevant) time:
   - C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" Since event1 already happened, C1 is true.
   - C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Because event1 did happen and C1 is true, C2 is true.
   - C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" C2 does hold, so for C3 to be true we would require event2 to happen. But event2 never happens, so C3 is false.
   - C4: ""If event1 happens, then C3 holds."" Event1 did happen, but C3 is false, so C4 is false.

3. Now the ""eventually"" chain:
   - C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" Since no events (and hence no changes) can occur after the initial time, C4 will never become true later. So C5 is false.
   - C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" Same reasoning: C5 is never true, so C6 is false.
   - C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" Likewise false.

Therefore C7 is False.
---
Step 1 — what is asked
We must decide whether C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is true or false given the context and the definitions C1–C7.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially event1 happened (so event1 is true at the initial time).
- After event1, no other events can happen — so no events (including event2) can occur at or after the initial time.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant if event2 never occurs; but combined with the previous point it implies event2 cannot occur at any time (there is no time before the initial event1, and no events can occur after it).

Thus event1 occurs (now) and event2 never occurs.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions at the initial time
- C1: ""event2 happens or event1 happens."" True, because event1 happened.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" True, since event1 happened and C1 is true.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" C2 does hold, so C3 requires event2 to happen. But event2 never happens, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""If event1 happens, then C3 holds."" event1 does happen, but C3 is false, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" C4 is false now, and nothing changes in the future (no events can occur), so C4 will never hold. Therefore C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" Since C5 is false and will never become true, C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" Since C6 is false and will never become true, C7 is false.

Step 4 — conclusion
C7 is False.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — Interpret the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true.
- After event1, event2 must happen. So event2 will happen (at some later time).
- After event2, no other events can happen. So event2 is terminal, but that doesn't prevent event2 from happening after event1.

Thus in the actual timeline: event1 happens (initially) and then event2 happens. Both event1 and event2 are true.

Step 2 — Evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" True (both happen).
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Since event2 does happen and C1 is true, the conditional is true. (Equivalently: in the actual timeline event2 ⇒ event1 holds because event1 already happened.)
- C3: same as C1, so True.
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" Both C2 and C3 hold, so C4 is True.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" False, because C4 is true.
- C6: ""If event2 happens, then C5 holds."" Event2 happens but C5 is false, so this conditional is false.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" Since C6 is false, C7 is True.

Final answer:

---
Step 1 — what the context gives:
- Initially event1 happens.
- After event1, event2 must happen → event2 happens.
- After event2, no other events can happen (no extra events needed).
So both event1 and event2 occur (event1 = True, event2 = True).

Step 2 — evaluate conditions:
- C1: event2 and event1 — True.
- C2: if event2 then C1. Antecedent (event2) is True and C1 is True, so C2 is True.
- C3: event2 and event1 — True (same as C1).
- C4: C2 or C3 — True (both are True).
- C5: not C4 — False.
- C6: if event2 then C5. Antecedent True but C5 is False, so C6 is False.
- C7: not C6 — True.

Final answer:
True
---
Step 1 — what is asked
You are asked whether C7 (""C6 does not hold"") is True or False, given the context and the chain of conditions C1–C6.

Step 2 — facts from the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 is true.
- After event1, event2 must happen. So event2 will happen (event2 is true).
- After event2, no other events can happen — this only blocks events after event2, it does not contradict event1 having happened before event2.

So both event1 and event2 happen.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" True (both events happen).
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" C1 is true, so this implication is true.
- C3: same as C1, so True.
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" At least one is true (in fact both), so C4 is True.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is True, C5 is False.
- C6: ""If event2 happens, then C5 holds."" Event2 does happen but C5 is False, so this implication is False.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" C6 is False, so C7 is True.

Sample responses:
Identify the question
- We must determine whether C7 (which says ""C6 does not hold"") is true in the initial state, given the context and the Ci definitions.

Interpretation and timeline
- Model discrete states s0, s1, s2,...
- Context: initially event1 happened at s0.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" ⇒ no events at s1, s2, ...
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" never becomes relevant because event2 never occurs (no events after s0).

Evaluate the conditions at the initial state s0
- C1: (event1 → event2). At s0 event1 is true but event2 is false, so C1 is false at s0.
- C2: next(C1). C1 in s1: there event1 is false, so (event1 → event2) is vacuously true. Thus C2 is true at s0.
- C3: C2 ∧ event1. Both parts are true at s0, so C3 is true at s0.
- C4: next(C3). C3 in s1 requires event1 at s1, but there are no events at s1, so C3 is false in s1. Thus C4 is false at s0.
- C5: next(C4). C4 is false in s1, so C5 is false at s0.
- C6: ¬C5. Since C5 is false, C6 is true at s0.
- C7: ¬C6. Since C6 is true, C7 is false at s0.

Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. Timeline from the context: initially event2 has occurred; therefore (by the rule) event1 must occur afterwards — so in the next state event1 happens. After that state no further events can occur (the run is terminal after event1).

2. Evaluate the Ci’s given that timeline:
   - C1 and C2: “Event1 does not happen.” Either as a current-state claim or a global claim, they cannot both assert that event1 never happens (that would contradict the context). In any case, in the state after event2 but before event1, C1/C2 may hold temporarily, but event1 does occur in the next state.
   - C3: “If C2 holds, then event1 happens.” Given the timeline, whenever C2 holds, event1 does indeed happen (so C3 is true, and if C2 were false C3 is vacuously true).
   - C4: “If C1 holds, then C3 holds.” If C1 is false this implication is vacuously true; if C1 is true then C3 is true as just noted. So C4 is true in all states of the run.
   - C5: “C4 always holds.” From the previous line, C4 holds in every state, so C5 is true.
   - C6: “C5 does not hold.” That contradicts the previous line, so C6 is false.
   - C7: “C6 holds in the next state.” Since C6 is false, C7 is false.

Sample responses:
Step 1 — What is asked
We must decide whether C6 (""C5 always holds"") is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — Understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened (so at the initial state event1 has occurred).
- After event1, no other events can happen. That means from the initial state there is no transition where any other event (including event2) can occur.
- Also, ""after event2, no other events can happen"" but that is irrelevant because event2 cannot occur after the initial event1.

Step 3 — Examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" From the context, after event1 no other events can happen, so event2 cannot happen next. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2 and C3: Each is ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" Since C1 is false, C2 and C3 are false.
- C4: ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds."" The antecedent (event2 happens) is false in the reachable scenario, so the implication is vacuously true. Thus C4 is true.
- C5: ""C2 holds and C4 holds."" C2 is false and C4 is true, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" Since C5 is already false in the actual (initial) state, C5 is not always true. Therefore C6 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — interpret the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.

Because event1 happened initially and after event1 nothing else can happen, no further events (including event2) can ever happen after the initial state.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1 (event2 happens in the next state): False, since no events can follow the initial event1.
- C2 and C3 (both: C1 holds and event1 happens): False, because C1 is false (event1 did happen, but C1 is false).
- C4 (if event2 happens, then C3 holds): True — the antecedent (event2 happens) never occurs, so the implication is vacuously true.
- C5 (C2 holds and C4 holds): False, because C2 is false.
- C6 (C5 always holds): False, since C5 does not hold (it fails in the initial state), so it cannot be true always.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what is asked
C6 states ""C5 always holds."" We must decide whether that is true given the context.

Step 2 — facts from the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has occurred, no further events can occur.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Event2 would also be terminal, but that doesn't matter because of the previous line.)

Because event1 already happened initially and it prevents any further events, event2 cannot occur in any next state.

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" — False (event2 cannot happen because event1 already happened and forbids further events).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" — False (C1 is false).
- C3: same as C2 — False.
- C4: ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds."" — True (implication is vacuously true because event2 never happens).
- C5: ""C2 holds and C4 holds."" — False (C2 is false, so the conjunction is false).
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" — False (C5 does not hold now, so it cannot hold always).

Step 1 — what’s being asked
We must decide whether C6 (""C5 holds and event1 happens"") is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context
Initially event2 happened. Also: after event1 no other events can happen, and after event2 no other events can happen. That makes both events terminal: once event2 has occurred (and it did initially), no further events can occur, so event1 does not occur at any time.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" False — event1 never happens (event2 happened initially and is terminal).

- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 would also be terminal if it occurred).

- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" This is false: event1 did not happen in the initial (event2) state and no further events can occur.
- C2 and C3: ""C1 holds in the next state."" There is no next state after the initial event2, so C1 does not hold in a next state; C2 and C3 are false.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 is false, C4 is true.
- C5: ""C2 holds and C4 holds."" C2 is false and C4 is true, so C5 is false.

Step 1 — understand the setting:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
Because event2 happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, there are no subsequent events; in particular event1 never occurs.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" This is false (event1 does not occur at all).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" There is no next state after the initial state (since event2 makes the state terminal), so C2 is false.

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — what’s being asked
We must evaluate whether C6 is true given the context (initial event1, and events alternate: after event1 must come event2, after event2 must come event1). C6 is (C2 holds) AND (C5 holds). So we need truth values of C2 and C5.

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — equivalent to just ""Event1 happens."" Given the context, event1 does happen (initially and repeatedly), so C1 is true (there is at least one moment when event1 happens).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e. event1 holds at all times. Because events alternate, there are times when event2 holds and event1 does not. So C2 is false.
- C3: same as C2 (given text), so C3 is also false.
- C4: same as C1, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds"" — since C3 is false but C4 is true, C5 is true.

Step 3 — combine for C6
C6 = C2 AND C5. C2 is false and C5 is true, so the conjunction is false.

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — what’s being asked
- The question asks whether C6 is true or false given the context.

Step 2 — unpack the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — equivalent to ""Event1 happens"" (a redundant conjunction).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — C1 is true at every time point.
- C3: ""C1 always holds"" — same as C2.
- C4: same as C1.
- C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds"" — so C5 ≡ (C2 or C4).
- C6: ""C2 holds and C5 holds"" ≡ C2 and (C2 or C4) ≡ C2. So C6 is equivalent to C2.

Step 3 — evaluate against the context
- Context: initially event1 happened; after event1 event2 must happen; after event2 event1 must happen. That forces an alternation of event1 and event2 — event1 does not hold at all times (it holds at some times, but not continuously/always).
- Therefore ""C1 always holds"" (C2) is false.

Conclusion
- Since C6 ≡ C2 and C2 is false, C6 is False.

Final answer: False
---
Goal: determine truth of C6.

1) Understand the scenario: initially event1 occurs. After any event1, event2 must occur. After any event2, event1 must occur. So the system produces an alternating sequence event1, event2, event1, event2, ... In particular event1 does occur (at the start and repeatedly), but there are times when event2 is occurring and event1 is not.

2) Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" is equivalent to ""Event1 happens"". True (event1 does happen).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" means ""event1 holds at all times"". This is false because there are times when event2 occurs and event1 does not hold.
- C3: same as C2, so false.
- C4: same as C1, so true.
- C5: C3 holds or C4 holds → false or true → true.
- C6: C2 holds and C5 holds → false and true → false.

Therefore C6 is False."

Final answer by majority vote: False

Sample responses:
Step 1 — identify the claim
- C7 says: not (Event1 happens OR (in the next state, eventually Event1 happens)). We must decide whether that negation is true given the context.

Step 2 — simplify conditions
- C1 and C2 are both ""Event1 happens or Event1 happens"", i.e. just ""Event1 happens"".
- C3 is C1 and C2, so again ""Event1 happens"".
- C4 is ""C3 eventually holds"" → ""Event1 happens eventually"".
- C5 is ""C4 holds in the next state"" → from the next state, Event1 will eventually happen.
- C6 is ""Event1 happens OR C5"" → either Event1 happens now, or from the next state Event1 will eventually happen.
- C7 is the negation of C6.

Step 3 — use the context
- Initially Event2 happened.
- The context requires: after Event2, Event1 must happen (so after the initial state, Event1 is guaranteed sometime in the future).
- Therefore ""Event1 happens eventually"" (C4) is true in the initial state.
- That implies that in the next state too, Event1 will still be guaranteed to occur eventually (C5 is true).
- Hence C6 (""Event1 now OR C5"") is true in the initial state (specifically because C5 holds).

Step 4 — conclusion about C7
- C7 asserts that C6 does not hold. But we have C6 true, so C7 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Goal: determine truth of C7 given the context.

Context (interpreted temporally, at initial state t0):
- Initially (t0) event2 happened.
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur next.
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur next.
Thus events alternate, and since event2 occurs at t0, event1 must occur at t1 (the next state).

Examine the conditions at the initial state t0:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" → simplifies to ""Event1 happens"" (at the state being evaluated). At t0, event1 does not happen, so C1 is false at t0.
- C2: same as C1 → false at t0.
- C3: C1 and C2 → false and false = false at t0.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" — is there some future state where C3 holds? C3 is just ""event1 holds"" (since C1 and C2 both reduce to event1). Event1 does occur at t1, so C3 will hold at t1. Therefore C4 is true at t0.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" — we check C4 at t1. At t1, event1 happens immediately, so ""C3 eventually holds"" is true at t1 as well (event1 holds at t1). Thus C5 is true at t0.
- C6: ""Event1 happens or C5 holds"" — at t0 event1 does not happen, but C5 holds, so C6 is true at t0.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold"" — since C6 is true at t0, C7 is false at t0.

Therefore C7 is False.
---
Goal: determine truth of C7 (""C6 does not hold"").

1) Interpret conditions:
- Initially event2 has happened; event1 has not happened yet.
- Rules: after event1, event2 must happen (event2 eventually); after event2, event1 must happen (event1 eventually). So from any state where event2 just occurred, event1 will occur at some future state (and they alternate indefinitely).

2) Simplify C1–C3:
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event1 happens"" ≡ Event1 (holds now).
- C2 is the same ≡ Event1.
- C3 = C1 and C2 ≡ Event1 (holds now).

3) C4 = ""C3 eventually holds"" ≡ ""eventually Event1"". Given the context (after event2, event1 must happen), C4 is true in the initial state.

4) C5 = ""C4 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in the next state it is still true that eventually Event1 will occur. Because the obligations force Event1 to occur after Event2, from the next state Event1 will still eventually occur. So C5 is true.

5) C6 = ""Event1 happens (now) or C5 holds"". Event1 does not hold now, but C5 does, so C6 is true.

6) C7 = ""C6 does not hold"" = not C6, therefore false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Context: Initially event2 occurred. The rules say (1) after event2 no other events can happen, and (2) after event1, event2 must happen.
- C1 and C2 state “event2 happens in the next state.” Given the context, we are already in a state where event2 occurred initially, and no other events can happen after event2. Thus there is no way for event1 to occur after that initial event2, and there is no basis to assert that event2 must also occur in the next state. So C1 and C2 do not hold.
- C3 = C1 and C2 is therefore false. C4 = C3 and event1 is also false (it requires C3 and an occurrence of event1, but event1 cannot occur after event2). C5 equals C1 (false), C6 (“C5 always holds”) is false.
- C7 = C4 and C6 is therefore false.

Hence C7 is False.
---
We are asked whether C7 is true given:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1, event2 must happen.

Interpret C1..C7:
- C1: event2 happens in the next state.
- C2: same as C1.
- C3: C1 and C2 (so requires event2 in the next state).
- C4: C3 and event1 happens (requires event2 next and event1 happens now).
- C5: event2 happens in the next state (again).
- C6: C5 always holds (i.e., at every state, event2 happens in the next state).
- C7: C4 and C6.

Reasoning:
- Since event2 already happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, the next state after the initial state has no events; in particular event2 does not occur in that next state. So C1 (and C2, C5) are false.
- C3 is false because it requires C1 and C2.
- C4 is false because it requires event1 to happen, but no events can happen after event2, so event1 cannot happen.
- C6 is false because it asserts that ""event2 happens in the next state"" at every state, but we already have a state (the initial state) whose next state does not have event2.
- Therefore C7 = C4 and C6 is false.

Final answer:
False
---
We want to know whether C7 is true given the context.

Context summary:
- Initially event2 has happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has occurred, there are no further events).
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 ever occurs, event2 must occur afterwards).

Evaluate the Ci's:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Since event2 already happened initially and no events can happen after event2, event2 does not (and no event does) in the next state. So C1 is false.
- C2 is the same as C1, so C2 is false.
- C3 = C1 and C2, therefore false.
- C4 = C3 and event1 happens. C3 is false, and event1 cannot happen after the initial event2 (no events after event2), so C4 is false.
- C5 is the same event2-next-state claim, so false.
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" C5 is false now, so C6 is false.

Answer: False

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. So event2 does occur, and event1 cannot occur at any time (there is no earlier moment for event1; once event2 has happened nothing else can happen).

2. C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Given event2 happened initially (and there is no trace without event2), C1 holds.

3. C2 and C3: each is ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" Since C1 is true (and also event2 happens), both C2 and C3 hold.

4. C4: ""If C3 holds, then event1 happens."" C3 does hold, so for C4 to be true event1 must happen. But event1 does not and cannot happen (because event2 already happened and prevents any further events). Therefore C4 is false.

5. C5: ""C2 holds and C4 holds."" Since C4 is false, C5 is false.

6. C6: ""C5 always holds."" Because C5 is false, C6 is false.

Thus C6 is False.
---
Step 1 — identify the question
- We must decide whether C6 (""C5 always holds"") is true given the context rules.

Step 2 — restate the context
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so event2 is terminal).
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs, event2 must follow).

Step 3 — examine possible event sequences
- Because event2 happens initially and no events can occur after event2, the only actual sequence is: event2 happened, and event1 never occurs.

Step 4 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" True — event2 did happen (in the only possible execution).
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" True — C1 holds (and event2 happens anyway).
- C3: same as C2, so True.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event1 happens."" C3 does hold, but event1 does not happen in any execution, so C4 is False.
- C5: ""C2 holds and C4 holds."" C2 is True but C4 is False, so C5 is False.
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" Since C5 is false, C6 is False.

Final answer: False

False

- The question asks whether C6 (""C5 always holds"") is true.

- From the context: event2 happened initially, and after event2 no other events can occur. The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" is an implication but does not force event1 to occur.

- Evaluate the conditions:
  - C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Given event2 happened initially, C1 is true.
  - C2 and C3: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" Since C1 is true, both C2 and C3 are true.
  - C4: ""If C3 holds, then event1 happens."" C3 does hold, so C4 requires event1 to happen. But event1 cannot happen after event2 (and event2 already happened initially), so event1 does not occur. Therefore C4 is false.
  - C5: ""C2 holds and C4 holds."" C2 is true but C4 is false, so C5 is false.
  - C6: ""C5 always holds."" Since C5 is false, C6 is false.

Therefore C6 is False."

Sample responses:
We must decide whether C6 (""C5 does not hold"") is true or false.

1) Understand the setting and what is asked
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
We are asked whether C6 is true or false given these facts.

2) Examine each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" Given event2 happens initially and both event1 and event2 are terminal (no other events can happen after either), there is no run in which both distinct events happen. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" There is no next state after the initial event2 (no further events), so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 is false and there are no future states, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Same as C2, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" This is an implication C3 → C4. Because C3 is false, the implication is true (a false antecedent makes the implication true).
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" Since C5 is true, C6 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Step 1 — understand the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so there is no successor state after the initial one).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 would also be terminal).

Step 2 — evaluate C1–C4
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" Given the initial fact that event2 happened and no other events can happen afterwards, event1 does not happen. So C1 is false.
- C2 / C4: ""C1 holds in the next state."" There is no next state (no events can occur after event2), so C1 does not hold in the next state; C2 and C4 are false.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 is false and there is no future state where C2 can become true, C3 is false.

Step 3 — evaluate C5 and C6
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" This implication is vacuously true because C3 is false.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" Since C5 is true, C6 is false.

Final answer: False
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. Therefore event1 never occurs (there is no state where event1 happens after the initial event2).
- C1 (event2 happens and event1 happens) is false (event1 never happens).
- C2 (C1 holds in the next state) is false.
- C3 (C2 eventually holds) is false (since C2 is never true).
- C4 (C1 holds in the next state) is the same as C2, so false.
- C5 (if C3 then C4) is an implication with a false antecedent (C3 is false), so C5 is true.
- C6 is ""C5 does not hold"" — since C5 holds, C6 is false."

Sample responses:
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Simplify the C-conditions:
  - C1 = event1 ∧ event1 = event1.
  - C2 = C1 ∧ event1 = event1, and similarly C3–C5 all simplify to event1.
  - C6 = event1 ∨ C5 = event1.
  - C7 = ""C6 holds in the next state"" = ""event1 holds at the next state.""

- Timeline using the context (where ""after"" means in the next state):
  - At time 0: event1 holds (given).
  - By ""after event1, event2 must happen"", at time 1: event2 must hold.
  - By ""after event2, event1 must happen"", at time 2: event1 must hold.

- At time 1 (the ""next state"" from the initial state), event1 does not hold (event2 holds instead), so C6 is false at time 1. Therefore C7 (""event1 holds in the next state"") is false.
---
Identify the question
- C7 asserts: ""C6 holds in the next state."" We must decide whether C7 is true in the initial state given the context.

Understand the context and timeline
- Initially (state S0): event1 holds.
- Rules: after event1, event2 must happen (so in the next state S1 event2 holds); after event2, event1 must happen (so S2 event1, S3 event2, etc.).
- Thus the states alternate: S0: event1, S1: event2, S2: event1, S3: event2, ...

Examine the conditions in the relevant states
- All Ci up to C5 are just repeated conjunctions of event1, so they are equivalent to ""event1 holds in this state.""
  - At S0: event1 is true, so C1..C5 are true, C6 = event1 OR C5 is true.
  - C7 = ""C6 holds in the next state"" — so we must evaluate C6 in S1.
- At S1: event1 is false (S1 has event2), so any condition that requires event1 is false.
  - C5 (requires event1) is false in S1.
  - C6 = event1 OR C5 is therefore false in S1.

Conclusion
- C6 does not hold in the next state S1, so C7 is false.

Final answer: False
---
Answer: False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Identify hypothesis: C7 is ""C6 holds in the next state.""
- Simplify the Ci chain: each Ci is just a conjunction/or combination that reduces to ""event1 happens"" in the current state (C1..C6 all equivalent to event1 in the current state).
- So C7 asks whether event1 holds in the next state.
- From the context: initially event1 holds now. The rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" guarantees event2 in the next state (it does not guarantee event1 in the next state). The other rule (""after event2, event1 must happen"") would force event1 only in the following state after a state with event2.
- Therefore event1 is not guaranteed to hold in the next state (only event2 is guaranteed), so C7 is not necessarily true.

Thus C7 is False."

Sample responses:
Identify the question
- The hypothesis asks whether C7 is True or False.

Interpret the context
- Initially event1 has occurred.
- After event1, no other events can ever occur. Since event1 already happened initially, no further events (including event2) can ever happen.
- The requirement ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never occurs in this setting.

Examine the conditions step by step (informal temporal reasoning)
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" This is false because event2 can never occur after the initial event1.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" That reduces to ""eventually (eventually event2)"" which is equivalent to ""eventually event2"" — still false.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Since C2 is false everywhere, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" False because C3 is false everywhere.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" False for the same reason.
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" False because C5 does not hold.
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" Since C6 is false, C7 is false.

Conclusion
- C7 is False.
---
The hypothesis asks whether C7 is true given the context.

Interpret the conditions in temporal terms:
- C1 = ""event2 eventually happens"" = F(event2).
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" = F(C1) = F(F(event2)) which is equivalent to F(event2) (so C2 ≡ C1).
- C3 = ""C2 holds in the next state"" = X(C2).
- C4 = F(C3), C5 = F(C4), C6 = G(C5), C7 = X(C6).

From the context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen → event2 can never happen at any future time.
Therefore F(event2) is false, so C1 is false. Since C2 ≡ C1, C2 is false. Then X(C2) (C3) is false, and iterating F/G/X over false keeps them false (C4, C5, C6, C7 all false).

Final answer:
False
---
Step 1 — interpret the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen → from the initial state onward, event2 never occurs.
- The rule ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant because event2 never occurs.

Step 2 — evaluate C1..C7
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Since event2 never occurs, C1 is false (in every state).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" C1 is false in every state, so there is no future state where C1 becomes true → C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" C2 is false in every state, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 never becomes true, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" C4 never becomes true, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" C5 is false (and not true at any future state), so C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" C6 is false, so C7 is false.

Sample responses:
Goal: determine whether C7 (""C6 always holds"") is True or False.

1) Understand the setting:
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- (Also: after event1 no other events can happen, but event1 never occurs here.)

So the system starts in a state where event2 has occurred, and from then on no further events occur. In particular, event1 does not occur in the initial state and cannot occur later.

2) Examine the conditions:
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" This is false because the initial state does not have event1, and no future events can introduce event1.
- C2: same as C1, so also false.
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" Event2 does happen initially, so the antecedent is true; since C2 is false, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C1 holds or C3 holds."" Both C1 and C3 are false, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" C4 is false now and cannot become true later (no events can change the truth of the ""always"" statements), so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" Since C5 is false, C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" C6 is false, so C7 is false.

Conclusion: C7 is False.
---
False

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. The initial fact: event2 happened in the initial state, and after event2 no further events can occur. So event1 never occurs (there is no state in which event1 happens).

2. C1 and C2 are both ""Event1 always happens."" Since event1 never occurs, C1 and C2 are false.

3. C3 is ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" The antecedent (event2 happens) is true, but the consequent C2 is false, so C3 is false.

4. C4 is C1 or C3; both disjuncts are false, so C4 is false.

5. C5 is ""C4 eventually holds."" Since C4 is false in every reachable state, C5 is false.

6. C6 is ""C5 holds in the next state."" There is no next state after the initial state (no further events), so C6 does not hold (Next would be false), hence C6 is false.

7. C7 is ""C6 always holds."" Since C6 is false, C7 is false.

Therefore C7 is False.
---
Reasoning:

- Initially event2 happens and after event2 no further events can occur. So event1 never happens (it does not occur initially and cannot occur later).
- C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false. C2 is the same, so false.
- C3 (""If event2 happens, then C2 holds"") is false because event2 does happen but C2 is false (so the implication is false).
- C4 (C1 or C3) is false (both disjuncts false).
- C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is false because there are no future states where C4 could become true.
- C6 (""C5 holds in the next state"") is false (there is no next state where C5 could hold).
- C7 (""C6 always holds"") is therefore false.
