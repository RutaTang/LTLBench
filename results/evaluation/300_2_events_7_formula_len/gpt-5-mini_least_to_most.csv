Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- So events alternate: event1, event2, event1, event2, ... (event2 occurs repeatedly after the first event1).

3) What each sub-condition says
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" (Same text as C2.)
- C2: ""Event2 always happens.""
  Note: ""always"" is slightly ambiguous (every time instant vs. inevitably/infinitely often). That ambiguity does not affect the conclusion below.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" This is the implication C1 → C2.
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" (Same as C3.)
- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" (C3 ∧ C4)

4) How the conditions relate and truth value of C5
- C1 and C2 are the same statement. So C3 and C4 are of the form A → A (where A is ""Event2 always happens"").
- Any implication A → A is logically true (a tautology), regardless of whether A itself is true or false.
- Therefore both C3 and C4 are true; hence their conjunction C5 is true.

So C5 is True. (This conclusion does not depend on whether ""Event2 always happens"" is actually true in the system.)

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (so at the initial state event2 has occurred).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1 occurs, event2 must happen (whenever event1 happens it is followed by event2).
- After event2 occurs, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal: no further events after it).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" (same content)
- C2: ""Event1 does not happen."" (identical to C1)
- C3: ""Event1 does not happen."" (identical to C1 and C2)
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" — i.e. in the next state, event1 does not happen.
- C5: ""If C4 holds, then event2 happens."" — if event1 does not happen in the next state, then event2 happens.
- C6: ""C2 holds or C5 holds."" — either event1 does not happen (C2) or the implication of C5 holds.
- C7: ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds."" — if event1 does not happen, then (C2 or C5) holds.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and whether C7 is true
- C1 and C2 are the same statement. So C1 ⇒ C2 is automatically true.
- C6 is (C2 ∨ C5). If C2 is true, then (C2 ∨ C5) is true, so C6 is true.
- Therefore C1 ⇒ C6 holds: whenever C1 is true, C2 is true, hence C6 is true.

Conclusion
- C7 is True.

(If you intended C1, C2, C3 to refer to different times or different scoped propositions rather than identical claims, say so — the conclusion could change with a different intended reading. Under the given text they are identical, so C7 is true.)

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 holds in the initial state (it already happened).

2) Transition rules (interpreting “after X …” as “in the next state after a state where X holds”)
- Rule A: If event2 happens in some state, then event1 must hold in the next state.
- Rule B: If event1 happens in some state, then no other events can happen afterward (i.e., in all future states after that state there are no events — in particular event2 cannot occur after event1).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: event2 holds in the next state (from the current state).
- C2: same as C1 (duplicate).
- C3: (C2) or (event2 holds now). So C3 is true iff either event2 holds now or event2 holds in the next state.
- C4: C3 always holds (globally true in all states).
- C5: C1 holds or C4 holds.
- C6: C5 always holds (globally).
- C7: C6 does not hold.

4) How they relate under the given rules
- From the initial condition we know event1 has happened. By Rule B, once event1 has happened no further events can happen in any future state. Therefore event2 cannot occur now or in any future (including the next) state.
- So C1 (event2 in the next state) is false.
- C2 is false (same).
- C3 (event2 now or event2 next) is false.
- C4 (C3 always) is false.
- C5 (C1 or C4) is false.
- C6 (C5 always) is false.
- Therefore C7 (“C6 does not hold”) is true.

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state (call it state 0), event2 happened (so event2 is true at state 0).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen in the next state: (event1 at time t) ⇒ (event2 at time t+1).
- After event2, event1 must happen in the next state: (event2 at time t) ⇒ (event1 at time t+1).
- With event2 at state 0 this forces alternation: state0: event2, state1: event1, state2: event2, state3: event1, … (the two events alternate forever).

3) What does each sub-condition mean (interpreting them at the initial state unless otherwise noted)?
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" Logically this is event2 ⇒ event2, which is a tautology (always true when interpreted as a plain material implication).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is a tautology, it holds in every state, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Because C2 is true in every state, it is also true in the next state; so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This is the negation of C3. Since C3 is true, C4 is false.
- C5: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" Same as C1, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds."" This is an implication (C4 ⇒ C5). An implication with a false antecedent is true, so because C4 is false, C6 is true.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" The ""eventually"" operator asks whether there exists some state at or after the current one where C6 is true. C6 is already true at the current (initial) state, so ""eventually C6"" is true.

4) How these conditions relate and final conclusion
- Because C1 is a tautology it is always true (C2), so C3 is true and C4 (its negation) is false.
- Since C4 is false, the implication C6 (C4 ⇒ C5) is true.
- C6 is true immediately, so C7 (""eventually C6"") is true.

Therefore C7 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: C1 is a state tautology, so C2 (always C1) holds; hence C3 (C2 in the next state) holds and C4 (¬C3) is false. C5 is the same tautology as C1, so C6 (C4 ⇒ C5) is true (antecedent false, and consequent true). Since C6 holds now, ""eventually C6"" (C7) is true."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event2 and event1.
- Initial condition from the context: event2 happened initially.

Step 2 — transition rules between events
- After event2, event1 must happen (event2 → event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — meaning / truth of each sub-condition
Interpret each Ci as a logical statement and evaluate using the context and the given Ci statements:

- C1: “Event2 does not happen.”  
  Given the context says event2 did happen, C1 is false.

- C2: “Event2 does not happen.”  
  Same as C1, so C2 is false.

- C3: “If C2 holds, then event1 happens.” (C2 → event1)  
  As a material implication, with C2 false this implication is vacuously true. Also independently, event1 does happen because event2 happened, so C3 can be regarded as true.

- C4: “If event2 happens, then C3 holds.” (event2 → C3)  
  Since event2 does happen, this requires C3 to hold. From above C3 is true, so C4 is true. (C4 is also stated explicitly in the hypothesis.)

- C5: “C4 always holds.”  
  This is given in the hypothesis; take C5 as true.

- C6: “C5 always holds.”  
  This is also given; take C6 as true.

- C7: “If C1 holds, then C6 holds.” (C1 → C6)  
  We evaluate this below.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and is C7 true or false?
- We have C6 = true (given). An implication A → B is true whenever B is true, regardless of A.  
- Therefore C7 (C1 → C6) is true: the consequent C6 is true, so the implication holds.  

Summary of truth values:  
C1 = False, C2 = False, C3 = True, C4 = True, C5 = True, C6 = True, and therefore C7 = True.

Short answer: C6 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- Because event2 happened initially and it is terminal, event1 cannot happen at any later time. So in this scenario event1 does not happen.

3) What does each sub-condition mean (and their truth values here)?
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Given the initial event2 and its terminality, C1 is True.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" This conjunct contradicts itself (requires event1 both to happen and not happen). Given C1 is True and event1 does not happen, C2 is False.
- C3: Same as C2, so False.
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" Both C2 and C3 are False, so C4 is False.
- C5: ""Event1 happens and C4 holds."" Since event1 does not happen (and C4 is False), C5 is False.
- C6: ""If C5 holds, then event1 happens."" This is an implication. There are two ways to see it:
  a) By definition C5 includes ""Event1 happens"" as part of its conjunction, so C5 -> event1 is logically valid.
  b) In classical logic, an implication with a false antecedent is true; here C5 is False, so the implication is vacuously True.
  Therefore C6 is True.

4) How the conditions relate to each other (summary)
- The initial event2 and the terminality rules make event1 not occur, so C1 is True and all conditions that assert event1 happens (C2, C3, C5) are False. C4 is False because it depends on C2 or C3. C6 is True because C5 implies event1 by construction (and also because C5 is false, making the implication vacuously true).

Final answer: C6 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially, event1 has already happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
Thus both events are terminal. Since event1 already happened initially, no further events can ever occur, so event2 cannot occur at any time.

Step 3 — meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Given the rules and the initial state, this is false (event2 cannot happen).
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" This requires event2 to happen; since C1 is false and event2 cannot happen, C2 is false.
- C3: same as C2 (duplicate) — false.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event1 happens."" This implication has a false antecedent (C3 is false), so in classical logic the implication is true (and independently event1 indeed happened initially). So C4 is true.
- C5: ""C2 holds and C4 holds."" C2 is false, C4 is true, so the conjunction C5 is false.
- C6: ""If C5 holds, then event2 happens."" The antecedent C5 is false, so the implication is true by vacuous truth in classical logic.

Step 4 — how they relate & final answer
- Because event1 occurred initially and blocks further events, C1, C2, C3, and C5 are false; C4 and C6 are true.
- Therefore C6 is True (assuming standard classical implication semantics).

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (so at the start event2 has occurred).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event2, no other events can happen. (Once event2 has happened, nothing else can happen afterwards.)
- Rule B: After event1, no other events can happen. (If event1 happens, nothing else can happen afterwards.)
Because event2 happened initially, Rule A prevents any other events from ever happening after that time.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" (event1 never occurs in the history.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (the proposition C1 is true at all times / globally true.)
- C3: ""Event1 does not happen."" (same as C1.)
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" (an implication from C2 to C3.)
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" (C4 is true at all times.)
- C6: ""Event1 does not happen."" (same as C1/C3.)
- C7: ""If C5 holds, then C6 holds."" (an implication from C5 to C6.)

4) How these conditions relate and evaluation
- From the initial condition and Rule A: because event2 happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, event1 cannot happen at any time. So C1 is true.
- Since event1 never happens, C1 holds at every time; hence the ""always"" statement C2 is true.
- C3 is just a restatement of C1, so C3 is true.
- C4 is the implication (C2 → C3). With C2 true and C3 true, C4 is true.
- C5 says C4 always holds. C4 is true (and is a timeless logical implication here), so C5 is true.
- C6 is again the same as C1 and is true.
- C7 is the implication (C5 → C6). With C5 true and C6 true, C7 is true.

Therefore every Ci in the chain is true, and in particular C7 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (at the initial time).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 occurs, then event1 must occur afterward).
- After event1, no other events can happen (once event1 has occurred, no further events can occur).

From these rules and the initial condition, no events can occur after the initial event1. Therefore event2 does not occur at any later time; given ""initially event1 happened"" there is no room for event2 to occur afterward.

Step 3 — meaning and truth value of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" False (we were told event1 happened initially).
- C2: ""Event1 does not happen."" Same as C1, so False.
- C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" Since C2 is false and event2 does not happen (see Step 2), C3 is False.
- C4: ""Event1 does not happen."" Same as C1, so False.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" This is an implication with a false antecedent (C3 false), so C5 is True (vacuously).
- C6: ""Event2 happens and C5 holds."" Event2 is false, C5 is true, so the conjunction is False.
- C7: ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds."" Antecedent C1 is false, so this implication is vacuously True.

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- Because event1 actually happened initially, all statements asserting ""event1 does not happen"" are false, which makes implications with those as antecedents vacuously true when appropriate.
- In particular, C7 is True, since its antecedent C1 is false (making the implication automatically true).

Answer: C7 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: C1 (""Event1 does not happen"") is false because event1 happened initially. An implication with a false antecedent is true, so ""If C1 then C6"" (C7) is vacuously true."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened at the start (so we have event1 true initially).
- Additional constraint: once event1 has happened, no other events can happen after it (event1 is terminal).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: ""After event2, event1 must happen."" (If event2 happens at some time, then at some later time event1 must occur.)
- Rule B: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" (Once event1 has occurred, nothing else can occur afterwards.)

Given the initial event1 and rule B, no event can occur at or after the initial moment. So there is no occurrence of event2 at or after the initial time. (Unless you allow events before ""initially"", which typical readings do not.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" This is just a redundant way of saying ""event2 happens."" So C1 ≡ (event2 happens).
- C2: same as C1, so C2 ≡ (event2 happens).
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Formally C1 ⇒ C2. Since C1 and C2 are the same statement, this implication is logically true; also, even if C1 were false, an implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuous truth).
- C4: identical to C3.
- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" That is C5 ≡ (C3 ∧ C4).

Step 4 — how they relate and truth values
- From the context, event2 does not happen (because event1 happened initially and no events can happen after event1). So C1 is false and C2 is false.
- In classical logic an implication with a false antecedent is true, so C3 is true and C4 is true.
- Therefore C5 = C3 ∧ C4 is true.

Conclusion
Under the given context and standard (classical) logic, C5 is True.

(If you allowed event2 to have occurred before the ""initial"" event1, then C1/C2 might be true and the implications still hold; the decisive point for C5 is that C3 and C4 are true in either case.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

C1 and C2 are the same proposition (""event2 happens""), so C3 and C4 (C1 ⇒ C2) are true (tautologically or vacuously), and therefore C5 = C3 ∧ C4 is true."

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened in the initial state.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen (state is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (state is terminal).
- Because the initial state already has event2 and event2 is terminal, there are no further states/transitions from the initial state.

3) What does each sub-condition mean (and its truth value here)?
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" False. The initial state has event2 and there are no future states, so event1 never happens.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" False. Since C1 is false at the initial state, it is not true that C1 holds always.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" True, because C2 is false.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" (next(C3)). False. There is no next state (the initial state is terminal), so a ""next"" formula is false in the usual semantics.
- C5: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Same as C1, so False.
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" False (both conjuncts are false).
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" True, because C6 is false.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- C1 false ⇒ C2 false ⇒ C3 true.
- C3 true now does not imply C4 because there is no next state; so C4 is false.
- C5 repeats C1 (false), so C6 (C4 ∧ C5) is false.
- Therefore C7 (""C6 does not hold"") is true.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened in the initial state.
- Also given: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So once event1 has occurred (as it has initially), no further events will occur in any later state.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" So if event2 ever occurs at some time, then event1 must occur afterward.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So once event1 has occurred, the system is (effectively) frozen with respect to events — event2 cannot occur after that point.
- Combining these with the initial condition: event1 already occurred initially, therefore event2 cannot occur at any later time (there is no opportunity for event2 to happen after the initial event1).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1, C2, C3: ""Event2 always happens."" Each of these asserts that event2 holds (in every relevant state). Given the initial event1 and the rule that no events can happen after event1, event2 does not actually occur in any later state; therefore C1, C2, C3 are false.
- C4: C2 or C3. Since C2 and C3 are both false, C4 is false.
- C5: C1 or C4. Since C1 and C4 are false, C5 is false.
- C6: If C5 holds, then event1 happens. This is an implication. Because C5 is false, the implication is true (it is vacuously true when the antecedent is false).
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" This asks whether C6 is true in the immediate successor state.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other, and is C7 true or false?
- Summary of truth values in the current state: C1 = false, C2 = false, C3 = false, C4 = false, C5 = false, C6 = true (vacuously true).
- In any successor state (if one exists) nothing new can happen (no event2), so the same facts about C1–C5 remain false, making C6 remain true there as well. Therefore C6 holds in the next state, so C7 is true.

Caveat about semantics: If your formal system treats ""next"" as undefined or automatically false in a state that has no successor at all (some temporal logics treat terminal states specially), then one could argue C7 is not true because there is no next state to evaluate. Under the usual interpretation where a next state can exist (or we consider the immediate following state where simply no events occur), C7 is true.

Short answer: C6 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (initially event1 happened).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
Because event1 already happened initially and it is terminal, no other event (including event2) can occur after that.

3) What does each sub-condition mean (and its truth value)?
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is equivalent to simply ""event1 happens."" Given the initial condition, C1 is True.
  (The repetition is redundant; it does not require two distinct occurrences.)
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" This requires event2 to happen. But event2 cannot happen because event1 has already occurred and is terminal. So C2 is False.
- C3: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" Same as C2, so C3 is False.
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" Both C2 and C3 are False, so C4 is False.
- C5: ""Event2 happens and C4 holds."" This needs event2 and C4; both are false, so C5 is False.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" Since C5 is False (does not hold), C6 is True.

4) How the conditions relate to each other
- C1 is true and blocks any subsequent events (by the context rule). That makes any condition that requires event2 (C2, C3, C5) impossible/false. Those falses make C4 false, which in turn leaves C5 false, and therefore C6 (the negation of C5) true.

Conclusion: C6 is True.

Reasoning (concise):
- Let p = ""event1"". p is true only in the initial state; in all later states no events occur, so p is false thereafter.
- C1 = G p (""p always""): false (p fails after the initial state).
- C2 = F C1 (""eventually C1""): false (there is no future state from which p holds forever).
- Each subsequent Ci is built from earlier ones using X or F/G, so once a formula is false it stays false under these constructions:

Answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially, event1 happened (so at the initial state event1 is true).

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So once event1 has happened, there are no further events at any later state.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" (Redundant here because event2 never actually happens given the first rule and the initial condition.)
Thus, because event1 already happened initially, event2 cannot occur at any later state.

3) Meaning and truth value of each Ci (evaluated at the initial state unless otherwise stated)
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This is false (because event1 did happen initially).
- C2: same as C1, so false.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" This is the implication C1 -> C2. An implication with identical antecedent and consequent is true (and in any case an implication with a false antecedent is true), so C3 is True.
- C4: ""C3 holds and event2 happens."" C3 is True but event2 does not happen (see step 2), so C4 is False.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" Since C4 is false now and no events can happen after event1, C4 is also false in the next state, so C5 is False.
- C6: ""Event1 does not happen."" Same as C1, so False.
- C7: ""If C5 holds, then C6 holds."" This is the implication C5 -> C6. Because C5 is false, the implication is vacuously true, so C7 is True.

4) How they relate
- The initial truth of event1 makes all ""event1 does not happen"" claims false.
- That same initial event1 prevents event2 from ever occurring, which makes any condition requiring event2 (C4, C5) false.
- Implications with false antecedents (C3, C7) are true, hence C7 is True.

Conclusion: C7 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen. (So if event1 happens, event2 cannot happen afterward.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (Irrelevant here unless event2 happens.)

Step 3 — meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""Event2 does not happen."" (same as C1)
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" i.e. the negation of C2 → ""Event2 does happen.""
- C4: ""C1 holds or C3 holds"" → (Event2 does not happen) OR (Event2 does happen).
- C5: ""C2 does not hold"" — but given C2 is ""Event2 does not happen"", C5 is again the same as C1/C2? (Note: the hypothesis text lists C5 as ""C2 does not hold"" but in your list C5 is written as ""C2 does not hold."" If C5 instead is meant to be the same as C2, treat it as ""Event2 does not happen."" Either way the statements as given reduce to the same core facts; below I assume C5 = ""Event2 does not happen"" as in the list.)
- C6: ""C4 holds or C5 holds.""

Step 4 — how they relate and evaluation
- Because event1 happened and after event1 no other events can happen, event2 does not happen. Therefore C1 and C2 (and C5, as duplicates) are true.
- C3 is the negation of C2, so C3 is false.
- C4 = C1 OR C3 = true OR false = true.
- C6 = C4 OR C5 = true OR true = true.

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (at the initial moment).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: If event2 happens, then event1 must happen afterward (event2 ⇒ eventually event1).
- Rule B: If event1 happens, no other events can happen afterward (event1 is terminal).

Combine these with the initial condition: because event1 already happened initially and event1 forbids any subsequent events, event2 can never occur at any later time.

3) What does each sub-condition mean and what is its truth value under the above assumptions?
(I treat ""EventX happens"" as “EventX occurs at least once sometime.”)

- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens.""
  - Since event1 does happen (initially) but event2 can never happen (event1 prevents any later events), C1 is false.

- C2: ""C1 eventually holds.""
  - C1 is false now and can never become true (no event2 possible), so C2 is false.

- C3: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens.""
  - Same as C1, so C3 is false.

- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds.""
  - Both C2 and C3 are false, so C4 is false.

- C5: ""C4 eventually holds.""
  - C4 is false and can never become true, so C5 is false.

- C6: ""C5 always holds.""
  - C5 is false, so the universal claim that it ""always holds"" is false. Thus C6 is false.

- C7: ""C6 does not hold.""
  - Since C6 is false, the statement ""C6 does not hold"" is true. So C7 is True.

4) How the conditions relate to each other (summary)
- The initial event1 and the rule that event1 is terminal block event2 forever.
- Any condition that requires event2 (like C1/C3) is therefore false.
- All later conditions built from those (C2, C4, C5, C6) are false as a consequence.
- C7 is the negation of C6, so it is true.

If you intended a different temporal interpretation (for example, allowing event2 to have occurred before the initial moment, or treating ""event1 happens"" as “happens repeatedly” rather than “happens at least once”), tell me and I can re-evaluate under that interpretation.

- Initial condition: event2 happened (i.e., at the initial moment, event2 is true).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen. (If event1 occurs then event2 occurs afterward.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs then event1 occurs afterward.)
(These make event1 and event2 mutually implicative, but the important given is that event2 has already happened initially.)

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event2 does not happen.” (a claim that event2 is false.)
- C2: “Event2 does not happen.” (same claim again.)
- C3: “If C1 holds, then C2 holds.” (C1 ⇒ C2.)
- C4: “If C1 holds, then C2 holds.” (same as C3.)
- C5: “C3 holds and C4 holds.” (C3 ∧ C4.)

Step 4 — how they relate and final truth-values
- From the context, event2 did happen initially, so the proposition “Event2 does not happen” is false. Thus C1 = false and C2 = false.
- An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously true). Since C1 is false, the statements C1 ⇒ C2 (both C3 and C4) are true.
- Therefore C3 = true and C4 = true.
- Finally, C5 = C3 ∧ C4 = true ∧ true = True.

Answer: C5 is True.

Short answer: C7 is True (under the usual temporal / LTL convention that ""eventually"" includes the current moment). Below I show the step-by-step reasoning and note the one semantic caveat.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened at the initial moment (call that time 0).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- If event1 happens, then event2 must happen afterward (event1 → eventually event2).
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) What does each sub-condition (C1, C2, C3, etc.) mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — this is equivalent to ""event1 happens"" (redundant conjunction).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — equivalent to ¬(event1).
- C3: same as C1, i.e. event1 happens.
- C4: C2 ∧ C3 = (¬event1) ∧ (event1) — a contradiction, so C4 is false (never true).
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" — since C4 is always false, C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 holds or event2 happens"" = false ∨ (event2 happens) = ""event2 happens"".
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds"" — i.e. eventually (event2 happens).

4) How do these conditions relate to each other (and final evaluation)?
- From the initial condition, event2 already happened at time 0, so C6 is true at time 0.
- C7 asks whether C6 holds at some time ≥ now (""eventually C6""). Under the standard temporal-logic reading (LTL-style) ""eventually"" (F) is satisfied if the property holds now or at some future time. Therefore C7 is true because C6 holds now (due to the initial event2).
- Caveat: if you insist that ""eventually"" means strictly at some later time (excluding the current moment), then we must ask whether C6 will hold at any strictly later time. After event2 happened no further events can happen, and event2 does not reoccur later, so C6 would not hold later and C7 would be false under that stricter interpretation. But the common interpretation includes the present moment, so C7 is True.

Conclusion: C7 is True (assuming the usual ""eventually"" that allows the present instant).

Short answer: C6 is True (under the usual reading that ""eventually"" includes the current/initial moment). Below is the step-by-step breakdown you asked for.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened at the initial time (so at the initial state event1 is true).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (so once event1 has occurred, event2 will occur at some point afterwards).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: “Event1 eventually happens.” Given event1 already holds initially, C1 is true (there exists a time — the initial time — when event1 holds).
- C2: “Event1 happens and C1 holds.” Since event1 holds and C1 is true, C2 is true.
- C3: “Event1 eventually happens.” Same as C1, so C3 is true.
- C4: “C2 holds or C3 holds.” With C2 true and C3 true, C4 is true.
- C5: “Event1 happens and C1 holds.” Same as C2, so C5 is true.
- C6: “C4 holds and C5 holds.” With C4 true and C5 true, C6 is true.

4) How they relate / final evaluation
- C1 = True
- C2 = True
- C3 = True
- C4 = True (C2 ∨ C3)
- C5 = True
- C6 = True (C4 ∧ C5)

C6 is True.

Caveat: if you interpret “eventually” to require a strictly future moment (not including the present initial moment), then C1 and C3 might be false unless event1 also occurs again in the future. Under that stricter semantics, the truth values could change; under the usual inclusive semantics used in temporal reasoning, the answer above holds.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

(Assuming ""eventually"" includes the current/initial moment — since event1 holds initially, C1–C5 are true and thus C6 = C4 ∧ C5 is true. If ""eventually"" were required to be strictly future, the result could differ.)"

Answer: C6 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has occurred initially (at the start).

2) Transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, the trace has no further events).
- After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 occurs, then a later event1 must occur).

Given event1 already happened initially and no events can happen after it, there is no opportunity for event2 to occur at any time in the trace.

3) What each sub-condition means and its truth value:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" True (event2 cannot occur because after the initial event1 no events can happen).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" True (C1 holds immediately and therefore eventually).
- C3: same as C2. True.
- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds."" True (both are true).
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" False (C4 does hold).
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" True (since C5 is false, its negation is true).

4) How they relate: C1 ⇒ C2 and C3; C2 ∧ C3 ⇒ C4; C4 false-ness would make C5 true, but here C4 is true so C5 is false, hence C6 (¬C5) is true.

Final: C6 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition (given): event1 happened initially.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 follows event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen (trace ends after event2).
So the allowed behavior is: event1 occurs, then event2 occurs, then nothing else.

Step 3 — meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Given the initial condition, C1 is false (event1 does happen).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" This asserts that C1 is true in all states/traces. Because C1 is false, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C1 always holds."" (same as C2) — false.
- C4: ""Event1 does not happen."" (same as C1) — false.
- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" Since C3 is false (and C4 is false), C5 is false.
- C6: ""If C2 holds, then C5 holds."" This is a standard implication: C2 -> C5.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final answer about C6
- C2 is false in every model consistent with the context (because C1 is false). An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuous truth). Therefore C6 (C2 -> C5) is true in every model consistent with the given context.
- Conclusion: C6 is True (vacuously true, because C2 is false).

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially.
- Additional facts: both events are terminal — “after event2, no other events can happen” and “after event1, no other events can happen.” So from the initial state (event2 happened) event1 does not (and cannot) happen.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- There are no transitions after either event: once event1 happens nothing else can happen; once event2 happens nothing else can happen. Given event2 already happened initially, no further events (including event1) can occur.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event1 happens or event1 happens” — this is just the proposition P where P = “event1 happens” (the disjunction is redundant).
- C2: same as C1, i.e. P.
- C3: “If C1 holds, then C2 holds” — i.e. P → P, which is a tautology (always true).
- C4: “C3 always holds” — that asserts the tautology C3 is true (so C4 is true).
- C5: same as C1, i.e. P.
- C6: “If event1 happens, then C5 holds” — i.e. P → P, again a tautology (always true).
- C7: “C4 holds or C6 holds” — disjunction of the two statements above.

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
- From the initial conditions, P (= “event1 happens”) is false (event2 happened and prevents other events).
- Therefore:
  - C1 = P is false.
  - C2 = P is false.
  - C3 = P → P is true (implication with same antecedent and consequent is true).
  - C4 = “C3 always holds” is true (C3 is a tautology).
  - C5 = P is false.
  - C6 = P → P is true (vacuously/tautologically true).
  - C7 = C4 ∨ C6 = true ∨ true = true.

Conclusion: C7 is True. (Note: even independent of the initial event facts, C3 and C6 are tautologies, so C7 would be true as soon as C4 or C6 is asserted.)

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time  initial state (call it t0) event1 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen next. After event2, event1 must happen next.
- So the system produces an infinite alternating trace: t0: event1, t1: event2, t2: event1, t3: event2, ….

(Interpreting “after … must happen” as the usual next-state constraint; and “always”, “in the next state”, “eventually” as the usual temporal operators G, X, F.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event1 always happens” — G(event1): event1 holds at every state.
- C2: “Event2 happens and C1 holds” — event2 ∧ C1.
- C3: “C2 holds and event2 happens” — C2 ∧ event2 (redundant: requires C2 and event2).
- C4: “Event1 always happens” — same as C1 (G(event1)).
- C5: “If C3 holds, then C4 holds” — (C3 → C4). An implication.
- C6: “C5 holds in the next state” — X(C5).
- C7: “C6 eventually holds” — F(C6).

4) How they evaluate on the alternating trace
- C1 (G(event1)) is false: event1 is true only on every other state, not on the event2 states, so it does not hold at every state.
- C2 = event2 ∧ C1 is false because C1 is false (even though event2 does occur at some states).
- C3 = C2 ∧ event2 is false (C2 false).
- C4 is the same as C1, so false.
- C5 (C3 → C4) is true at every state because its antecedent C3 is false everywhere; a false antecedent makes the implication true (vacuous truth).
- C6 = X(C5) is true at a state whenever C5 holds in the immediate successor. Since C5 holds at every state, C6 holds at every state that has a successor (in our infinite trace it holds everywhere).
- C7 = F(C6) is true because C6 already holds immediately (indeed at the very next state), so C6 holds eventually (in fact immediately).

Therefore C7 is True.

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" means: whenever event2 occurs, event1 will (eventually) occur afterwards.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" means: whenever event1 occurs, event2 will (eventually) occur afterwards.
- Together, starting from the initial event1, these rules force an alternating sequence event1 → event2 → event1 → … (both events will occur repeatedly).

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" Formally p → p. This is a logical tautology (always true).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" Since C1 is true, the disjunction C1 ∨ event2 is true (true ∨ anything = true).
- C3: same as C1 (tautology, true).
- C4: same as C1 (tautology, true).
- C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" Both C3 and C4 are true, so C5 is true.
- C6: ""If event1 happens, then C5 holds."" C5 is true unconditionally, so the implication event1 → C5 is true.
- C7: ""C2 holds or C6 holds."" Both C2 and C6 are true, so C7 is true.

4) How they relate / final evaluation
- Many of the Ci are tautologies or immediate consequences of tautologies. That makes C2, C5, C6 all true, and therefore C7 (C2 ∨ C6) is true.

Note: This uses standard propositional/material-implication semantics (p → p is always true). Under that interpretation, C7 is unequivocally True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
C1 is the tautology p → p, so C1 is true. Then C2 = C1 ∨ event2 is true. C3 and C4 are tautologies so C5 is true, hence C6 (event1 → C5) is true. Therefore C7 = C2 ∨ C6 is true.

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e. at some later time after every event2 there will be an event1).
- After event1, event2 must happen (i.e. at some later time after every event1 there will be an event2).

Together these force an infinite alternating sequence: event2 (initial), then event1, then event2, then event1, … So both events occur repeatedly forever; in particular event2 will occur again after any point in time.

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — redundant; equivalent to the atomic statement ""event2 happens"" (call it E2).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — i.e. eventually E2 occurs (there exists some future time where E2 is true).
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — i.e. from every time point, eventually E2 will occur (for all times, C2 is true).
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" — negation of C3.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" — at some future time C3 will be false.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold"" — negation of C5 (so: it is never the case that C4 eventually holds).
- C7: ""C6 always holds"" — at all times C6 is true.

4) How they relate and truth values
- C1 (E2): true at the initial moment because event2 happened.
- C2 (""eventually E2""): true at the initial moment (and in fact true at every time) because of the alternating rule — after any event1 there is event2, so event2 will occur again.
- C3 (""always C2""): true. From any time point the alternation guarantees E2 will happen eventually, so C2 holds at every time.
- C4 (not C3): false, because C3 is true.
- C5 (eventually C4): false — C4 is never true, so it never eventually holds.
- C6 (not C5): true — since C5 is false, its negation is true.
- C7 (always C6): true — the falsity of C5 (hence the truth of C6) holds at every time, so C6 always holds.

Therefore C7 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (the system starts in a state where event2 occurred).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1 happens, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
Because the initial state already has event2 happened and event2 is terminal, no further events can occur from the initial state (in particular, event1 cannot occur).

Step 3 — meaning of each Ci
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" (i.e., event1 never occurs in the run)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (negation of C1 — equivalently: event1 does happen)
- C3: ""Event1 does not happen."" (same as C1)
- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds."" (i.e., (not C1) and C1)
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" (negation of C4)
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" (C5 is true at all times / in all future states)
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" (at some time in the future C6 is true)

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and truth values
- From the initial condition and rules: event1 cannot happen. Therefore C1 is True.
- C2 is the negation of C1, so C2 is False.
- C3 is the same as C1, so C3 is True.
- C4 is (C2 and C3) = (False and True) = False.
- C5 is the negation of C4, so C5 is True.
- C6 asserts that C5 always holds. Because the system is already in a terminal state (no further transitions) and C5 holds now, C5 holds in every reachable future state; therefore C6 is True.
- C7 asks whether C6 eventually holds. Since C6 already holds now, it certainly holds at some (indeed at the current) time in the future. Thus C7 is True.

Short answer: C7 is True (the implication holds vacuously because C5 is false). Below are the step-by-step answers and reasoning.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state (call it state 0), event1 happened.

(Assumption used below: “next state” means one time-step after the state where we evaluate a condition, and we evaluate all C* predicates starting at the initial state unless otherwise indicated.)

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event2 occurs at some state, event1 must occur in the next state.
- Rule B: After event1 occurs at some state, no other events can happen in subsequent states. (In particular, no event2 can occur after an occurrence of event1.)

Because event1 happened initially (state 0) and Rule B prevents any further events, there can be no occurrences of event2 at state 1 or any later state.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: “Event2 happens in the next state” (i.e., event2 at state1 when evaluated at state0).
- C2: same as C1 (redundant): event2 happens in the next state.
- C3: “C2 holds in the next state” — evaluated at state0 this means: at state1, C2 is true, i.e. at state1 event2 happens at state2.
- C4: C1 holds and C3 holds (C1 ∧ C3).
- C5: C4 holds and event1 happens (C4 ∧ event1).
- C6: “Event2 happens in the next state” (same as C1/C2).
- C7: “If C5 holds, then C6 holds” (C5 → C6).

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
Evaluate at the initial state (state0):
- From Rule B, since event1 happened at state0, no events can happen in state1 or later. So event2 does not occur in state1 (or any later state).
- Therefore C1 (event2 at next state) is false. C2 is false for the same reason.
- C3 says “C2 holds in the next state” — but at state1 C2 would assert that event2 occurs at state2, which is false because no events can occur after event1. So C3 is false.
- C4 = C1 ∧ C3 = false ∧ false = false.
- C5 = C4 ∧ event1 = false ∧ true = false (event1 is true at the initial state, but C4 is false).
- C6 is the same as C1, so false.
- C7 is the implication C5 → C6. In classical logic an implication with a false antecedent is true, so C7 is true (vacuously true).

Conclusion: C7 is True (because C5 is false, making the implication true).

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules / temporal constraints
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Since event1 already happened initially, no further events can occur at any later time. In particular, event2 cannot occur after the initial event1.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" This says if event2 occurs then event1 must occur thereafter. But because event1 already occurred initially and no events can happen after it, there is no opportunity for event2 to occur at any time. So event2 cannot occur at all.

(Implicit assumption used: ""After event1, no other events can happen"" applies from the point event1 occurred onward, and since event1 occurred initially, it blocks any later occurrence of event2.)

Step 3 — meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (i.e., ¬(event2 occurs))
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (i.e., ¬C1)
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" (i.e., C2 is true at all relevant times — effectively C2)
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" (i.e., ¬C3)
- C5: ""C1 does not hold."" (same content as C2: ¬C1)
- C6: ""C4 holds or C5 holds."" (i.e., C4 ∨ C5)

Step 4 — evaluate the conditions
- From Step 2 we concluded event2 cannot happen, so C1 is True.
- C2 = ¬C1 = False.
- C3 = ""C2 always holds"" = False (because C2 is false).
- C4 = ¬C3 = True.
- C5 = ¬C1 = False (same as C2).
- C6 = C4 ∨ C5 = True ∨ False = True.

Reasoning (concise):

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition (given): initially event1 happened.
- Assumption used below: event2 did not happen initially (the statement only says event1 happened initially). Also assume standard linear-time semantics where ""in the next state"" (X) is false if there is no next state (i.e., the state after a terminal event does not satisfy X-formulas).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1 happens, no other events can happen at later times (so the system is terminal after event1).
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen at later times (the system would also be terminal after event2).
- In particular, because event1 occurs initially and it forbids any later events, event2 cannot occur at any later time (and we assume it did not occur simultaneously initially).

3) What does each sub-condition mean? (informal reading)
- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" (globally/eventually at every time — here read as: at every time point event2 is true).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens"" (a disjunction: either event2 always happens, or event1 happens now).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" (X C2).
- C4: ""C3 holds and event1 happens"" (C3 ∧ event1).
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" (X C4).
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds"" (F C5).
- C7: ""C6 always holds"" (G C6).

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values here?
- C1: False. Because event1 happens initially and after event1 no further events can occur, event2 never happens anywhere — so ""event2 always happens"" is false.
- C2: True at the initial state. C2 = (C1 ∨ event1). We have event1 true initially, so C2 is true initially despite C1 being false.
- C3: False. C3 asserts C2 in the next state. But the next state (if any) is after event1, and after event1 no events happen: event1 is false there, and C1 is false globally, so C2 is false in that next state. Hence C3 is false at the initial state.
- C4: False. C4 = (C3 ∧ event1). Since C3 is false, C4 is false.
- C5: False. C5 is ""C4 holds in the next state""; C4 is already false and remains false in subsequent (terminal) states, so C5 is false.
- C6: False. C6 is ""eventually C5"". If C5 never becomes true, C6 is false.
- C7: False. C7 = ""always C6"". Since C6 is false (already at the initial state), it cannot be the case that C6 always holds.

Therefore C7 is False.

(Notes: if one changed the reading of ""initially"" to mean both event1 and event2 occurred simultaneously initially, or adopted nonstandard semantics for terminal states, some truth values could change. Under the natural reading above, C7 is false.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event1 occurs initially and makes the run terminal, so event2 never holds (C1 false). That makes C3 false in the next state, hence C4/C5 never hold, so C6 (F C5) is false and therefore C7 (G C6) is false."

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) What events are involved and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 (E1) and event2 (E2).
- Initial condition: initially E1 happened (E1 is true at the start).
- Temporal constraint: after E1, no other events can happen. Since E1 already happened initially, no events can happen after that time — in particular, E2 cannot happen at any later time.

2) Transition rules between events
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" means: if E2 occurs then (eventually) E1 must occur afterward. Formally: E2 → (eventually) E1.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means: once E1 has occurred, no further events (including E2) can occur after that time. Because E1 occurred initially, there is no time left for E2 to occur. So under the given context E2 is impossible.

3) What each sub-condition means (and truth values)
I'll denote truth values under the given context (E1 true initially, E2 cannot happen so E2 is false).

- C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" = ¬E2. Given E2 cannot happen, C1 is True.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" = ¬C1. Since C1 is True, C2 is False.
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds"" = (E2 → C2). An implication with a false antecedent (E2 is false) is vacuously True, so C3 is True.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" — C3 already holds, so C4 is True.
- C5: ""If event2 happens, then C4 holds"" = (E2 → C4). Since E2 is false (antecedent false), this implication is vacuously True, so C5 is True.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold"" = ¬C5. Because C5 is True, C6 is False.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold"" = ¬C6. Since C6 is False, ¬C6 is True. So C7 is True.

4) How the conditions relate to each other (summary)
- The initial facts force ¬E2 (so C1 true).
- That makes C2 false.
- Implications with false antecedents (those of the form E2 → ...) are vacuously true, so C3 and C5 are true, hence C4 is true.
- Therefore C5 is true, so C6 (¬C5) is false, and C7 (¬C6) is true.

Conclusion: C7 is True.

True.

Reason: let e2 be ""event2 occurs at the current state"". Then
- C1 = C2 = F e2.
- C3 = F(C2) = F(F e2) = F e2.
- C4 = ¬C3 = ¬F e2.
- C5 = X C4 = X(¬F e2).
- C6 = (F e2) -> X(¬F e2).
- C7 = G(C6).

Given the system trace: at time 0 e2 is true (initially event2 happened), at time 1 event1 occurs and thereafter no events occur, so e2 is false at time 1 and all later times. Thus:
- At time 0 F e2 is true (e2 already happened), and X(¬F e2) is true because at time 1 ¬F e2 holds. So C6 holds at time 0.
- At time 1 F e2 is false, so C6 holds vacuously at time 1.
There are no other states, so C6 holds at every state; hence C7 (always C6) is True."

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time 0, event1 happened.

2) Transition rules
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"": if event2 occurs at some time t, then event1 must occur at the next time (or at least at some following time). For our reasoning it suffices that event2 forces a later event1.
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"": event1 is terminal — once event1 has occurred, no further events (neither event1 nor event2) can occur afterwards.

Because event1 already happened initially (time 0) and it is terminal, no events can happen at any later time. In particular, event2 never occurs at any time.

3) Meaning of the Ci
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" — This is false, because event2 never happens.
- C2: same as C1 — false.
- C3: C1 and C2 — false AND false = false.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens."" — This is an implication (C3 → event2). Since C3 is false, the implication is vacuously true.
- C5: ""If event2 happens, then C4 holds."" — This is (event2 → C4). Event2 never happens, so this implication is also vacuously true.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" — Evaluate at time 0: at time 1, event2 does not happen, so C5 is true at time 1; hence C6 is true at time 0.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" — Since C6 already holds at time 0, C7 is true.

4) How they relate (summary)
- Because event1 is initially true and blocks any future events, event2 never occurs, making C1–C3 false.
- The implications C4 and C5 are vacuously true because their antecedents are false (C3 false for C4; event2 false for C5).
- That makes C5 true in the next state, so C6 is true, and therefore C7 (""eventually C6"") is true.

Short answer: C6 is True.

Now the step-by-step reasoning and assumptions.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened in the initial state.
- Additional facts: after event1 no other events can happen; after event2 no other events can happen. So any state in which event1 or event2 occurs is a terminal state (it has no successor).

2) Transition rules between events
- From the initial state (where event2 has happened) there are no successor states, because ""after event2 no other events can happen.""
- Similarly, any state with event1 would also be terminal. So the only reachable state here is the initial state; there is no ""next"" state.

(Implicit semantic assumption: we use the usual linear temporal semantics where
- □φ (""always φ"") means φ holds in the current and all future states along the path,
- Xφ (""next φ"") requires a successor state and is false at a state with no successor.)

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" = □(event2). In our single-state trace this holds iff event2 holds in the initial state and all future states. Event2 does hold in the initial state and there are no future states, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" = X(C1). This requires a successor state. There is no next state, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" = □(C2). Since C2 is false in the current state, C3 is false.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens"" = (C3 → event2). An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C4 is true (because C3 is false).
- C5: ""C1 holds in the next state"" = X(C1). This is the same as C2, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C4 holds or C5 holds"" = C4 ∨ C5. With C4 = true and C5 = false, C6 = true.

4) How the conditions relate and final answer
- C1 is true because event2 is true in the only state.
- C2 and C5 are false because there is no next state.
- C3 is false, which makes C4 vacuously true.
- Therefore C6 = C4 ∨ C5 = True ∨ False = True.

Note on semantics: if you interpreted Xφ as vacuously true at terminal states (instead of false), or used a different temporal logic semantics, answers for C2/C5 (and thus C3/C4/C6) could differ. The reasoning above uses the standard convention that ""next"" is false when there is no successor.

Short answer: C6 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (initially).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen (so because event1 happened initially, event2 will happen at some point).
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal — nothing happens after it).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (This asserts event2 never occurs.)
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" (Conditional: if event2 does not happen, then event2 happens.)
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" (C2 is true/holds.)
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" (Same as C2.)
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" (If C2 is true, then the conditional C4 is true.)
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" (At some time in the future, C5 holds.)

4) How do these conditions relate and what is the truth value of C6?
- From the rules, event1 has happened and therefore event2 must happen. So C1 (""event2 does not happen"") is false.
- C2 and C4 are conditionals with a false antecedent (C1). In classical logic an implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true, so both C2 and C4 are true.
- C3 says C2 always holds; since C2 is true in the situation, C3 holds.
- C5 is ""if C3 then C4"". With C3 true and C4 true, C5 holds.
- C6 says C5 eventually holds. Because C5 already holds now, it certainly holds at some (the current) time — so C6 is true.

Therefore C6 is True.

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (i.e., at the initial moment event1 has occurred).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur sometime after event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen (the sequence stops after event2).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Given the initial condition, this is true.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" This is a disjunction. Since C1 is true, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This is the negation of C2. Since C2 is true, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" This requires C3 to be true at all times. C3 is false (at least initially), so C4 is false.
- C5: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Same as C1, so true.
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" Conjunction of false (C4) and true (C5) → C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" Negation of C6. Since C6 is false, C7 is true.

Reasoning (concise):
- From the context ""After event1, event2 must happen"" we take C1 (event1 → event2) to hold globally.
- If C1 holds, then C2 (C1 ∨ event1) is immediately true.
- If C2 is true now, C3 (eventually C2) holds (trivially, since C2 already holds), and hence C4 (always C3) holds as well.
- If C4 holds globally, then C5 (C4 holds in the next state) is true now. The context also states that event2 happened initially, so C6 (C5 ∧ event2) holds now.
- Since C6 holds now, C7 (eventually C6) is true.

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (so once event2 occurs, event1 will occur afterwards).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so they force each other and will alternate).

3) Meaning of each sub-condition and evaluation
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True — it already happened initially.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Given the transition rule ""after event2, event1 must happen,"" whenever event2 happens (i.e. whenever C1 holds) event1 will happen. So C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" C2 expresses a general implication that follows from the system rule, so C2 holds at all times; therefore C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Since C3 already holds, C4 is true.
- C5: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Same as C1, true (initial event2 and the alternating behavior guarantee repeated occurrences).
- C6: ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds."" The antecedent C4 is true and the consequent C5 is true, so the implication C6 is true.
- C7: ""Event1 happens or C6 holds."" We already established event1 does happen (because event2 happened and the rule forces event1), and C6 also holds. So the disjunction is true.

4) How they relate
- The initial event2 (C1/C5) triggers event1 (C2), and those rules hold always (C3), so all later statements that depend on those facts (C4, C6) are true. That yields C7 true by either disjunct (event1) or by C6.

Answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened in the initial state.

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"": the state reached after event1 is terminal — there are no successor states and no further events.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"": if event2 ever occurs, that state would also be terminal.
- Because event1 already happened initially and that state is terminal, event2 cannot occur at any later time.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions (using standard linear-time temporal operators)
- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" (□(event2) or simply: event2 holds now and at every future state).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" (X C1).
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens"" (X C1 ∧ event2).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" (◇C3).
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" (X C4).
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state"" (X X C4).
- C7: ""C6 does not hold"" (¬C6).

(Also note: in standard semantics X φ is false in a state with no successor; ◇φ is false if there is no future state where φ holds.)

4) Evaluate the conditions
- C1 is false: event2 does not hold now (initially event1 happened), and there will be no future state with event2, so ""event2 always happens"" fails immediately.
- C2 (X C1) is false because there is no next state (the initial state after event1 is terminal), and X of anything is false when there is no successor.
- C3 (X C1 ∧ event2) is false (both conjuncts false).
- C4 (◇C3) is false: there is no future state where C3 can hold.
- C5 (X C4) is false (no successor).
- C6 (X X C4) is false (still no successors).
- C7 (¬C6) is therefore true because C6 is false.

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen. (Whenever event1 occurs, a subsequent event2 occurs.)
- After event2, event1 must happen. (Whenever event2 occurs, a subsequent event1 occurs.)
- Together these imply that once one has occurred, the other must occur next, so both events occur (and in fact they alternate from the initial event2).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: event1 happens AND event2 happens. (Both occur.)
- C2: event1 happens AND event2 happens. (Same as C1.)
- C3: event1 happens AND event2 happens. (Same as C1 and C2.)
- C4: If C2 holds then C3 holds. Since C2 and C3 are identical propositions, C4 is true (it is the implication P → P).
- C5: C4 eventually holds. (""Eventually"" means at some time C4 is true.) Because C4 is true now (and will remain true), C5 is true.
- C6: C5 does not hold. This is the negation of C5, so C6 is false.
- C7: If C1 holds then C6 holds. This is the implication C1 → C6.

4) How do these conditions relate and what follows?
- From the initial event2 and the transition rules, event1 will happen (after event2), and then event2 will happen again, etc. So event1 and event2 both occur; thus C1, C2, C3 are true.
- Since C2 and C3 are true, C4 is true. Hence C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true. Therefore C6 (""C5 does not hold"") is false.
- C7 asserts that C1 implies C6. But C1 is true while C6 is false, so the implication C1 → C6 is false.

Short answer: C7 is True (vacuously true). Below is the step-by-step reasoning you requested.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially (in the initial state) event1 happened.
- Additional facts: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" Also ""After event2, no other events can happen."" The important one is the first: because event1 already happened initially, no other events can happen at any later state.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- From the given statements: once event1 occurs, the system does not allow any further events. Similarly, if event2 ever occurs then no further events occur after that — but event2 never actually occurs here because event1 already occurred initially.
- So in this scenario, there are no future states in which any event (including event2) happens. In particular, event2 does not happen in the next state or any later state.

3) What does each sub-condition mean (informally) and what are their truth values now?
Interpreting the Ci informally in usual temporal-language style:
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" — False, because no events happen after the initial event1.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (i.e. in the next state it is true that event2 happens in that state's next state) — False, since C1 is false everywhere.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" (i.e. C2 holds in all future states) — False, because C2 is already false now.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" — False (same reasoning).
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" — False.
- C6: same as C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" — False.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other, and is C7 true?
- C7: ""If C5 holds, then C6 holds."" This is a material implication. Since C5 is false in the current state, the implication ""C5 → C6"" is true (a false antecedent makes the implication true). This is the usual vacuous-truth situation.
- Thus C7 is True.

Summary: Because event1 happened initially and no events can happen afterward, any claim that event2 happens in the next state (or nested/always versions of that claim) is false. However the conditional ""if C5 then C6"" is true because its antecedent C5 is false. Hence C7 is True.

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially, event1 happened (so at the start event1 has occurred).
- After event1, no other events can happen (once event1 has happened, the system is terminal — no further events).
- After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 ever occurs, event1 must occur afterward).

Given that event1 has already happened initially and no events can happen after it, event2 can never happen.

2) Transition rules between events
- event1 occurs at the initial time and blocks any subsequent events.
- The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 never occurs (it cannot occur after the initial event1).

3) Meaning of each Ci
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" — False (event2 cannot happen).
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" — True. Either way: if event2 happens then “event2 eventually happens” is true; if event2 does not happen the implication is true vacuously. So C2 is true.
- C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" — True, because C2 holds.
- C4: ""Event2 eventually happens."" — Same as C1, False.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" — This is C3 → C4. Since C3 is true and C4 is false, C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" — True, because C5 is false.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" — True (see next step).

4) How the conditions relate and final conclusion
- C2 being true makes C3 true immediately.
- C3 true while C4 false makes the implication C5 false.
- Therefore C6 (""C5 does not hold"") is true.
- Nothing in the system can change over time (no further events can occur after the initial event1), so the truth values are stable; C6 holds at all times. Hence C7 (""C6 always holds"") is True.

Reasoning (concise):
- Timeline: t0 = initial: event2. By the rules, events alternate: t1 = event1, t2 = event2, t3 = event1, ...
- Evaluate at t0:
  - C1 (event2 at next state) is false (t1 is event1).
  - C2 (C1 holds in next state) is true because at t1, C1 is true (t2 is event2).
  - C3 = C2 and event2 at t0 → true (event2 at t0).
  - C4 = C3 or event2 → true.
  - C5 (event2 at next state) is false (same as C1 at t0).
  - C6 = (C4 → C5) is false at t0 (true → false).
- At t1:

- Initially event1 happens.
- From ""after event1, event2 must happen"" we get event2 happens.
- Thus C1 (event2) holds.
- From ""after event2, event1 must happen"" and C1 we get event1 happens, so C2 and C3 hold.

- C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true since C4 already holds.

Short answer: C6 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened in the initial state (call it s0).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: ""After event1, event2 must happen."" (If event1 occurs, event2 must occur afterward.)
- Rule B: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" (Once event2 occurs, no further events can occur in any later state.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" (i.e. event2 occurs at s1).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (there exists some future state where C1 is true).
- C3: same as C2 (a duplicate).
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" (C3 is true at s1).
- C5: ""C2 holds and C4 holds"".
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state"" (C5 is true at s1).

4) How they relate and evaluation
- At s0 we already have event2. By Rule B, after event2 no other events can happen in any later state. In particular, s1 and all subsequent states have no events.
- Therefore C1 (""event2 happens in the next state"") is false (event2 does not occur at s1).
- C2 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false because C1 never becomes true in any future state.
- C3 is the same as C2, so C3 is false.
- C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is false because C3 is false at s1.
- C5 (C2 and C4) is false (both conjuncts are false).
- C6 (""C5 holds in the next state"") is false because C5 is false at s1.

Conclusion: C6 is False.

Short answer: C6 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event2 and event1.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, event1 must happen (so given the initial event2, event1 will occur).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) What does each sub-condition mean (interpreting ""always happens"" as “inevitably happens in any run given the initial condition”):
- C1: Event1 always happens — given the initial event2 and the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"", C1 is true: event1 will occur.
- C2: C1 does not hold — the negation of C1, so C2 is false.
- C3: C2 holds or event1 happens — this is a disjunction. Since event1 does happen, C3 is true (regardless of C2).
- C4: C3 eventually holds — since C3 already holds (event1 happens), C4 is true.
- C5: C1 does not hold — same as C2, false.
- C6: C4 holds and C5 holds — conjunction of true (C4) and false (C5), so C6 is false.

4) How the conditions relate
- C1 true ⇒ C2 and C5 false.
- C3 is true because event1 occurs regardless of C2.
- C4 true because C3 is true at some point.
- C6 = C4 ∧ C5 = true ∧ false = false.

Therefore C6 is False. (If you intended a different technical meaning of ""always happens"" — e.g., ""happens at every moment"" rather than ""necessarily occurs"" — let me know and I can re-evaluate.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: event2 forces event1, so C1 is true; hence C5 (C1 does not hold) is false, and C6 = C4 ∧ C5 is false."

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (at the start).

From the context we also know: after event1, event2 must happen; after event2 nothing else can happen.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Because event1 happened initially, event2 will (must) happen afterwards (at some later point).
- After event2 occurs, the run ends (no further events occur).

So a representative timeline is:
- time t0: event1 occurs.
- some later time t1 ≥ t0: event2 occurs.
- for all t > t1: no events.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a logical tautology (p → p). It is true at every time (in particular true at t0 where event1 does happen).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is a tautology, C1 holds at every time, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" If a property holds always, then it certainly holds at some time in the future — so C3 is true (in fact C2 holds now and forever).
- C4: ""C3 holds and event2 happens."" We have C3 true and event2 does happen (at t1), so C4 is true (true at times where we evaluate both conjuncts; at least at times after event2 has happened).
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" This requires C4 to be true at every time. But C4 contains ""event2 happens"" as a conjunct; event2 only happens at a particular time (t1), not at every time. Therefore C4 is not true at all times, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" Since C5 is false, C6 (¬C5) is true.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" C6 is already true (immediately), so it certainly holds at some time — therefore C7 is true.

4) How the conditions relate to each other (summary chain)
- C1 is a tautology → makes C2 true.
- C2 true → makes C3 true.
- C3 true and event2 occurs → C4 true.
- C4 is not invariant (because event2 is not always true) → C5 false.
- C5 false → C6 true.
- C6 true → C7 true (eventually and even always).

Conclusion: C7 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: C5 (""C4 always holds"") is false because C4 requires ""event2 happens"" which is true only at the single time event2 occurs, not at every time. Hence C6 = ¬C5 is true immediately, so C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is true."

Answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially.
- Additional facts: after event1 no other events can happen; after event2 no other events can happen. So once either event occurs, no further events occur. Given the initial fact that event1 happened, no other events (including event2) can ever happen.

2) Transition rules between events?
- Both rules are the same form: occurrence of event1 (or event2) blocks any future events. There is no rule allowing any event after event1, and because event1 already occurred initially, nothing else can occur afterwards (in particular event2 cannot occur).

3) Meaning / evaluation of each sub-condition:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" True, because event1 already happened and that prevents any later events.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" True, because event1 did happen (and also C1 holds).
- C3: ""Event2 does not happen."" Same as C1, True.
- C4: ""Event2 does not happen."" Same, True.
- C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" True, since C3 and C4 are true.
- C6: ""C2 holds or C5 holds."" True, since C2 and C5 are true.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" Because C6 is a proposition that is true given the stated facts (event1 happened and event2 never happens), C6 remains true at all times; therefore C7 is True.

4) How they relate:
- C1/C3/C4 are the same factual claim (event2 never happens). Those make C5 true. C2 is also true independently because event1 happened. Thus C6 (C2 or C5) is true, and since these are facts fixed by the initial conditions and rules, C6 holds at every point — so C7 (""C6 always holds"") is True.

(If you interpret ""always"" temporally: even after the initial instant, C2 remains true because C1 remains true; hence C6 remains true at all times.)

Short answer: C6 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened at the start.

2) Transition rules between events
- After any occurrence of event1, event2 must occur next.
- After any occurrence of event2, event1 must occur next.
- Thus the system produces an alternating sequence: event1 (initial), then event2, then event1, then event2, … — so event1 does occur (it already occurred initially and recurs).

3) What each sub-condition means (interpreting C1 as “event1 does not happen” in the obvious sense)
- C1: “Event1 does not happen.” Given the initial event1, C1 is false.
- C2: “C1 does not hold” (i.e. C1 is false). Since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- C3: “C2 eventually holds.” C2 already holds now, so C3 is true (a property that holds now also satisfies “eventually”).
- C4: “C1 does not hold.” This is the same as C2, so C4 is true.
- C5: “If C3 holds, then C4 holds.” Since C3 is true and C4 is true, the implication C5 is true.
- C6: “C5 eventually holds.” C5 holds now, so C6 is true.

4) How they relate
- C1 is false because event1 occurred.
- C2 and C4 assert C1 is false — they are true.
- C3 says that C2 will hold at some time; because C2 already holds, C3 is true.
- C5 is the implication (C3 → C4); both antecedent and consequent are true, so C5 is true.
- C6 says C5 will hold at some time; since C5 holds now (and will continue), C6 is true.

Notes/assumptions:
- I treated “eventually” as satisfied if the property holds now (standard LTL semantics: F p is true if p holds at some current or future position). Even under a stricter reading (requiring a strictly later moment), the alternating behavior guarantees these facts continue to hold, so the conclusions are the same.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason (brief): event1 occurs initially, so C1 is false and C2 (=not C1) is true. Hence C3 (eventually C2) is true, C4 (=C2) is true, so C5 (C3 → C4) is true, and therefore C6 (eventually C5) is true."

True.

Reason (concise):
- From the rules and the initial fact (event1 at the start) the system forces an infinite alternation of event1 and event2 (whether ""after"" means next-state or eventually, each event will keep occurring repeatedly).
- C1 = (event2 ∧ event1) is false (they do not hold in the same state under alternation).
- C2 = event2 ∨ C1 simplifies to event2.
- C3 = X C2 = X event2.
- C4 = F C3 = F (X event2) is true everywhere because event2 occurs infinitely often, so there is always some future state whose next state has event2.
- Therefore C5 = X C4 is true everywhere, C6 = F C5 is true everywhere, and finally C7 = G C6 is true.

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened.  
- Also given: “after event1, no other events can happen” and “after event2, no other events can happen.” So any state in which event1 or event2 has just happened is terminal (no outgoing transitions).

Step 2 — transition rules
- If event1 occurs, the run stops there (no next state).
- If event2 occurs, the run stops there (no next state).
- Since event1 happened initially, the initial state is a terminal state and there is no next state.

Step 3 — what each C means (reading “in the next state” as the standard next-time operator)
- C1: “Event1 does not happen” — evaluated in the current (initial) state.
- C2: same as C1 (same formula).
- C3: “C2 holds in the next state” — i.e. in the successor state C2 is true.
- C4: “C3 does not hold” — negation of C3.
- C5: “C1 holds and C4 holds” — conjunction.
- C6: “C5 holds in the next state.”
- C7: “C6 does not hold” — negation of C6.

Step 4 — truth-value evaluation given the model
- C1: false. The initial state has event1, so “event1 does not happen” is false.
- C2: false (same as C1).
- C3: false. C3 asserts something about the next state, but there is no next state (terminal), so a “next” assertion is false under the usual semantics.
- C4: true. It is the negation of C3, so true.
- C5: false. It conjuncts C1 (false) with C4 (true) → overall false.
- C6: false. It asserts C5 in the next state; there is no next state, so it is false.
- C7: true. It is the negation of C6, and C6 is false, so C7 is true.

Conclusion
- C7 is True.

Note: this conclusion uses the standard semantics where a next-time assertion is false in a terminal state (i.e., there is no next state). If you use a different semantics for “next” (e.g., treating next-of-terminal as vacuously true), the evaluation could differ — but under the usual interpretation above, C7 is true.

Short answer: C7 is True (given the usual interpretation below).

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state s0, event1 happened (event1 is true at s0).

I assume a standard linear discrete timeline of states s0, s1, s2, ... and that “initially” refers to s0. I also assume the system continues (so there is a next state s1, etc.).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen: if event1 is true at some state, then event2 is true at the next state.
- After event2, event1 must happen: if event2 is true at some state, then event1 is true at the next state.

From these rules and event1 true at s0 we get the infinite alternation:
- s0: event1 true, event2 false
- s1: event2 true, event1 false
- s2: event1 true, event2 false
- s3: event2 true, ...
and so on.

3) What does each sub-condition mean? (Interpretation at the initial state s0)
- C1: “Event2 happens and event2 happens” — this is just event2 (redundant conjunction). At s0, event2 is false, so C1 is false at s0.
- C2: same as C1, also false at s0.
- C3: C2 holds and event1 happens. Since C2 is false at s0, C3 is false at s0 (false ∧ true = false).
- C4: “If C3 holds, then event2 happens.” This is an implication. At s0 C3 is false, so the implication is vacuously true; thus C4 is true at s0.
- C5: “C4 holds in the next state.” This means evaluate C4 at s1. We must check C4 at s1:
  - At s1, event2 is true, so C2 (event2) is true at s1.
  - C3 = C2 ∧ event1 at s1 is true ∧ false = false.
  - Therefore at s1, C3 is false, so C4 (“if C3 then event2”) is again vacuously true at s1.
  - Hence C5 is true at s0 (because C4 does hold at s1).
- C6: “C5 holds or event1 happens.” At s0, C5 is true (see above) and event1 is also true, so C6 is true at s0.
- C7: “C1 holds or C6 holds.” At s0, C1 is false but C6 is true, so C7 is true at s0.

4) How do these conditions relate and final conclusion?
- Because event1 at s0 forces event2 at s1 and so on, C2/C1 are false at s0 but true at s1. The implication C4 is true everywhere because its antecedent C3 is always false in every state (C3 requires both event2 and event1 in the same state, which never happens under alternation). C5 therefore holds at s0 (C4 true at s1). C6 is true (C5 ∨ event1), so C7 = C1 ∨ C6 is true.

Final answer: C7 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (it has occurred at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (so because event2 happened initially, event1 will happen).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal: once it occurs nothing else occurs afterward).

Step 3 — meanings of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" (equivalently: event1 happens)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (negation of C1)
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" (negation of C2)
- C4: ""C3 holds and event2 happens."" (conjunction of C3 and event2)
- C5: ""C1 does not hold."" (same as C2)
- C6: ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds."" (implication C4 ⇒ C5)

Step 4 — truth evaluation and relations
- From the rules: event2 happened initially, and therefore event1 must happen. So event1 happens.
- C1: true (event1 happens).
- C2: false (C1 is true, so its negation is false).
- C3: true (negation of false).
- C4: true (C3 is true AND event2 happened initially).
- C5: false (same as C2).
- C6: evaluates the implication C4 ⇒ C5. Here antecedent C4 is true and consequent C5 is false, so the implication is false.

Short answer: C6 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happens at the initial state.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen next.
- After event2, event1 must happen next.
- Therefore the system produces the infinite alternating sequence: event1, event2, event1, event2, ... . In particular, at every state at least one of {event1,event2} holds.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" Given the transition rules and the initial event1, C1 is true in every state (the sequence consists only of event1 or event2).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is the negation of C1, so C2 is false (everywhere).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" Since C2 is false now and in every state, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" C3 is false, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C1 does not hold."" Same as C2, so C5 is false.

4) How they relate and evaluation of C6
- C6 is ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds."" In propositional logic this is (C4 → C5), which is equivalent to (not C4) or C5.
- We determined C4 is false. A material implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuous truth). Hence C4 → C5 is true regardless of C5's value.
- Therefore C6 is True.

Note: this conclusion assumes the given transition rules are strict (the system always alternates and never has a state with neither event). If you allowed states where neither event happens, C1 might be false in some states and the evaluation would change; under the given context, however, C6 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: C4 is false (C3 does not hold), and a material implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuous truth), so C4 → C5 is true."

Answer: C6 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition (given): event1 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 happens).
- After event2, no other events can happen (no further events after event2).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" (negation of the given initial fact.)
- C2: ""Event1 does not happen."" (same as C1; redundant.)
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" (implication: C2 → event2.)
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" (implication: C1 → C3.)
- C5: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" (same as C3; redundant.)
- C6: ""C4 holds or C5 holds."" (C4 ∨ C5.)

(I'm using standard material implication: an implication with a false antecedent is true.)

4) How the conditions relate and final truth values
- Because the context states event1 happened, C1 and C2 (""event1 does not happen"") are false.
- An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuous truth), so:
  - C3 (C2 → event2) is true (antecedent C2 is false).
  - C5 is the same as C3, so true.
  - C4 (C1 → C3) is true (antecedent C1 is false).
- Therefore C6 = C4 ∨ C5 is true (indeed both disjuncts are true).

Note: If you treat ""if ... then ..."" as a stronger causal/temporal claim rather than material implication, the evaluation may change; under the usual logic reading above, C6 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: event1 happened, so C1 and C2 are false. Under standard material implication, any implication with a false antecedent is true, so C3 and C5 (C2 → event2) and C4 (C1 → C3) are all true. Hence C6 = C4 ∨ C5 is true."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (so event2 is true at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- “After event1, event2 must happen” means logically: event1 → event2.
- “After event2, no other events can happen” means once event2 has happened, no further events occur (in particular, no later event1). For the truth-value reasoning below we only need that event2 is true initially.

Step 3 — meaning of each Ci (in logical form)
- C1: event1 → event2.
- C2: event1 → event2. (same as C1)
- C3: C2 always holds. Interpreted as: C2 is true.
- C4: If C1 holds, then C3 holds. (C1 → C3)
- C5: C4 holds or event2 happens. (C4 ∨ event2)
- C6: C5 does not hold. (¬(C4 ∨ event2) ≡ ¬C4 ∧ ¬event2)
- C7: C6 holds or event2 happens. (C6 ∨ event2)

Step 4 — how they relate and final evaluation
- From the initial condition we have event2 = True.
- Evaluate C5 = C4 ∨ event2. Since event2 is True, C5 is True (regardless of C4).
- C6 = ¬C5, so C6 is False.
- C7 = C6 ∨ event2 = False ∨ True = True.

Short answer: C5 is False under the natural reading that ""after event2 no other events can happen"" means the system is terminal after event2. (If you instead interpret ""no other events"" as ""no events other than event2"" — i.e. event2 may repeat — then C5 would be True. See below.)

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state event2 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs, the next state must have event2).
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen. (I take this to mean that once event2 has occurred, no events occur in any subsequent state — the run is terminal after event2.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" (redundant conjunction; C1 is simply the proposition that event2 happens in that state).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (the next state must satisfy C1, i.e. the next state must have event2).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" (two steps forward: the state two steps from now must make C2 true).
- C4: ""C2 holds in the next state."" (same as C3; probably intended to be the same two-step claim).
- C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" (logical OR of the two two-step claims).

4) How do these conditions relate and what's the truth value of C5?
- In the initial state event2 holds, so C1 is true in the initial state.
- By Rule B, after event2 no events occur in later states, so the immediate next state does not have event2. Therefore C1 is false in the next state, so C2 is false.
- Since C2 is false in the next state, any further ""C2 holds in the next state"" claims (C3 and C4) are false as well.
- Therefore C5 = (C3 or C4) = False or False = False.

Note on ambiguity: if Rule B were read as ""after event2, no events other than event2 can happen"" (i.e. event2 can occur again but event1 cannot), then the next state could again have event2, making C1 true there, so C2 true, and then C3/C4 true, so C5 would be True. The answer above assumes the more usual reading that event2 is terminal.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially, event2 happened.
- Both events are terminal: after event2 no other events can happen; after event1 no other events can happen.

Step 2 — transition rules
- Because event2 already happened initially and no events can occur after event2, there is no further event in the next state.
- Similarly, if event1 happens, nothing can happen afterwards. So no new events can follow either terminal event.

Step 3 — meaning and truth of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
  - False. Event2 happened initially and no events can occur afterward, so it does not happen in the next state.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" (C1 → event1)
  - True. An implication with a false antecedent (C1 is false) is vacuously true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold.""
  - False, because C2 is true.
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens.""
  - True. (Same as C2.)
- C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" (C3 ∨ C4)
  - True, because C4 is true (C3 is false).
- C6: ""Event2 happens and C5 holds."" (event2 ∧ C5)
  - True. Event2 did happen initially, and C5 is true, so their conjunction is true.

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- C1 is false, which makes C2 and C4 vacuously true.
- C3 is the negation of C2, so C3 is false.
- C5 is true because C4 is true.
- Since event2 happened initially and C5 is true, C6 is true.

Reason (succinct):

- C1 and C2 (""event1 eventually happens"") are true at the initial state because event1 has happened initially.
- C3 = F C2 and C4 = F C3 are also true at the initial state, since C2 and C3 hold already at the initial state (F includes the current state).
- But after the initial state no events happen, so in the next state C2, C3 and C4 are all false (event1 will not happen in the future of that state).
- C5 = X C4 requires C4 to hold in the next state; it does not, so C5 is false. Hence C6 = C1 ∧ C5 is false.

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened initially.
- Additional facts: after event2 happens, no further events can happen; likewise, if event1 happens, no further events can happen.
- Therefore in the actual execution trace event2 has happened and no event1 ever happens later.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Both event1 and event2 are terminal: once either has happened, the system has no further events. Because event2 happened initially, no transitions that produce event1 can occur afterward. So event1 does not occur in the trace.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is equivalent to ""event2 happens"" (a tautology written redundantly). It is true in the initial state because event2 has happened.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" Formally: event1 → event2. In the actual trace event1 never happens, so the implication is vacuously true; also if it were ever evaluated in any state where event1 is false it holds.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" That is □(event1 → event2). Since in every state event1 is false (event2 happened and no further events occur), C2 is true in every state, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" Since C3 holds in every state, it certainly holds in the next state, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" Same reasoning: true.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" True.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" ""Eventually"" means there is some (possibly current) future state where C6 is true. Because C6 already holds now (and in all states), it certainly holds at some future state—so C7 is true.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- C1 is true initially; C2 is a conditional that is vacuously true because event1 never occurs; C3 asserts that C2 is true at all times, which follows from the trace; C4–C6 are nested ""next"" assertions of that invariant and are therefore true; C7 is an ""eventually"" of a statement that already holds, so it is true.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened.
- Additional global facts from the context: after event1 no other events can happen; after event2 no other events can happen. So both event1 and event2 are terminal — once one has happened, no further events occur.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- If event1 occurs at some state, all subsequent states contain no events.
- If event2 occurs at some state, all subsequent states contain no events.
- Because event2 happened initially, from the initial state onward there are no further event occurrences (no event1 ever occurs in the trace).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" (A conditional that is true in any state where either event1 is false or event2 is true.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — C1 is true at every state (globally).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — in the immediate successor state, C2 is true.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — two steps ahead, C2 is true (i.e., next-next C2).
- C5: same as C2: ""C1 always holds"".
- C6: ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds"" — (next-next C2) -> C2.

4) How do these conditions relate and evaluate under the given scenario?
- Because event2 happens initially and after event2 no other events can happen, event1 never occurs anywhere in the trace.
- Therefore the implication in C1 (event1 -> event2) is vacuously true at every state (whenever event1 would have to be true it never is).
- Hence C1 holds in every state, so C2 is true.
- If C2 is always true, then C3 and C4 (which assert C2 in later states) are also true.
- C5 is the same as C2, so it is true as well.
- C6 is an implication whose antecedent (C4) is true and consequent (C5) is true, so C6 is true.

Conclusion: Given the initial event2 and the “no further events after event1 or event2” rules, C6 evaluates to True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: event2 occurs initially and both events are terminal, so event1 never occurs. Hence C1 (event1 -> event2) holds vacuously in every state, so C2, C3, C4 and C5 are all true. Therefore C6 (C4 -> C5) is true."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (true at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen: event1 ⇒ event2.
- After event2, event1 must happen: event2 ⇒ event1.
- Together these give event1 ⇔ event2 (they imply each other). Since event2 is true initially, event1 must also be true; so both happen.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" Given the initial condition and the rules, C1 is true.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" This is logically equivalent to just ""event1 happens"" (because C1 implies event1). Since event1 is true, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is true, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C2 does not hold."" This is the same statement as C3, so C4 is also false.

Step 4 — how they relate and the value of C5
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" C3 and C4 are identical propositions. An implication p ⇒ p is always true (a tautology), so C5 is true regardless of the truth value of C2. Concretely here, C3 is false and C4 is false, and the implication ""false ⇒ false"" is true.

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event2 and event1.
- Initial condition: event2 happens initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, event1 must happen → event1 will occur at some time after event2.
- After event1, no other events can happen → event1 is terminal; once it happens the future is fixed with no further events.

From these rules, event1 does happen (necessarily, after event2).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" Given the rules, C1 is false (because event1 must happen).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" That is the negation of C1, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Negation of C2, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" This asks whether at some future time C3 will be true. Since C3 is false and (because event1 does happen) its truth value cannot flip to true later, C4 is false.
- C5: ""Event1 does not happen."" Same as C1, so false.
- C6: ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds."" This is an implication. Since C4 is false, the implication is vacuously true, so C6 is true.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" C6 already holds now (and will continue to hold), so C7 is true.

4) How the conditions relate and final conclusion
- C1 and C5 are the same statement; C2 is their negation; C3 is the negation of C2 (so identical to C1); C4 posits that C3 will be true at some future time (it will not). C6 is a vacuously true implication because its antecedent C4 is false. Therefore C7, which states that C6 will eventually hold, is true (it holds now and will continue to hold).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: event1 must occur, so C1 and C5 are false, C2 is true, C3 and C4 are false. Hence C6 (C4 → C5) is vacuously true now, so C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is true."

Reasoning (brief):
- Let t0 be the initial state: event2 holds at t0. By the rules the system alternates, so event1 holds at t1, event2 at t2, etc.
- C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is false at t0 (event1 does not hold at t0).
- C2 and C5 (""If C1 holds then event2 happens"") are true at any state vacuously because C1 is false (implication with false antecedent is true).
- C3 (""If event1 happens then C2 holds"") is true at t1: event1 holds at t1 and C2 holds there (vacuously), so C3 holds at t1.
- C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is therefore true at t0 because C3 holds at t1.
- Finally C6 = C4 and C5 is true (both conjuncts are true).

Thus C6 is True."

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time 0, event2 is true.
- Transition rules (given) force alternation: after event2 the next state has event1; after event1 the next state has event2. So the timeline is event2 (t0), event1 (t1), event2 (t2), event1 (t3), ….

2) Transition rules between events
- From any state where event2 holds, the next state has event1.
- From any state where event1 holds, the next state has event2.
- That yields an infinite alternating sequence but that alternation is not needed for the logical trivialities below.

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" Formally event2 -> event2. This is a tautology (always true) in any state.
- C2: same as C1, also a tautology.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is true in every state, C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event2 happens."" A disjunction with a true disjunct (C3) is true, so C4 is true in every state.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" Because C4 holds in every state, it also holds in the next state; so C5 is true in every state.
- C6: ""C1 holds and C5 holds."" Both conjuncts hold in every state, so C6 holds in every state.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" Since C6 is true in every state, C7 is true.

4) How the conditions relate
- C1 and C2 are trivial tautologies.
- C2 being always true makes C3 true.
- C3 ⇒ C4 (trivial), C4 being global ⇒ C5 holds in each state, C1 ∧ C5 ⇒ C6 in each state, and therefore ""always C6"" (C7) is true.

Note/caveat: this conclusion uses the usual reading of ""If … then …"" as material implication and of ""always"" / ""next"" as the standard temporal operators. If those operators have a nonstandard interpretation, the result could differ.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: C1 and C2 are tautologies (p → p). Hence C2 holds in every state, so C3 (""always C2"") is true. Therefore C4 (C3 or event2) is true in every state, so C5 (C4 in the next state) is true in every state. With C1 true and C5 true everywhere, C6 holds in every state, so C7 (""always C6"") is true — assuming standard material implication and usual temporal operators."

True.

Reasoning (concise):
- Initially event2 happened, so ""Event2 happens"" is true.
- After event2 no other events can happen, so event1 never happens. Thus the antecedent of C2 (""if event1 happens then C1"") is always false, making C2 vacuously true.
- If C2 is true now, ""C2 eventually holds"" (C3) is true, and that carries forward to ""C3 holds in the next state"" (C4) and then to ""C4 always holds"" (C5) and ""C5 always holds"" (C6).

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (it is given that “Initially, event1 happened”).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur at some point following event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event2 does not happen” (¬Event2).
- C2: “Event2 does not happen” (same as C1).
- C3: C1 holds and C2 holds → (¬Event2) ∧ (¬Event2), which is equivalent to ¬Event2.
- C4: C1 holds and C2 holds → same as C3, i.e. ¬Event2.
- C5: “If C3 holds, then C4 holds” → C3 ⇒ C4.

Step 4 — how they relate and truth of C5
- From the transition rule “after event1, event2 must happen,” we know in the scenario that Event2 does happen, so C1 and C2 are false, and hence C3 and C4 are false.
- Regardless of that background fact, C3 and C4 are identical statements (both assert ¬Event2). An implication of the form P ⇒ P is always true.
- Therefore C5 (C3 ⇒ C4) is true. (Even with C3 false, a false antecedent makes the implication true; and since C3 ≡ C4, the implication is tautologically true.)

Short answer: C6 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially event1 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur at some later time).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

From these rules the timeline is: event1 occurs initially, then (because it must) event2 occurs later, then nothing else.

3) What each sub-condition means
- C1: ""event2 happens and event1 happens"" (both events occur).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (at some point C1 is true).
- C3: same as C2 (they are identical here).
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event1 happens"" (C3 ⇒ event1).
- C5: ""If C2 holds, then C4 holds"" (C2 ⇒ C4).
- C6: ""C5 holds or event2 happens"" (C5 ∨ event2).

4) How they relate and truth evaluation
- From the context, both event1 and event2 do occur, so C1 is true.
- Since C1 is true at some time, C2 and C3 are true.
- C4: antecedent C3 is true and consequent event1 is true, so C4 is true.
- C5: antecedent C2 is true and consequent C4 is true, so C5 is true.
- C6: C5 is true (and event2 is also true), so the disjunction C6 is true.

Therefore C6 is True.

Short answer: C6 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 holds at the initial moment (time 0).

2) Transition rules
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — interpret as: whenever event2 holds at time t, event1 holds at time t+1.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" — whenever event1 holds at time t, event2 holds at time t+1.
- With the initial event1 at t0, this forces an alternating sequence: t0: event1, t1: event2, t2: event1, t3: event2, … . In particular, at every time at least one of event1 or event2 holds.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: (event2) OR (event1) — at a given time, one of the two events holds.
- C2: C1 always holds — globally, at every time C1 is true.
- C3: C2 holds AND event1 happens — C2 is true globally, and event1 holds (at the current time).
- C4: C3 always holds — at every time C3 is true (i.e., always (C2 ∧ event1)).
- C5: C1 always holds — same as C2.
- C6: If C4 holds, then C5 holds — the implication C4 ⇒ C5.

4) How they relate and truth values
- From the transition rules and initial condition, C1 holds at every time, so C2 (and thus C5) is true.
- C3 holds at the initial time because C2 is true and event1 holds at the initial time.
- C4 requires event1 to hold at every time (because C3 = C2 ∧ event1 and C2 is global). But event1 does not hold at every time (it alternates with event2), so C4 is false in this model.
- Logical relation: C3 implies C2 (since C3 = C2 ∧ event1). Therefore always(C3) implies always(C2). So C4 ⇒ C5 is logically valid in general.

Conclusion about C6
- The implication C4 ⇒ C5 is true: either because in the model C4 is false (false ⇒ true is true), or more generally because always(C3) logically entails always(C2). Hence C6 is True.

(If you intended a different temporal interpretation of ""after"" — e.g., simultaneous occurrence — let me know; the conclusion can change under different semantics.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: C4 is ""always(C3)"" with C3 = (C2 ∧ event1). So C4 implies always(C2). But C2 is precisely ""always(C1)"" (the same as C5). Hence C4 ⇒ C5 holds (and in any model where C4 is false the implication is also true)."

Answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially (so event1 is true in the current scenario).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- “After event1, event2 must happen.” That is a rule/constraint: event1 → event2.
- “After event2, no other events can happen.” So event2 is terminal (nothing happens after event2).

3) What does each sub-condition mean (and their truth values given the context)?
- C1: “If event1 happens, then event2 happens.” This matches the transition rule, so C1 is true.
- C2: “C1 always holds.” The context gives C1 as a rule, so C2 is true (C1 holds as a law).
- C3: “C2 does not hold.” This is the negation of C2, so C3 is false (because C2 is true).
- C4: “Event1 happens and C3 holds.” Since C3 is false, C4 is false (even though event1 is true).
- C5: “C4 does not hold.” Negation of C4; since C4 is false, C5 is true.
- C6: “If event1 happens, then event2 happens.” This is the same as C1, so C6 is true.

4) How these conditions relate and evaluation of C7
- C7: “If C5 holds, then C6 holds.” We found C5 = true and C6 = true, so the implication (C5 → C6) is true.
- More generally, because C6 is true unconditionally (it follows from the given rules), any implication with C6 as consequent is true regardless of C5. But in the given scenario both antecedent and consequent are true, so C7 is true.

Reasoning (concise):
- Let s0 be the initial state (event1 happened); s1 is the next state (event2 happens), and no further states/events occur after s1.
- Evaluate at s0:
  - C1 (""event1 does not happen"") is false (event1 happened at s0).
  - C2 (""event1 happens or C1"") is true (event1 happens at s0).
  - C3 (""if C2 then event2"") is true, because C2 holds at s0 and event2 does occur (in s1).
  - C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is false.
  - C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is true.
  - C6 (""C5 holds in the next state""): at s1, C1 is true (event1 does not happen at s1), so C2 is true at s1, hence C3 is true at s1, so C4 false and C5 true at s1. Thus C6 is true at s0.

Reasoning (brief):
- Events alternate: state0 = event2, state1 = event1, state2 = event2, ...
- C1 ≡ event2, so C2 ≡ ¬C1 is true exactly at event1 states.
- C3 is ""C2 next"" so C3 is true exactly at states whose next state is an event1 state (i.e. at event2 states).
- C4 ≡ (event1) ∧ C3. But C3 is true only at event2 states, so C4 is false at every state (it requires event1 and C3 simultaneously, which never coincide).
- Hence C5 (""C4 next"") is always false, so C6 ≡ ¬C5 is always true.
- Therefore C7 (""C6 next"") is true (since C6 is true in every state, its truth in the next state holds).

Short answer: C6 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time 0, event1 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen. (So once event1 has occurred, there are no subsequent events.)
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen. (If event2 occurs, it is followed by event1.)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" (There is some future time when event2 occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (This is the same kind of eventuality applied to C1 — effectively: at some time in the future the statement “event2 eventually happens” becomes true. Double eventuality reduces to “event2 eventually happens”.)
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" (C2 is false.)
- C4: ""C1 eventually holds."" (Same as C2 — repeated.)
- C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" (Logical OR of C3 and C4.)
- C6: ""Event2 happens or C5 holds."" (Logical OR of event2 and C5.)

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
- Because event1 already happened initially and rule A says no events can happen after event1, no further events can ever occur. Therefore event2 cannot happen — C1 is false.
- If C1 is false, then C2 (eventually C1) is false as well. Hence C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true.
- C4 is the same as C2 and is false.
- C5 = C3 or C4 = true or false = true (because C3 is true).
- C6 = (event2 happens) or C5 = false or true = true.

Conclusion: C6 is True.

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (call that state 0).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur in the next state (event1 -> event2).
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur in the next state (event2 -> event1).
- Starting from state 0 where event2 occurred, the next state (state 1) must therefore be event1. The system alternates: state0: event2, state1: event1, state2: event2, etc.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1, C2, C3, C4: each asserts “event2 happens in the next state” (i.e., in state 1).
  Given the transitions and the initial event2 at state 0, event2 does NOT happen in the immediate next state (state1); event1 does. So C1–C4 are false.
- C5: “If C3 holds, then C4 holds.” An implication with a false antecedent (C3 is false) is true in standard logic, so C5 is true.
- C6: “C2 holds and C5 holds.” C2 is false, C5 is true, so the conjunction is false (C6 is false).
- C7: “If C1 holds, then C6 holds.” C1 is false, so this implication is true (a false antecedent makes the implication true).

4) How these conditions relate and final result
- Summary of truth values: C1–C4 = false; C5 = true; C6 = false; C7 = true.
- Therefore C7 is True.

(If “next state” were intended relative to some other state than the initial one, or if a non-classical interpretation of implication is intended, the result might differ. Under the usual reading above, C7 is true.)

Short answer: C6 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state event1 has happened.
- Additional global constraints given: ""After event1, no other events can happen"" (so once event1 has occurred the system cannot later produce event2), and ""After event2, event1 must happen"" (irrelevant here because event2 will not occur after the initial event1).

2) Transition rules
- If event1 has occurred, the system is terminal with respect to further events: no future events (including event2) can ever occur after any state where event1 has happened.
- If event2 ever occurs in some trace, event1 must occur afterward — but given the first rule and that event1 already happened initially, event2 cannot occur after that, so the second rule does not enable any new trace.

3) Meaning of each condition
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" (the temporal formula F event2).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" i.e. ¬(F event2) — event2 does not eventually happen from the current state.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" i.e. G ¬(F event2) — in every future state, event2 still does not eventually happen.
- C4: ""C1 does not hold"" (same as C2).
- C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds"" i.e. (G ¬F event2) ∨ (¬F event2).
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state"" i.e. X[(G ¬F event2) ∨ (¬F event2)].

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- Because event1 has occurred initially and after event1 no other events can happen, event2 can never occur in the initial state or in any future state. Therefore:
  - C1 is false.
  - C2 (¬C1) is true in the initial state.
  - Since event2 will never occur in any future state, C2 remains true everywhere, so C3 (C2 always holds) is true.
  - C4 is the same as C2, so true.
  - C5 (C3 or C4) is therefore true.
  - In the next state (there is a next state but no events occur there either), the same reasoning applies: event2 will never eventually happen from that next state, so C3 and C4 still hold there, so C5 holds in the next state.

Thus C6 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: event2 can never occur (event1 already happened and forbids further events), so ¬F event2 holds everywhere; hence C3 and C4 hold, so C5 holds in every state — in particular it holds in the next state, making C6 true."

Short answer: C6 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happens initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 does happen at some point after the initial event1).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 happens again, and this alternation continues).

Thus both event1 and event2 do occur (event1 initially, then event2, then event1 again, …).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" — this contradicts the initial condition, so C1 is false.
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" Formally: event2 → (event1 does not happen). But event2 does happen (by the transition rule) while C1 is false, so the implication is false. Hence C2 is false.
- C3: same as C2 (a duplicate): also false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" Since C3 is false and nothing in the system makes it become true later, C4 is false.
- C5: ""C2 holds or C4 holds."" Both disjuncts are false, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""Event1 happens and C5 holds."" Event1 happens (true) but C5 is false, so the conjunction C6 is false.

4) How these conditions relate and final verdict
- Because the system guarantees event1 occurs, C1 is already false, which makes any implication that requires C1 as consequent (C2/C3) false when event2 actually occurs. That propagates falsity through C4 and C5, so C6 (event1 and C5) is false.

Therefore C6 is False.

Short answer: C7 is True (it is vacuously true because C1 is false). Full step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event1 happens, event2 must happen.
- After event2 happens, event1 must happen.
Given the initial event2, these rules imply an alternating pattern (event2 → event1 → event2 → ...), so event2 does in fact occur (it already did initially, and will occur again after any event1).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event2 does not happen.” (a claim that event2 never happens / does not occur)
- C2: same as C1.
- C3: same as C1.
- C4: “C3 does not hold” = not(C3).
- C5: “C2 holds or C4 holds” = C2 ∨ C4.
- C6: “C5 does not hold” = not(C5).
- C7: “If C1 holds, then C6 holds” = C1 → C6.

4) How they relate and truth values (given the context)
- Since event2 happened initially, the statement “event2 does not happen” is false. So:
  - C1 = False
  - C2 = False
  - C3 = False
- C4 = not(C3) = True.
- C5 = C2 ∨ C4 = False ∨ True = True.
- C6 = not(C5) = False.
- C7 is the implication C1 → C6. An implication is true whenever the antecedent is false (regardless of the consequent). Here C1 is false, so C7 is True (vacuously true).

Reasoning (concise):
- Timeline: s0: event2 occurs; s1: event1 occurs; s2+: no events.
- C1 = (event1 or event2) holds at s0 and s1 but fails at s2. So C2 (""always C1"") is false, hence C3 (""eventually C2"") is false.

- Therefore C5 (""eventually C4"") is true (C4 already holds), and C6 (""C5 holds in the next state"") is true (next-state C5 is true).

Answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: If event1 occurs, then event2 must occur afterward (event2 must follow event1).
- Rule B: After event2 occurs, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Because event2 has already happened initially and rule B forbids any events after event2, no occurrence of event1 can ever happen at any later time.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" (There exists some future time when event1 occurs.)
- C2: same as C1.
- C3: C2 holds AND event2 happens (both: event1 will eventually happen, and event2 happens).
- C4: ""Eventually C3 holds."" (At some future time, both C2 and event2 hold.)
- C5: ""Event1 happens AND C4 holds.""
- C6: ""If C1 holds then C5 holds."" (Implication.)
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" (C6 is true at every moment.)

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
- Since event2 happened initially and no events are allowed after event2, event1 can never happen. So C1 and C2 are false.
- event2 does happen (it already has), but C3 requires C2 to be true as well; since C2 is false, C3 is false.
- C4 (""eventually C3"") is false because C3 is false now and cannot become true later (no events can occur to change C2).
- C5 is false because event1 does not happen (C1 false) and C4 is false.
- C6 is the implication ""if C1 then C5"". An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C6 is true in the current state. Moreover, because C1 can never become true (event1 can never occur), the antecedent remains false at all future times, so C6 remains true at all times.
- Therefore C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true.

So C7 is True (C6 holds vacuously and continues to hold forever because event1 can never occur).

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: event2 has already occurred and no events can happen after it, so ""event1 eventually happens"" (C1/C2) is false at every time. Thus the implication C6 (""if C1 then C5"") has a false antecedent everywhere and is vacuously true at every time. Therefore C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened (so the current/initial state is one where event1 has occurred).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen.
(That is, each of event1 and event2 is terminal: once it has occurred, no further events occur afterward.)

Step 3 — what the Ci mean
- C1: ""event1 happens in the next state.""
- C2: ""event1 happens in the next state."" (same as C1)
- C3: C1 or C2 (i.e. event1 happens next, since C1 and C2 are identical this is equivalent to C1)
- C4: C1 or C2 (same as C3)
- C5: C3 or C4 (again redundant — equivalent to C1)

Step 4 — how they relate and final truth value
- Because event1 already happened initially and the rule ""after event1, no other events can happen"" makes the state after that terminal, no event (including event1) can occur in the next state.
- Therefore C1 is false, so C2 is false, hence C3 and C4 are false, and C5 is false.

Note on ambiguity: if by ""no other events"" you meant ""no events other than the same event"" (i.e., the same event may repeat but different events cannot), the answer could change — in that reading event1 could possibly occur again next and C5 could be true. Under the usual reading that ""no other events can happen"" makes the state terminal, C5 is False.

Short answer: C6 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially (in the current/initial state).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (so from the initial state where event1 happened, the next state must have event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal — nothing happens after the state that has event2).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" Given the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"" and that event1 happened initially, C1 is true.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" This is an implication: C1 ⇒ event1. Since event1 already happened in the initial state, this implication is true (an implication is true when the consequent is true).
- C3: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" (Same as C1) — true.
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" (Same as C2) — true.
- C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" Since both C3 and C4 are true, C5 is true.
- C6: ""C2 holds or C5 holds."" Since C2 is true and C5 is true, C6 is true.

4) How they relate / final conclusion
- C1 and C3 are the same claim and are true because event2 must follow the initial event1.
- C2 and C4 are the same implication; they are true because event1 already occurred.
- Therefore C5 is true (disjunction of true statements) and C2 is true, so C6 (C2 ∨ C5) is true.

Note on alternate readings: if one read C2 as meaning ""if event2 occurs next, then event1 also occurs next"" (i.e., both in the same next state), that would be false. Under the natural reading used above (C2 is the implication from C1 to the fact that event1 happened at some point — and in particular it happened initially), C2 is true and so C6 is true.

Short answer: C5 is True, under the usual reading that ""initially"" is the start of the trace (no unspecified prior events). If you allow event1 to have happened before the initial point, the answer could be different — I'll state both cases below.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened at the initial moment.

2) Transition rules
- If event1 happens (at some point), then afterwards event2 must happen.
- If event2 happens, no other events can happen afterwards (event2 is terminal).

Because event2 is terminal and it holds initially, no events can occur after the initial moment.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens"" (both occur at some point).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" (i.e., it is not the case that both events happen).
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" (at every point / in every reachable state, C1 does not hold).
- C4: same as C3.
- C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds"" (equivalently: C2 always holds).

4) How they relate and truth values (standard/minimal interpretation)
- event2 definitely happens (initially).
- Because event2 is terminal, no events happen after initial, so event1 does not happen at or after the initial moment.
- Under the usual assumption that ""initially"" is the start of the timeline (no hidden earlier event1), event1 never happens, so C1 is false.
- Therefore C2 is true. Since nothing can happen later to make C1 true, C2 remains true at all times, so C3 and C4 are true.
- Hence C5 (C3 or C4) is True.

Alternate interpretation (if you allow events before the initial point)
- If event1 might have occurred before the initial point, then both event1 and event2 could have happened (event1 before, event2 initially), making C1 true, C2 false, and thus C5 false. So the definitive answer depends on whether ""initially"" excludes prior occurrences; under the standard temporal-model assumption it does, so C5 = True.

Short answer: C6 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened initially (i.e., at the start of the run).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs at some time, then at some later time event2 occurs).

Given the initial event2 and the ""after event2 nothing else"" rule, there are no further events in the run.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautological implication (p → p). It is true at every time point (true when event1 holds, and vacuously true when it does not).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Means C1 is true at every time point (a global/always assertion).
- C3: Same as C2 (the statement is repeated).
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" A disjunction; true if C3 holds, or if at the current time event1 happens.
- C5: ""C2 holds and C4 holds."" Conjunction of C2 and C4.
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" There is some time (now or in the future) at which C5 is true.

4) How these conditions relate and evaluation
- C1 is a tautology, so it holds at all times. Therefore C2 (always C1) is true, and so is C3.
- Since C3 is true, the disjunction in C4 is true regardless of event1.
- Hence C2 and C4 are both true, so C5 is true now (and always).
- ""Eventually C5"" (C6) is satisfied because C5 already holds at the current time — an eventuality is true if it is already true immediately.

Therefore C6 is True. (The initial event2 and the terminal nature of event2 do not prevent these logical assertions; they are satisfied vacuously or immediately.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: C1 is a tautology, so C2 and C3 hold; therefore C4 holds, so C5 holds now, and hence C6 (""eventually C5"") is satisfied."

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition given: event1 happened initially.
- Also given: ""After event1, no other events can happen"" and ""After event2, no other events can happen."" (So once either event1 or event2 occurs, the system has no further events.)

2) Transition rules
- After event1 occurs, no further events can occur. Since event1 already occurred initially, no other events (including event2) can ever occur afterward.
- After event2 occurs, no further events can occur. (This is moot here because event2 never occurs in this execution.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" (same text appears again as C3 and C6)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (i.e., ¬C1)
- C3: ""Event1 always happens."" (same as C1)
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" So C4 = (¬C1) ∨ C1.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds.""
- C6: ""Event1 always happens."" (same as C1/C3)
- C7: ""C5 holds or C6 holds.""

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- C4 = (¬C1) ∨ C1 is a logical tautology (always true regardless of whether C1 itself is true).
- Therefore C4 holds immediately, and ""C4 eventually holds"" (C5) is true.
- C7 is C5 ∨ C6. Since C5 is true, C7 is true regardless of C6.

Short answer: C7 is True (under the usual interpretation that an event “happens” only at the state where it occurs). Below is the step‑by‑step reasoning you requested.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial (current) state event1 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen (so in the next state after the initial one, event2 occurs).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so the state after the one where event2 happens is terminal — no further events).

3) What does each sub-condition mean (interpreting “happens” as true in the state where the event occurs, not persistent)?
- C1: “Event1 happens and event2 happens.” Means both event1 and event2 occur somewhere in the run (here: event1 at initial state, event2 in the next state). So C1 is true.
- C2: “If event1 happens, then C1 holds.” Given the transition rule, whenever event1 happens it is followed by event2, so the implication holds. C2 is true.
  (Thus C1 is true and C2 is true in the initial state.)
- C3: “Event1 happens and C2 holds.” That is true in the initial state (event1 happened and C2 is true), so C3 is true in the initial state.
- C4: “C3 holds in the next state.” In the next state event2 happens but event1 does not happen there (we assume “event1 happens” is not true in the next state). Therefore C3 is false in the next state, so C4 is false.
- C5: “C4 does not hold.” Since C4 is false, C5 is true.
- C6: “C5 does not hold.” Since C5 is true, C6 is false.
- C7: “C6 does not hold.” Since C6 is false, C7 is true.

4) How these conditions relate to each other (concise chain):
- Initial state: event1 true → by rule event2 will occur next, so C1 true.
- C2 (the implication) is true, so C3 true in initial state.
- C3 is not true in the next state (event1 does not occur there) → C4 false → C5 true → C6 false → C7 true.

Note on semantics: if instead you treated “event1 happens” as a persistent fact true in all future states once it has happened, then C3 would remain true in the next state, making C4 true and flipping the truth values of C5–C7 (in that alternative semantics C7 would be false). The answer above uses the more standard view that an event “happens” at the state where it occurs.

Short answer: C7 is True.

Now the step-by-step reasoning you asked for.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.  
- Initial condition: in the initial state S0, event1 happened (so proposition p := “event1 happens” is true in S0).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- “After event1, event2 must happen” means: if event1 holds in some state, then event2 holds in the next state.  
- “After event2, event1 must happen” means: if event2 holds in some state, then event1 holds in the next state.  
These two rules imply an alternation of events along the timeline: S0: event1, S1: event2, S2: event1, S3: event2, … (but this alternation is not needed for the logical simplification below).

3) What does each sub-condition (C1, C2, C3, etc.) mean?
Let p = “event1 happens”. Then:
- C1: “Event1 happens or event1 happens” = p ∨ p = p.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 = p.
- C3: “C2 does not hold” = ¬C2 = ¬p.
- C4: “C3 does not hold” = ¬C3 = ¬(¬p) = p.
- C5: “If C1 holds, then C4 holds” = (p → p). The formula p → p is a propositional tautology (always true), so C5 holds in every state.
- C6: “C5 holds in the next state” = X(C5). Since C5 is true in every state, X(C5) is true in every state (the next state will also satisfy C5). So C6 is true.
- C7: “C6 holds in the next state” = X(C6). Because C6 is true in every state, X(C6) is true in every state. So C7 is true.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- C1 and C2 both reduce to p. C3 is ¬p and C4 is p again. C5 is the implication p → p, which is always true independently of the truth of p. Because C5 is universally true, any “next” statements about it (C6, C7) are also true in all states. The mutual-event transition rules are consistent with p being true in alternating states, but they are not required to make C5 a tautology — C5 is true purely by logical form.

Conclusion: C7 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: C1 and C2 are p (event1). C5 is (p → p), a propositional tautology true in every state. Hence C6 = X(C5) and C7 = X(C6) are also true."

Short answer: C6 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state event1 has happened (event1 is true at time 0).

2) Transition rules
- If event2 happens at some time, then at some later time event1 must happen (i.e. after event2, event1 must occur).
- After event1 happens, no other events can happen in any future state (event1 is terminal: no event1 or event2 occur afterwards).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: event2 happens or event1 happens (event1 ∨ event2) — a state formula.
- C2: C1 eventually holds (♢C1).
- C3: same as C2 (they are identical here).
- C4: C3 holds in the next state (X C3).
- C5: C4 always holds (□ C4).
- C6: If C2 holds then C5 holds (C2 → C5).

4) How these relate and why C6 is false
- At the initial state s0, event1 is true, so C1 holds at s0. Thus C2 (♢C1) holds at s0 (it is already true immediately).
- Consider the next state s1. By the rule “after event1 no other events can happen,” no events occur in s1 or any later state, so C1 never becomes true again from s1 onward. Therefore C3 (♢C1) is false at s1.
- That makes C4 (X C3) false at s0, and therefore C5 (□ C4) false.
- We have a state (the initial state) where C2 is true but C5 is false, so the implication C2 → C5 is false. Hence C6 is False.

Note: This conclusion assumes the natural reading that ""event1 happened"" is a one-time occurrence at s0 and does not persist, and that ""no other events can happen"" means no future state will satisfy event1 or event2. If instead event1 were interpreted as a persistent propositional fact true in all future states, then the values could change; under that different interpretation C6 could be true. Under the usual “event occurrence” reading above, C6 is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: At the initial state C2 (♢C1) holds because event1 has happened, but C5 (□X♢C1) fails since after the initial event1 no future state can satisfy C1, so C2 → C5 is false."

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Timeline (from the context): at the initial state (call it state 0) event1 happens. Because ""after event1, event2 must happen"", at the next state (state 1) event2 happens. Because ""after event2, no other events can happen"", at state 2 and beyond no events happen. So:
  - state 0: event1 true, event2 false
  - state 1: event2 true, event1 false
  - state 2+: neither event occurs

2) Transition rules between events
- If event1 occurs at some state, then in the next state event2 occurs.
- If event2 occurs, there are no further events in subsequent states (the execution terminates after event2).

3) What each Ci means (evaluated at the initial state unless otherwise stated)
- C1: ""event1 and event1"" — just event1 at the current state (a redundant conjunction).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e., in state 1, event1 must hold (because C1 is event1 ∧ event1).
- C3: ""if C2 holds then event2 happens"" — a material implication at the current state.
- C4: ""if event2 happens then C3 holds"" — implication.
- C5: ""C4 holds and event1 happens"" — conjunction.
- C6: ""event1 and event1"" — same as C1.
- C7: ""C5 or C6"".

4) How the conditions relate and the truth values
Evaluate each Ci at the initial state (state 0):

- C1: true, because event1 holds at state 0.
- C2: false, because in the next state (state 1) event1 does not hold (state 1 has event2 instead).
- C3: true, because C3 is (C2 → event2) and C2 is false, so the implication is true (vacuously).
- C4: true, because at state 0 event2 is false, so (event2 → C3) is true; (and even if you check at state1, event2 there implies C3 there as well, so no contradiction).
- C5: true, because C4 is true and event1 is true at state 0.
- C6: true, same as C1.
- C7 = C5 ∨ C6 = true ∨ true = true.

Therefore C7 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: C6 is true (event1 holds initially). C5 is also true because C4 is vacuously true (event2 does not hold at the initial state) and event1 holds. Hence C7 = C5 ∨ C6 is true."

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened in the initial state.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (so a state with event1 is followed by a state with event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so a state with event2 is followed by a state with event1).
- Together these force an alternating sequence event2, event1, event2, event1, … (so every state has a successor in this model).

3) Meaning of the C-conditions (reading them in ordinary/temporal logic terms)
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is p -> p for p = ""event1"", which is a tautology (always true) in any state where p is well-defined.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" That is next(C1).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" That is always(next(C1)) — C2 is true in every state.
- C4: ""C2 always holds."" (Given text, C4 is the same formula as C3.)
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" i.e. C3 -> C4.

4) How the conditions relate and conclusion
- C1 is a tautology (p -> p), so C1 is true in every state.
- Therefore next(C1) (C2) is true in every state that has a successor; with the given transition rules every state does have a successor, so C2 holds everywhere.
- Hence C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true, and C4 (same as C3) is also true.
- More simply and generally: C3 and C4 are syntactically the same formula, so C3 -> C4 is logically valid (an instance of a -> a). Therefore C5 is true in all models.

So C5 is True.

- C5 (C1 → C4) is true (implication with false antecedent).
- C6 (""C5 holds in the next state"") is false because there is no next state, and in standard temporal logic Xφ is false at a terminal state.

Short answer: C6 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened at the start.

2) Transition rules
- After any event1, event2 must happen next.
- After any event2, event1 must happen next.
- Thus the system produces an alternating sequence: event1, event2, event1, event2, … (event2 occurs immediately after the initial event1).

3) What each condition means (plain reading)
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" (i.e., both events occur at some point.)
- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" (C1 ∨ event2)
- C3: same as C2.
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" (C2 → C3)
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" (always(C4))
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" (eventually(C5))

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- From the transition rules, both event1 and event2 do occur (event1 at start, event2 follows), so C1 is true (it becomes true as soon as event2 occurs).
- If C1 is true then C2 (C1 ∨ event2) is true; C3 is identical to C2, so C2 and C3 are true when C1 is true.
- C4 is the implication C2 → C3. Because C2 and C3 are the same formula, C2 → C3 is a tautology (always true) — it holds at every moment regardless of truth values.
- Therefore C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true.
- If C5 always holds, then certainly C5 holds at some time, so C6 (""C5 eventually holds"") is also true.

Conclusion: C6 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: C4 is the tautology (C2 → C3) because C2 and C3 are identical, so C4 holds at every time; hence C5 (""C4 always holds"") is true, and therefore C6 (""C5 eventually holds"") is also true."

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened initially.
- Also given: once event1 has happened, no other events can happen thereafter. So in this system no further events (including event2) can occur after the start.

2) Transition rules between events
- Rule A: ""After event2, event1 must happen."" In logical form: if event2 happens then event1 happens (C1 restates this).
- Rule B: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So event1 is terminal: nothing can change the state after event1.

3) Meaning of each Ci
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" (This is true in the system — it is given as a rule.)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" (i.e. the negation of C1)
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" (asserts C2 is true at all times)
- C4: ""C3 always holds.""
- C5: ""C4 always holds.""
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" (negation of C5)
- C7: ""C6 always holds.""

4) How they relate and evaluation
- C1: true (given by the second sentence of the context).
- C2: false (it asserts ¬C1).
- C3: false (it asserts C2 always holds, but C2 is false).
- C4: false (it asserts C3 always holds, but C3 is false).
- C5: false (it asserts C4 always holds, but C4 is false).
- C6: true (it asserts C5 does not hold; C5 is false, so ¬C5 is true).
- C7: true if C6 is always true. There are no events that can change truth-values after the initial event1 (event1 is terminal), and we have C6 true now, so ""C6 always holds"" is satisfied. Therefore C7 is true.

So the truth values are: C1 = True, C2 = False, C3 = False, C4 = False, C5 = False, C6 = True, C7 = True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: C1 is given true, so C2 (¬C1) is false. Hence C3, C4, C5 (each asserting the previous ""always holds"") are false. C6 = ¬C5 is true. Since event1 has already happened and no further events can occur, truth values cannot change, so C6 holds at all times. Therefore C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true."

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning (evaluating everything at the initial state):

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened in the initial state (call it s0).

2) Transition rules between events
- After event1, event2 must happen in the next state. So if event1 holds at some state, the next state will have event2.
- After event2, event1 must happen in the next state. So if event2 holds at some state, the next state will have event1.
- Together this forces an alternating trace: s0: event1, s1: event2, s2: event1, s3: event2, … forever.

3) What each sub-condition means (at the initial state s0)
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" At s0 the next state s1 has event2, not event1, so C1 is False.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is False.
- C3: C1 and C2, therefore False (since both C1 and C2 are False).
- C4: C3 does not hold — so C4 is True.
- C5: ""Event2 happens or C4 holds."" Since C4 is True, C5 is True (it holds immediately at s0).
- C6: ""Eventually C5 holds."" Since C5 already holds at s0, C6 is True.
- C7: ""Eventually C6 holds."" Since C6 already holds at s0, C7 is True.

(As a note: ""eventually eventually P"" is equivalent to ""eventually P"", so C7 reduces to C6; but here both hold immediately anyway.)

4) How the conditions relate and final conclusion
- Because C1 and C2 are both false at the initial state, C3 is false and thus C4 is true. That makes C5 true immediately, which makes C6 true, and thus C7 true. Therefore C7 = True.

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events involved: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially, event2 happened.
- Transition rules: after event1, no other events can happen; after event2, no other events can happen. So both event1 and event2 are terminal — once either happens, there are no further events in later states.

2) Transition consequences
- Because event2 already happened initially and it is terminal, no further events (including event1) can occur now or in any later state.

3) Meaning of each sub-condition (interpreting them as state propositions)
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" (i.e., event1 holds / occurs — interpreted as a global/asserted proposition)  
- C2: C1 holds in the next state.  
- C3: C2 holds in the next state.  
- C4: C3 holds in the next state.  
- C5: Event1 happens AND C4 holds.  
- C6: C5 holds OR event1 happens.  
- C7: Event2 happens OR C6 holds.

4) How the conditions relate and their truth-values
- C1 is false: event1 does not (and cannot) happen because event2 already happened and prevents further events.
- Therefore C2 (C1 in the next state) is false, and by the same reasoning C3 and C4 are all false.
- C5 = (event1 AND C4) is false (event1 is false).
- C6 = (C5 OR event1) is false (both disjuncts false).
- C7 = (event2 OR C6) is true because event2 happened initially (so the left disjunct is true).

Conclusion: C7 is True.

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur sometime after event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Thus the actual timeline (given the premises) includes event1 and then event2.

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""event1 happens or event2 happens"" — true because event1 happened (and event2 also happens later).
- C2: same as C1 — true.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens"" — C2 is true and event2 does happen, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens"" — this implication is true (indeed event2 does happen; with a true antecedent and true consequent the implication holds).
- C5: ""C1 holds and C4 holds"" — both true, so C5 is true.
- C6: same disjunction as C1/C2 — true.
- C7: ""C5 holds or C6 holds"" — at least one (in fact both) is true, so C7 is true.

4) How the conditions relate
- C1/C2/C6 are all the same basic disjunction and are true from the initial event1.
- C3 uses C2 and the guaranteed event2, so is true.
- C4 is an implication whose consequent is already true, so it holds.
- C5 combines true facts; therefore C7, being a disjunction of true statements, is true.

Conclusion: C7 is True.

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Two event labels: event1 and event2.
- Initially event2 happened (so at time 0: event2).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen next.
- After event2, event1 must happen next.
These force strict alternation of the events. Starting from event2 at time 0 the execution is:
time 0: event2, time 1: event1, time 2: event2, time 3: event1, … (event2 on even steps, event1 on odd steps).

3) Meaning of each C:
I read the English into standard linear-temporal operators:
- C1: “Event2 always happens” = G(event2) (event2 holds at every state).
- C2: “C1 always holds” = G(C1) = G(G(event2)).
- C3: “C2 always holds” = G(C2) = G(G(G(event2)))) (further nesting).
- C4: “Event2 happens or C3 holds” = event2 ∨ C3.
- C5: “C4 eventually holds” = F(C4).
- C6: “C5 always holds” = G(C5).
- C7: “C6 holds in the next state” = X(C6).

4) How they relate / truth values under the alternating trace
- C1 = G(event2) is false: event2 does not hold on odd steps, so not true at every state.
- C2 = G(C1) is false because C1 is not true at any state (C1 is a global statement that fails), so C2 fails.
- C3 is likewise false (nesting more of the same false property).
- C4 = event2 ∨ C3 reduces effectively to event2 (since C3 is false), so C4 is true at even steps and false at odd steps.
- C5 = F(C4). From any state there is some future state with event2 (in fact within one step), so F(C4) is true at every state. Thus C5 is true everywhere.
- C6 = G(C5) is true because C5 holds in every state.
- C7 = X(C6) asks “does C6 hold in the next state?” Since C6 is true in every state, it also holds in the next state. So C7 is true.

Reasoning (brief):
- From the context the only possible event sequence is: event2 initially, then event1, then nothing.
- So ""event2 happens in the next state"" (C1) is false (the next state after the initial event2 is event1).
- C4 is false (it depends on C3 which is false), so C5 (""if C4 then event2"") is vacuously true; hence C6 (""C5 does not hold"") is false.
- The implication C7 (""if C1 then C6"") therefore has a false antecedent (C1) and a false consequent (C6), so it is vacuously true.

Thus C7 is True."

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
So once one of them happens, they must alternate: event2 → event1 → event2 → … Given the initial event2, event1 will occur next, then event2 again, etc. In particular, event2 does occur (and will recur).

3) What each sub-condition means (reading “does not happen” as “never happens” and “eventually holds” as “holds at some future point”):
- C1: event2 does not happen (i.e. event2 never happens).
- C2: event2 does not happen (same as C1).
- C3: C1 and C2 (equivalently: event2 never happens).
- C4: C3 eventually holds (i.e. at some future time, C3 becomes true).
- C5: C4 holds and event2 happens.
- C6: C5 does not hold (i.e. C5 is false).
- C7: C6 does not hold (i.e. C6 is false).

4) How they relate and truth evaluation:
- Because event2 happened initially, the statement “event2 never happens” is false. So C1 = False and C2 = False.
- C3 = C1 ∧ C2 = False.
- C4 = “C3 eventually holds” — since C3 is the claim “event2 never happens” which is already falsified by the initial event2, C3 can never become true, so C4 = False.
- C5 = C4 ∧ event2 happens = False ∧ True = False.
- C6 = “C5 does not hold” = True (since C5 is false).
- C7 = “C6 does not hold” = False (since C6 is true).

Therefore C7 is False.

(If you intended a different temporal reading of “does not happen” — e.g. “does not happen at this moment” rather than “never happens” — tell me the intended semantics and I can re-evaluate.)

Short answer: C6 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened.
- Also given: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So once event1 has happened (and it already has, initially) there are no further events in any subsequent state.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- If event1 has happened, no events can happen afterwards. Since event1 happened initially, no event2 can ever happen in any later state.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" says that whenever event2 occurs, event1 must occur afterward. This is irrelevant here because event2 never occurs (because event1 already happened and forbids any further events).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" — a conjunction true only if both event2 and event1 hold in the same state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — i.e. in the immediate successor state, C1 is true.
- C3: same as C2 (C1 holds in the next state) — appears duplicated.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — i.e. two steps ahead, C1 holds (because C3 is C1-next).
- C5: ""If C2 holds, then C4 holds"" — implication relating C2 and C4 in the same state.
- C6: ""C5 always holds"" — C5 is true in every state (global/always).

4) How do these conditions relate; is C6 true?
- Because event1 already happened and forbids any further events, event2 never happens in any state. Therefore C1 (event2 ∧ event1) is false in every state (event2 is false everywhere).
- Hence C2 and C3 and C4 are all false in every state (they assert C1 in some future state).
- C5 is the implication (C2 → C4). An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuous truth). Since C2 is false in every state, C5 holds in every state.
- Therefore C6 (""C5 always holds"") is true.

So, under the given assumptions, C6 is True.

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial condition?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 occurs first.

So a valid trace consistent with the rules is an infinite alternating sequence: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...

2) What are the transition rules?
- After event1 must come event2.
- After event2 must come event1.
Thus the system forces perpetual alternation; event1 occurs at time 0 and then recurs infinitely often.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
(Use F for “eventually” and G for “always / globally”.)
- C1: F(event1) — event1 eventually happens (true because event1 happens immediately).
- C2: G C1 = G F(event1) — from every state, event1 will happen at some future point. Because event1 recurs in the alternating trace, this is true (event1 occurs infinitely often).
- C3: F(event1) — same as C1 (true).
- C4: C2 ∧ C3 — both true, so C4 is true.
- C5: G C4 — C4 holds at every state (since C2 = G F(event1) already guarantees F(event1) at every state, and thus C3 holds at every state), so C5 is true.
- C6: F C5 — “eventually C5”. Since C5 already holds now (indeed everywhere), C6 is true.
- C7: F C6 — “eventually C6”. Since C6 is already true, C7 is true.

4) How they relate (quick logical simplifications)
- C2 (G F event1) implies C1 (F event1), so C4 adds nothing beyond C2.
- G(GF event1) = GF event1, and F(F φ) = F φ; thus the nested G/Fs collapse and all the Cs evaluate to true on the alternating trace.
- In particular, because event1 happens infinitely often (GF event1), every higher-level “always”/“eventually” combination in the list is satisfied.

Conclusion: C7 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: the constraints force an infinite alternation (event1 occurs infinitely often), so GF(event1) holds; all nested G/F formulas therefore hold and C7 is satisfied."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (so event1 is true).
- From the context, event2 must happen after event1, so event2 also happens (true). After event2 no other events can happen (irrelevant here because no other events appear in the hypothesis).

Step 2 — transition rules between events
- event1 → event2 (if event1 happens then event2 happens). Given event1 happened, event2 therefore happens.
- After event2 no further events occur (there are no extra events in the hypothesis that would conflict with this).

Step 3 — meaning and truth of each sub-condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautological implication (A → A). True.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" event1 is true, and C1 is true, so the disjunction is true. C2 is true.
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" event2 does happen, and C2 is true, so the implication is true. C3 is true.
- C4: ""Event2 happens or C3 holds."" event2 is true (and C3 is true), so the disjunction is true. C4 is true.
- C5: ""Event1 happens or C4 holds."" event1 is true (and C4 is true), so C5 is true.
- C6: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" Same as C1, true.
- C7: ""C5 holds and C6 holds."" We have C5 = true and C6 = true, so C7 = true.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final answer
- Many conditions are tautologies or disjunctions that are satisfied because event1 and event2 are both true in the given scenario; C1 and C6 are identical tautologies.
- Since every Ci (C1 through C6) evaluates to true under the stated events, their conjunction C7 is true.

Final answer: C7 is True.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
So whichever event occurs (and is considered to occur first) prevents any other event from happening afterwards. Since event2 already happened initially, no other events can happen after that (so event1 does not occur later).

Step 3 — meaning and evaluation of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
  - Evaluation: False, because event2 did happen initially.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" (i.e. (event2 does not happen) OR event1)
  - Evaluation: False. C1 is false, and event1 does not occur (it is prevented by the already-happened event2).
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens.""
  - Evaluation: False, since C2 is false (and event1 is false).
- C4: ""C2 holds and event1 happens.""
  - Evaluation: False (same as C3; it’s a duplicate condition).
- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds.""
  - Evaluation: False, since both C3 and C4 are false.

Step 4 — how they relate
- C2 depends on C1 or on event1. C3 and C4 both require C2 and event1. C5 requires both C3 and C4. Because event2 occurred initially, C1 is false and event1 cannot occur afterward, so all subsequent conditions (C2–C5) are false.

Final answer
- C5 is False.

(If you allow the edge case that event1 and event2 could both occur simultaneously at the initial moment, the truth values can change: event1 could be true while event2 is also true, making C2, C3, C4, and C5 true. The above evaluation assumes the usual temporal interpretation that ""after X"" excludes any later occurrence once X has happened, and that event2 occurred initially so event1 does not occur.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Because event2 occurred initially, C1 is false and event1 cannot occur later, so C2–C4 are false and thus C5 (C3 and C4) is false."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (it is the initial event).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., once event2 has occurred, an occurrence of event1 will follow).
- Rule B: After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" (asserts event1 never occurs)
- C2: ""Event1 does not happen."" (same as C1)
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" i.e. ""always: event1 does not happen"" (global claim that event1 never occurs at any time)
- C4: ""C1 holds or C3 holds."" (either event1 doesn't happen now/at the relevant point, or it never happens)
- C5: ""Event1 does not happen."" (again the same claim)
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" (both the disjunction and the repeated claim hold)
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" (for all times/always, C6 is true)

Step 4 — evaluation and final answer
- From Rule A, after the initial event2, event1 must occur. Therefore the claim ""event1 does not happen"" is false.
- So C1, C2, and C5 are false. Consequently C3 (""always: event1 does not happen"") is false.
- C4 (C1 or C3) is false, and C6 (C4 and C5) is false.
- Therefore C7 (""C6 always holds"") is false.

Conclusion: C7 is False.

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time 0 (the start) event1 has happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1, event2 must happen. (So because event1 happens initially, event2 will happen at some later step.)
- Rule B: After event2, no other events can happen. (event2 is terminal; the run ends or no further events occur.)
So the only possible timeline consistent with the rules is: time 0: event1; time 1: event2; then no more events.

3) What does each sub-condition mean? (interpreting temporal operators in the usual way: ""always"" = globally at all times, ""eventually"" = at some time in the future)
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (This asserts event2 never occurs.)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (C1 is true at every time point in the run.)
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" (Either C2 is true now, or event1 happens now.)
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" (C3 is true at every time point.)
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" (C4 true at every time point.)
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" (C5 true at every time point.)
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" (There exists some time at which C6 is true.)

4) How these conditions relate and evaluation on the actual timeline
Use the actual timeline: t0: event1 happened; t1: event2 happens; thereafter nothing.

- C1 (event2 does not happen): false, because event2 does happen at t1.
- C2 (C1 always holds): false, because C1 is false (so it cannot hold at all times).
- C3 (C2 holds or event1 happens): at t0 this is true (event1 happened at t0). At t1 this is false (event1 does not happen at t1 and C2 is false). So C3 is not globally true.
- C4 (C3 always holds): false, because C3 fails at t1.
- C5 (C4 always holds): false (C4 is already false).
- C6 (C5 always holds): false.
- C7 (C6 eventually holds): asks whether at some time C6 is true. C6 is false at every time (it never becomes true), so C7 is false.

Conclusion: C7 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Because event2 does occur, C1 is false (so C2 is false), which makes C3 fail at t1, hence C4–C6 are false at every time; therefore C6 never becomes true, so C7 (eventually C6) is false."

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 does occur sometime after event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal, but it does occur).

Thus the actual run is: event2 happens first, then event1 happens; both events occur.

3) What does each sub-condition mean (and its truth value given the run)?
- C1: ""event1 happens or event2 happens."" True (both happen).
- C2: same as C1. True.
- C3: same as C1. True.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" C3 is true, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""If C2 holds, then C4 holds."" Antecedent C2 is true and consequent C4 is true, so the implication C5 is true.
- C6: ""C1 holds or C5 holds."" Both are true, so C6 is true.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" This asserts ¬C6, but C6 is true, so C7 is false.

4) How the conditions relate and final conclusion
- From the initial facts and transition rules we get event1 and event2 both true.
- That makes C1, C2, C3 true → C4 true → C5 true → C6 true → C7 (¬C6) false.

Therefore C7 is False.

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened in the initial state.

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: After event1, no other events can happen. Practically this means there is no successor state after the state where event1 has occurred (or, at least, no state in which any event holds).
- Rule B: After event2, event1 must happen (i.e. if event2 occurs then event1 must occur afterward).

3) Meaning of each Ci
- C1: ""event1 happens and event2 happens."" Given the initial state contains event1 and Rule A prevents any further events after event1, event2 cannot occur (there is no prior state before the initial one where event2 could have happened). So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" Since event1 does happen (initially), C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" If C2 is true now then it certainly holds at some time in the future (it holds already), so C3 is true.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event1 happens."" C3 is true, so the implication requires event1 to hold; event1 does hold, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" This is a next-state assertion (X C4). Because after event1 there is no next state (Rule A), standard temporal semantics make X φ false at a state with no successor. Therefore C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state"" (X C5). Again there is no next state, so X C5 is false; C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold"" (¬C6). Since C6 is false, ¬C6 is true.

4) How they relate / final conclusion
- Propagating truth values: C1 = false → C2 = true → C3 = true → C4 = true → C5 = false → C6 = false → C7 = true.
- Therefore C7 is True.

Note: This uses the usual interpretation that ""next"" is false when no successor state exists (as in LTL). If your logic treats next-state assertions at terminal states differently, the answers for C5–C7 could change. Under the standard interpretation above, C7 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: the initial state contains event1 and is terminal (no successor), so any X φ is false there. That makes C5 and C6 false, hence C7 = ¬C6 is true."

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has occurred initially.

2) Transition rules between events
- After event2, event1 must occur.
- After event1, event2 must occur.
So starting from the initial event2, event1 must occur next (and then event2 after that, etc.). In other words, event1 does occur (indeed the two events alternate, starting with event2 → event1 → event2 → ...).

3) What each Ci means
- C1: “Event1 does not happen.”
- C2: “Event1 does not happen.” (same as C1)
- C3: “C1 holds and C2 holds.” Since C1 and C2 are identical, C3 is equivalent to “Event1 does not happen.”
- C4: “C3 does not hold.” So C4 is equivalent to “Event1 does happen.”
- C5: “Event1 does not happen.” (again same as C1)
- C6: “If C4 holds, then C5 holds.” Unpacked: “If event1 does happen, then event1 does not happen.” (a contradiction when C4 is true and C5 false)
- C7: “C6 always holds.”

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- From the transition rules and the initial event2, event1 must happen. Therefore “Event1 does not happen” (C1, C2, C3, C5) is false, and C4 (“event1 does happen”) is true.
- Given C4 is true and C5 is false, the implication C6 (“if C4 then C5”) is false.
- C7 asserts that C6 always holds; since C6 is false in the actual scenario, C7 is false.

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened initially.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen (so the system stays in a state where nothing further occurs).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is also terminal if it were to happen). In our run, event2 already happened, so nothing else happens thereafter.

3) Meaning of each Ci and evaluation from the initial state
(Interpretation used: ""always"" = holds at all times; ""eventually"" = holds at some time ≥ now; ""does not hold"" = logical negation.)

- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" False — event1 did not happen initially (event2 did), and no future events can make event1 true.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" False — C1 is false now and, because no events occur after event2, C1 cannot become true later.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" True — C2 is false, so its negation holds.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" True — C3 already holds now, so it is true eventually.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" False — C4 is true, so its negation is false.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" True — C5 is false, so its negation is true.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" False — C6 is true, so its negation is false.

4) How they relate / final conclusion
- The Ci chain alternates negation and ""eventually"" but because the system is frozen after the initial event2, truth values do not change over time. That gives the truth assignments above and therefore C7 is False.

I'll walk through each part step by step.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (so event1 is true at the start).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur sometime after event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal). A consistent timeline is: event1 occurs, then event2 occurs, then nothing else.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Formally: event2 ⇒ event1.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" So C2 = ¬C1.
- C3: Same as C2 (it repeats ""C1 does not hold""), so C3 = ¬C1 as well.
- C4: ""Event1 happens and C3 holds."" So C4 = event1 ∧ ¬C1.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" Interpreting ""always"" temporally, C5 = Always(C4).
- C6: ""C2 holds or C5 holds."" So C6 = ¬C1 ∨ Always(C4).

(Nota bene: C2 and C3 are duplicates.)

4) How do these conditions relate given the context?
- From the context timeline, event2 does happen and event1 does happen (event1 earlier, then event2). Therefore the implication C1 (event2 ⇒ event1) is true in this world (antecedent true and consequent true).
- Hence ¬C1 is false, so C2 and C3 are false.
- C4 = event1 ∧ ¬C1 is false because ¬C1 is false (even though event1 is true).
- C5 = Always(C4) is false (C4 is already false at least at the initial moment).
- C6 = ¬C1 ∨ Always(C4) = false ∨ false = false.

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened at the start.
- Additional facts: both event1 and event2 are terminal: ""after event1, no other events can happen"" and ""after event2, no other events can happen.""

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Once event1 occurs, no further events can occur afterward.
- Once event2 occurs, no further events can occur afterward.
- Because event1 already occurred initially, no events can occur after that point — in particular event2 cannot occur at any later time.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" (i.e., event1 happens AND event2 never happens)
- C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" (a disjunction)
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" (C3 is true at all times / invariant)
- C5: ""If event2 happens, then C4 holds."" (implication: event2 ⇒ C4)
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" (negation of C5)
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" (C6 is true at all times)

4) How do these conditions relate — truth-values deduced
- From the initial facts, event2 never happens. Therefore C1 is True.
- Event1 happened initially and C1 holds, so C2 is True.
- C3 is ""event2 happens OR C2 holds."" Since C2 is True, C3 is True.
- Because no events happen after the initial state, the truth values do not change; thus C3 is always true. So C4 is True.
- C5 is ""if event2 happens then C4 holds."" Since event2 never happens, the implication is vacuously true (or, if you prefer: there is no time at which event2 occurs and C4 would need to be checked), so C5 is True.
- C6 is ""C5 does not hold."" But C5 does hold, so C6 is False.
- C7 is ""C6 always holds."" Since C6 is False, C7 is False.

Final conclusion: C7 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: event2 never occurs, so C1–C5 are true (C5 holds vacuously), hence C6 (""C5 does not hold"") is false, so C7 (""C6 always holds"") is false."

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step‑by‑step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially: event2 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (so from the initial state there will be a state where event1 occurs).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal with respect to further events).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" (F event1).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" (F C1), i.e. eventually there is a state from which event1 will eventually happen.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" (¬C2).
- C4: same as C1.
- C5: C3 and C4 (¬C2 ∧ C4).
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds"" (F C5).
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state"" (X C6).

4) How they relate / truth values
- From the rules, event1 will occur after the initial event2, so C1 is true in the initial state.
- If C1 is true now, then ""eventually C1"" (C2) is also true (F is “eventually”; if something already holds then it holds eventually). So C2 is true.
- C3 = ¬C2 is therefore false.
- C4 = C1 is true.
- C5 = C3 ∧ C4 is false (false ∧ true = false).
- C6 = F C5 is false because C5 never becomes true (C3 is always false because C2 is true and cannot later become true→false).
- C7 = X C6 asks whether C6 is true in the next state; since C6 is false in all states, C7 is false.

Therefore C7 is False.

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state (call it state0), event1 happened (event1 is true at state0).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (interpreted as: if event1 is true at a state, then event2 is true at the next state).
- After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 is true at a state, then event1 is true at the next state).
- These rules force the run to alternate: state0: event1, state1: event2, state2: event1, state3: event2, … (1,2,1,2,...).

3) Meaning of each Ci
- C1: ""event2 happens in the next state"" — i.e. X event2 (true at a state iff the next state has event2).
- C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens"" — i.e. (X event2) ∨ event1, evaluated at the current state.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — G((X event2) ∨ event1) (C2 must be true at every state).
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — G(G((X event2) ∨ event1)). (Applying G twice is equivalent to once.)
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" — X G((X event2) ∨ event1).
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state"" — X X G((X event2) ∨ event1).
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds"" — F (X X G((X event2) ∨ event1)).

4) How they relate and truth values
- Evaluate C1 at state0: state1 has event2, so C1 is true at state0.
- Evaluate C2 at state0: C1 is true so C2 is true at state0 (also event1 is true there).
- But consider any state where event2 is true (e.g., state1). At such a state:
  - Next state has event1, so C1 (X event2) is false.
  - event1 at the current state is false.
  - Therefore C2 = (X event2) ∨ event1 is false at any event2-state (e.g., state1).
- Since C2 is false at state1, C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false.
- C4 (another always) is also false (G twice adds nothing).
- C5 = X C4 is false (C4 is false at every state, so it's false in the next state).
- C6 = X C5 is false.
- C7 = F C6 asks whether C6 is true at some future state. But C6 is never true (it is false in every state), so C7 is false.

Conclusion: C7 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: C2 = (X event2) ∨ event1 is false at every event2-state (e.g. state1). Hence G((X event2) ∨ event1) is false at every state, so C6 is never true at any future state and therefore F C6 (C7) is false."

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened (so at time 0 event1 is true).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur.
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur.
Thus the system forces an alternating sequence: event1, then event2, then event1, then event2, … (event1 occurs infinitely often, starting at the initial step).

3) What does each sub-condition mean? (interpreting each Ci as a global/temporal statement)
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" (i.e. event1 never occurs.)
- C2: ""Event1 does not happen."" (same as C1)
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" (i.e. at some future time the statement C2 becomes true — equivalently, at some future time event1 never occurs from that point onward)
- C4: ""C1 holds and C3 holds."" (both of the above)
- C5: ""Event1 does not happen."" (again same)
- C6: ""C4 holds or C5 holds.""
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" (C6 is true at every time)

4) How do these conditions relate to each other and what's their truth value?
- From the initial condition and the transition rules, event1 does occur (at time 0) and will occur repeatedly. Therefore any statement of the form ""Event1 does not happen"" (C1, C2, C5) is false.
- C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is false because C2 never becomes true at any future time (event1 keeps occurring).
- C4 (C1 and C3) is false because both conjuncts are false.
- C6 (C4 or C5) is false (both disjuncts false).
- C7 (""C6 always holds"") is therefore false (C6 is false already at the initial time, so it cannot hold always).

Short answer: C7 is True (given the usual temporal-semantics where ""next"" is false in a terminal state). Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 has happened (so at the initial state event2 is true/happened).

2) Transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — any state where event1 has occurred is terminal (no outgoing transitions).
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" — any state where event2 has occurred is terminal.
- Because event2 holds initially, the system is already in a terminal state and there are no successor states.

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" This is just the same proposition repeated; it reduces to simply ""event2 happens"" (true in the initial state).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 already holds at the initial state, ""eventually C1"" is true (eventually includes the current state).
- C3: same as C1, so true in the initial state.
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" At the initial state: antecedent true and consequent true, so C4 holds there.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" We must check C4 at every state. Because the system is in a terminal state where event2 holds forever (no further transitions), in every reachable state C2 and C3 are true, so C4 is true in every reachable state; therefore C5 holds.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" This asserts that there exists a successor state and that in that successor C5 is true. But there is no successor state (the initial state is terminal because event2 occurred). Under the standard semantics where the next operator is false in a state with no successor, C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" This is the negation of C6; since C6 is false, C7 is true.

4) How they relate / final conclusion
- Because event2 holds initially and makes the current state terminal, eventuality formulas that are already true hold, the implication C4 holds everywhere, so C5 is true. However, there is no next state, so the ""next"" claim C6 is false, hence its negation C7 is true.

Caveat: If you adopt a different semantics that treats terminal states as stuttering into an identical successor (i.e., there is always a ""next"" identical state), then C6 would be true and C7 false. Under the usual temporal logic convention where Xφ is false in states without a successor, C7 is true.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True

Reason: the initial state is terminal (no successor), so C6 = X C5 is false (X is false in states without a successor), hence C7 = ¬C6 is true."

Short answer: C6 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (at the start).
- Additional given: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Also ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So once event2 has occurred (and we are already after it), no further events (including event1) can ever occur.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Both event1 and event2 are terminal: if either occurs, no other events can occur afterward.
- Because event2 already occurred initially, the system is in a terminal state and no future events will occur (in particular, event1 will not occur at any later time).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""event2 happens or event1 happens."" Given the initial condition, C1 is true (event2 has happened).
- C2: ""event1 happens and C1 holds."" Since C1 is true, C2 is equivalent to ""event1 happens."" But event1 does not happen (and cannot happen after event2), so C2 is false.
- C3: same as C2, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" That asks whether C3 will be true now or at some future time. Since C3 is false now and cannot become true in the future (no more events can occur), C4 is false.
- C5: ""C2 holds or C4 holds."" Both C2 and C4 are false, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" That asks whether C5 will be true now or at some future time. Because no future events can change the situation, C5 will never become true, so C6 is false.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other (brief logical simplification)?
- C1 is true (because event2 happened).
- C2 and C3 reduce to ""event1 happens"" (because C1 is already true).
- C4 is ""eventually event1"".
- C5 is ""event1 or eventually event1"", which is equivalent to ""eventually event1"".
- C6 is ""eventually (eventually event1)"" which is equivalent to ""eventually event1"".
- Since event1 cannot happen (we are after event2 and no further events can occur), ""eventually event1"" is false, so C6 is false.

Conclusion: C6 is False.

False — event2 already occurred and no further events can happen, so event1 cannot occur, making C2–C5 false and thus C6 (eventually C5) false."

Summary answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially.

2) Transition rules between events
- After event2, event1 must happen. (So event2 -> event1.)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (So event1 -> event2.)

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This matches the rule event1 -> event2, so C1 is true.
- C2: same as C1; so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Given C2 is true by the context, C3 is true.
- C4: same as C1/C2; so C4 is true.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" With C3 true and C4 true, the implication C5 is true.
- C6: ""C1 holds or C5 holds."" Since C1 is true (and C5 is also true), C6 is true.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" This is ¬C6.

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- Because C1 (and C5) hold, C6 is true.
- Therefore C7 = ¬C6 is false.

So C7 is False.

Reason: C1 (and thus C2/C4) is true, so C6 = C1 ∨ C5 is true; hence C7 (which is ¬C6) is false."

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened (we are in the state right after event1).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen at some later step (so event2 will occur on the run).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

From these rules the actual possible timeline is: s0 = initial state (event1 has happened, event2 not yet), then s1 = next state (event2 has happened). s1 is terminal (no s2).

3) What each sub-condition means (interpreting them as evaluated in the initial state s0 unless a temporal operator is given)
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" — i.e. event2 never occurs on the run.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" = not C1.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" = not C2.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" = not C3.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" = not C4.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state"" = at s1, C5 is true.
- C7: ""C6 always holds"" = C6 is true in every state (s0, s1, ...).

4) Truth values and their relations
- From the rules, event2 does happen (event1 forces event2), so C1 is False.
- C2 = not C1 → True.
- C3 = not C2 → False.
- C4 = not C3 → True.
- C5 = not C4 → False.
- C6 asserts that C5 holds in the next state (s1). But C5 is a formula built from C4, C3, etc., and those are global/boolean here (their truth does not flip just because we move states, since they refer to whether event2 happens or to negations of those booleans). In particular C5 is False in s1 as well, so C6 is False.
  (Also: even if you re-evaluate the chain at s1, the same alternation gives C5 False because event2 did occur, so C1 is still False, etc.)
- C7 says C6 holds at every state. Since C6 is False at s0 (and at s1), C7 is False.

Therefore C7 is False under the usual readings of ""does not happen"" (meaning ""never happens"") and ""next state"". If you meant different semantics (e.g., ""does not happen in the current state"" or a different treatment of next at terminal states), tell me which and I can re-evaluate.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event2 must occur, so C1 is false; the negation chain makes C5 false in every state, so C6 (""C5 in the next state"") is false at the initial state, hence C7 (""always C6"") is false."

Reasoning (timeline view):
- t0 (initial): event2 happens. The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" makes C1 true. So C2 (event2 and C1) is true, and hence C3 is true. Therefore C4 (event2 or C3) is true at t0. C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is true at t0 because C4 already holds now.
- t1 (after t0): event1 happens, and by the context no further events can occur afterwards. At t1 and thereafter, event2 (and the event-occurrence parts of C2/C3/C4) no longer hold, so C4 is false and therefore C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is false at t1.
- C6 (""C5 always holds"") requires C5 to be true at every time, but it fails at t1, so C6 is false. C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") would require C6 to become true at some time; since C6 is never true, C7 is false.

Short answer: C6 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened at the start.  
- Because event2 happened initially and ""after event2, no other events can happen,"" no other events (including event1) can ever happen later.

2) Transition rules between events
- Rule A: If event2 has happened, no other events can occur afterwards (event2 is absorbing).
- Rule B: If event1 has happened, no other events can occur afterwards (event1 is absorbing).
- Given event2 happened initially, the system is already in an absorbing state; no further events can occur.

3) Meaning and evaluation of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Given the initial event2 and the absorbing rule, event1 does not occur. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" C1 is false, although event2 does happen. The conjunction is false (false ∧ true = false).
- C3: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" Same as C2, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" This is an implication. Since C2 is false, the implication is true (a false antecedent makes the material implication true).
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" C4 already holds now, so ""eventually holds"" is true.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" This is the negation of C5. Since C5 is true, C6 is false.

4) How they relate (summary)
- C1 false → C2 and C3 false.  
- C2 false ⇒ C4 (implication) true (vacuously).  
- C4 true ⇒ C5 true (it holds now, so it holds eventually).  
- C5 true ⇒ C6 (the negation) false.

Therefore, C6 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event2 initially prevents event1, so C1 (and thus C2/C3) is false; C4 is vacuously true, so C5 is true, hence C6 (""C5 does not hold"") is false."

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition (time t0): event1 happens.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After an event1 state, event2 must happen next (at t1).
- After an event2 state, event1 must happen next.
- So the system alternates: t0: event1, t1: event2, t2: event1, t3: event2, ….

3) What does each sub-condition mean? (Evaluate truth at t0 and at t1)
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is equivalent to ""event1 happens."" 
  - At t0: true (event1 happens). At t1: false (event2 happens).
- C2: same as C1 (""Event1 happens and event1 happens"").
  - At t0: true. At t1: false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold.""
  - At t0: false (because C2 holds at t0). At t1: true (because C2 does not hold at t1).
- C4: ""Event1 happens or C3 holds.""
  - At t0: true (event1 happens). At t1: true (event1 does not happen but C3 holds at t1).
- C5: ""C4 does not hold.""
  - At t0: false (C4 holds). At t1: false (C4 holds at t1 too).
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state.""
  - Evaluate C6 at t0: it asks whether C5 holds at t1. C5 is false at t1, so C6 is false at t0.
  - (If you considered C6 at other times, same pattern: C5 is always false because C4 is always true, so C6 is always false.)

4) How do these conditions relate, and is C7 true?
- C7: ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds."" At t0, C1 is true and C6 is false, so the implication (true → false) is false at t0.
- Therefore C7 is false (given the initial state and the transition rules).

Conclusion: C7 is False.

True

Reasoning (concise):
- Let s0 be the initial state (event1 occurred). At some later state s1 event2 must occur; after that no events occur.
- C2 requires ""event2 happens now"" AND ""event2 happens in the next state"" (C1). Those two cannot both be true: if event2 happens now, then by the premise nothing can happen afterward (so it cannot also happen in the next state); if event2 happens in the next state, it does not happen now. So C2 never holds.
- Thus C3 (C2 eventually holds), C4 (C3 holds next), and C5 (C4 eventually holds) are all false at all times.
- C6 is ""C5 does not hold"", so C6 is true at all times.
- Therefore C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true."

Short answer: C6 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (explicitly stated ""Initially, event2 happened"").

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has occurred, no further events can occur afterwards).
- After event1, no other events can happen (if event1 occurs, no later events can occur).
- Given the initial condition that event2 already happened, no other events can happen after that moment.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (i.e. event2 is false)
- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" (event2 is true AND event2 is false) — logically inconsistent/contradictory
- C3: ""Event2 happens and C2 holds."" (requires C2 to be true, but C2 is contradictory)
- C4: ""C3 holds and event2 happens."" (requires C3)
- C5: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" (identical to C2)
- C6: ""C4 holds or C5 holds."" (disjunction of C4 and C5)

4) How do these conditions relate and what is their truth value?
- From the initial condition, event2 happened, so C1 (""event2 does not happen"") is false.
- C2 (event2 and C1) requires event2 true and C1 true; because C1 is false, C2 is false. (Also C2 is internally contradictory.)
- C3 requires C2 to be true, so C3 is false.
- C4 requires C3 to be true, so C4 is false.
- C5 is the same as C2, so false.
- C6 = C4 or C5 = false or false = false.

Therefore, C6 is False.

I'll state a clear semantic assumption up front and then answer the four parts step by step.

Assumption: read ""X always happens"" as the usual temporal logic G(X) — i.e. the proposition ""Event2 always happens"" means ""event2 is true at every state along the execution (globally)"". Events are instantaneous propositions true at particular states; after event1 occurs the system reaches a terminal state where no events are true.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event2 and event1.
- Initial condition: in the initial state s0, event2 happened (event2 is true in s0).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2 occurs (s0), event1 must happen next (so the next state s1 has event1 true).
- After event1 occurs (s1), no other events can happen: s1 is terminal (no further states with events).

So the only execution consistent with the description is the finite trace: s0 (event2) → s1 (event1) → end.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
Interpreting ""Event2 always happens"" as G(event2):

- C1: G(event2) — event2 is true in every state.
- C2: G(event2) — same as C1.
- C3: G(event2) — same as C1.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — X(C3): C3 is true at the next state.
- C5: ""If C2 holds, then C4 holds"" — (C2 → C4) at the current state.
- C6: ""C5 always holds"" — G(C5), i.e. the implication C2→C4 holds in every state.
- C7: ""C1 holds and C6 holds"" — C1 ∧ C6.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other (truth evaluation on the actual trace)?
Evaluate each Ci on the trace s0 → s1:

- C1, C2, C3 (G(event2)): false. Reason: event2 is true in s0 but false in s1, so it is not true at every state.
- C4 (X(C3)): false at s0 because C3 is false in s1.
- C5 (C2 → C4): true at s0 (and at s1) because its antecedent C2 is false, so the implication is vacuously true.
- C6 (G(C5)): true, because C5 is true in every state of the trace.
- C7 = C1 ∧ C6: false ∧ true = false.

Conclusion
C7 is False.

(If you intended a different reading of ""always happens"" — for example “event2 happens at least once” or “event2 holds at the current state” — the truth values can change. Tell me which alternative semantics you meant and I’ll re-evaluate.)

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial facts from the context:
  - ""Initially, event1 happened."" So event1 is true.
  - ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So if event1 happens, then event2 does not happen; with event1 true, event2 is false.
  - (Also: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" — not directly needed once we know event2 is false.)

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- The hypothesis gives a set of logical implications (conditions C1–C6) about events and other conditions. They are:
  - C1: event1 -> event2
  - C2: event1 -> C1
  - C3: C2 -> event1
  - C4: event1 -> event2 (same as C1)
  - C5: C3 -> C4
  - C6: event1 -> C5
  - C7: event1 ∧ C6 (the conjecture we must evaluate)

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1 and C4: ""If event1 happens then event2 happens.""
- C2: ""If event1 happens then C1 is true (i.e. that implication holds).""
- C3: ""If C2 is true then event1 happens.""
- C5: ""If C3 is true then C4 is true.""
- C6: ""If event1 happens then C5 is true.""
- C7: ""event1 happens and C6 holds.""

(Also note C1 and C4 are identical.)

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
Use standard truth of material implication (A -> B is true whenever A is false; if A is true then A -> B is true iff B is true).

- From the context: event1 = True, event2 = False (because event1 forbids other events).
- C1 = (event1 -> event2). With event1 True and event2 False, C1 = False.
- C2 = (event1 -> C1). event1 True but C1 False, so C2 = False.
- C3 = (C2 -> event1). C2 is False, so C3 = True (false antecedent makes implication true).
- C4 = same as C1 = False.
- C5 = (C3 -> C4). C3 True and C4 False, so C5 = False.
- C6 = (event1 -> C5). event1 True and C5 False, so C6 = False.
- C7 = event1 ∧ C6 = True ∧ False = False.

Therefore C7 is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: From the context event1 = True and event2 = False. Then C1 (event1 -> event2) is False, C2 is False, C3 is True, C4 is False, C5 is False, C6 is False, so C7 = event1 ∧ C6 = True ∧ False = False."

Short answer: C5 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened in the initial state.

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: ""After event1, event2 must happen."" (That is, whenever event1 occurs, event2 occurs afterwards — logically: event1 → event2.)
- Rule B: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" (Once event2 has occurred, the system has no further events.)

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" (the implication event1 → event2)
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (the implication in C1 is true in the next state)
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" (i.e., C1 does not hold in the next state)
- C4: ""C2 does not hold."" (same as C3)
- C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" (i.e., C2 is false OR C2 is false — equivalent to ¬C2)

4) How they relate and evaluation
- Since event2 already happened initially and rule B says no further events can happen after event2, in the next state event1 cannot occur.
- C1 is the implication event1 → event2. In the next state, because event1 does not occur, that implication is vacuously true (an implication with a false antecedent is true). So C2 is true.
- Therefore C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is false, and C4 is also false.
- C5 = C3 ∨ C4 = false ∨ false = false.

Conclusion: C5 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Because event2 already occurred and no events can happen afterward, event1 is false in the next state, so the implication C1 (event1 → event2) is vacuously true there; hence C2 is true, C3 and C4 are false, and C5 = C3 ∨ C4 is false."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state (time 0) event2 has happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen in the next state.
- After event2, event1 must happen in the next state.
- Together these force an alternating sequence: starting from event2 at t=0, we must have event1 at t=1, event2 at t=2, event1 at t=3, etc., indefinitely.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions (interpreting ""always"" as a global/for-all-states operator)
- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" — means in every state/event2 holds. Given the alternation, event2 does not hold in the states where event1 holds, so C1 is false.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds"" — requires both that event1 holds in the current state and that C2 is true globally. C2 is false, so C3 is false in every state (even in states where event1 holds).
- C4: ""C3 does not hold"" — since C3 is false everywhere, C4 is true (everywhere).
- C5: ""C1 holds and C4 holds"" — requires C1 true and C4 true. C1 is false, so C5 is false (everywhere).
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state"" — since C5 is false in every state, C6 is false (everywhere).
- C7: ""C6 always holds"" — requires C6 true in every state; C6 is false, so C7 is false.

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- Because the system forces alternation, event2 is not true in all states, so any condition that depends on ""event2 always happens"" (C1/C2) is false. That makes C3 false and C4 true, but C5 (which needs C1) false, hence C6 false and C7 false.
- Final answer: C7 is False.

Short answer: Under the usual reading that “eventX happens” means “eventX occurs at the current step” and “always” means “at every step (globally)”, C7 is False. Below I show the step-by-step reasoning and also point out an alternative reading that would flip the answer.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial step, event2 happens.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After (i.e. immediately following) event2, event1 must happen. So once event2 occurs, the next step has event1.
- Rule B: After event1 occurs, no other events can occur (event1 is terminal).

A minimal timeline (steps) under these rules:
- Step 0: event2 happens (given).
- Step 1: event1 must happen (by Rule A).
- Step 2 and beyond: no events can happen (by Rule B), so nothing happens.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
(Interpretation assumed: “eventX happens” = true at the step where X occurs; “always P” = P holds at every step.)

- C1: “Event2 happens and event2 happens.” This is just event2 happens (tautologically repeated). True at step 0, false at later steps where event2 does not occur.
- C2: same as C1; true at step 0, false later.
- C3: “C2 always holds.” Requires C2 to be true at every step. Under the timeline above, C2 is not true at steps after step 0, so C3 is false.
- C4: “C1 holds and C3 holds.” C1 is true at step 0 but C3 is false, so C4 is false (at every step; in particular it is false at step 0 because C3 already fails).
- C5: “C4 always holds.” Since C4 is false at least at step 0, C5 is false.
- C6: “C5 always holds.” False.
- C7: “C6 always holds.” False.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- Because C2 only holds at the initial step, C3 (which demands C2 at every step) fails. That failure cascades: any condition that requires C3 (directly or via “always” nesting) also fails. Thus C7 is False.

Alternative reading note (why one might get the opposite):
- If “event2 happens” is read as “event2 has happened at some point in the past (an accumulating/persistent predicate: ‘event2 has ever occurred’)” then:
  - C2 would be true at every subsequent step once event2 has happened, so C3 would be true, and the chain would make C7 true.
- So the truth of C7 depends on the temporal semantics of “happens” and “always.” Under the standard instantaneous-step reading used above, C7 is False (most likely intended). Under a “has happened sometime in the past” reading, C7 would be True.

Answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (at the initial time).
- Also given: after event1 no other events can happen; and after event2 no other events can happen. So once either event1 or event2 occurs the execution stops (no further events).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- If event1 occurs, the system stays in a terminal state (no further events can occur).
- If event2 occurs, the system also stays in a terminal state.
- Given the initial condition, the actual execution is: event1 occurs and then nothing else ever happens. In particular, event2 does not occur.

3) What does each sub-condition mean? (plain reading)
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" (a material implication from event1 to event2)
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" (C1 is true at every time point)
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" (C2 is true at every time point)
- C4: ""C3 always holds.""
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" (there exists some time at which C4 is true)
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds.""
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds.""

(Here I use the standard temporal readings: ""always"" = true at all times; ""eventually"" = true at some time in the future (including possibly now).)

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
- Evaluate C1 in the actual execution: event1 did happen, but event2 did not. An implication ""if event1 then event2"" with true antecedent and false consequent is false. So C1 is False.
- C2 asserts that C1 is true at all times. Since C1 is already False now (and there are no further events to change truth values), C2 is False.
- Likewise C3 (""C2 always holds"") is False because C2 is False; C4 is False for the same reason.
- C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") asks whether there is some time where C4 is true. C4 is false now and nothing ever changes (no events), so C4 never becomes true; thus C5 is False.
- Then C6 (""C5 eventually holds"") is False for the same reason, and therefore C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is also False.

Conclusion: C7 is False.

(If you use a different formal semantics for ""always""/""eventually"" than the standard temporal ones, say allowing vacuous truth in some nonstandard way, please state that and we can re-evaluate. Under the usual meanings given above, C7 is False.)

Reasoning (brief):
- From the context the system enforces alternation: after event1 the next state has event2, and after event2 the next state has event1; initially event2 occurs, so states alternate 2,1,2,1,...
- C1–C3 are the same implication (event1 implies event2), so they hold under the given rules.
- C4 (C2 or C3) therefore holds; C5 (C1 and C4) holds.
- C6 (""C5 always holds"") is true because the implication holds in every state.

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen (the system is terminal once event1 has occurred).
- After event2, no other events can happen (if event2 ever happens, that also leads to a terminal state).

Because event1 already happened initially and no events can occur after event1, event2 can never occur at any future time.

3) What does each sub-condition mean (and its truth value under the above)?
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" — False (event2 cannot happen after initial event1).
- C2: ""Event2 eventually happens."" — False (same as C1).
- C3: ""C1 holds and C2 holds."" — False ∧ False = False.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" — False. There is no next state after the initial (terminal) state; under standard semantics Xφ (next φ) is false in a terminal state. Even if one allowed a stuttering next state, C3 is false in every reachable state, so C4 remains false.
- C5: ""Event2 eventually happens."" — False (same as C1/C2).
- C6: ""If event2 happens, then C5 holds."" — True. This implication is vacuously true because the antecedent (""event2 happens"") never becomes true; or more generally, whenever the antecedent is false the implication holds.

4) How do these conditions relate and what is C7?
- C7 is ""C4 holds and C6 holds."" That is False ∧ True = False.

Therefore C7 is False.

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially event1 happens (event1 is true at the start).

2) Transition rules
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" → interpret as event1 implies event2 (event1 → event2).
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" → interpret as event2 implies event1 (event2 → event1).
- Together these give event1 ↔ event2 (they are equivalent), and with the initial event1 true we get both event1 and event2 true.

3) Meaning and truth of each C
- C1: event1 or event2 (event1 ∨ event2). Given both events are true, C1 is True.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is True.
- C3: if event2 then C2 (event2 → C2). Since C2 is event1 ∨ event2, this implication is always true (if event2 is true then event1 ∨ event2 is true). So C3 is True.
- C4: C3 always holds. Interpreting “always” as globally true, C4 is True (C3 is true).
- C5: C4 does not hold (¬C4). Since C4 is True, C5 is False.
- C6: C5 holds and event2 happens (C5 ∧ event2). C5 is False, so C6 is False regardless of event2.
- C7: if C1 holds then C6 holds (C1 → C6). We have C1 = True and C6 = False, so the implication is False.

4) Relations summary
- The transition rules force event1 and event2 to hold together; that makes C1 and C2 true.
- C3 is a logical consequence/tautology given C2’s form, so C4 (always C3) is true.
- C5 contradicts C4, so it’s false, which makes any conjunction including C5 (C6) false.
- Since C1 is true but C6 is false, the implication C7 (C1 → C6) is false.

Therefore C7 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: C1 is true (event1 ∨ event2) while C6 is false (C5 is false, so C5 ∧ event2 is false). Thus the implication C7 (C1 → C6) is false."

Answer: C6 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially, event1 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has happened you cannot have event2 afterward).
- After event2, no other events can happen (both events are terminal when they occur).

(Whether there is a “next state” after the initial state depends on the semantics; if a state with a terminal event has no successor, then “next” formulas are false there. The following reasoning does not rely on existence of a successor except where noted.)

3) Meaning of each Ci and evaluation
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is the implication event2 -> event2. In classical logic this is a tautology (P -> P is always true), so C1 holds (true) in every state.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is true, C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" C2 is false, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C1 does not hold."" Same as C2; C4 is false.
- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" C3 is true but C4 is false, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" Since C5 is false now, C5 will not be true in any state (it depends only on the truth of C1/C2/C3/C4 which are not changed by the events), so C6 is false. If your semantics treats “X phi” (next phi) as false at a terminal state with no successor, then C6 is also false for that reason.

4) How the conditions relate (summary)
- Truth values: C1 = True, C2 = False, C3 = True, C4 = False, C5 = False, therefore C6 = False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: C1 (event2 -> event2) is a tautology, so true. Thus C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is false, C3 (""C2 does not hold"") is true, C4 (""C1 does not hold"") is false, and C5 (C3 and C4) is false. Hence C6 (""C5 holds in the next state"") is false (and would also be false under terminal-state semantics since there is no successor)."

Short answer: C6 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happens initially.
- Constraints: ""After event1, no other events can happen."" and ""After event2, no other events can happen.""

2) Transition rules between events
- If event1 happens at some time, then no event (including event2) can happen afterwards.
- If event2 happens at some time, then no event (including event1) can happen afterwards.
- Because event1 already happened initially, there are no further events after that initial moment.

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: event2 does not happen (ever, in the relevant future).
- C2: C1 holds in the next state (i.e., in the state immediately after the current one, event2 does not happen).
- C3: If event1 happens (now), then C2 holds (i.e., if event1 happens then in the next state event2 does not happen).
- C4: C1 holds in the next state (same as C2).
- C5: If C3 holds, then C4 holds (an implication between the two statements).
- C6: C5 does not hold (i.e., the claim that the implication C3 → C4 is false).

4) How these relate and final evaluation
- From the context, since event1 happened initially and ""after event1 no other events can happen,"" event2 cannot happen. Thus C1 is true.
- That same constraint makes C2 true (in the next state, event2 does not happen), so C4 is also true (C2 and C4 are the same).
- C3 is true: whenever event1 happens, the rule guarantees that in the next state event2 does not happen, so the implication holds.
- C5 is the implication ""if C3 then C4."" Both C3 and C4 are true, so C5 is true.
- C6 asserts that C5 does not hold. Since C5 does hold, C6 is false.

Therefore C6 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: C5 (C3 → C4) is true (both C3 and C4 hold), so C6, which asserts ¬C5, is false."

Short answer: C6 is False.

Now the step-by-step reasoning you asked for.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (at the initial state).

2) Transition rules
- After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has occurred, no further events occur in any future state).
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 ever occurs, then a later event2 must occur).

Given the initial condition (event2 already happened) and the first rule, event1 cannot occur now or in any future state.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — this is just the same as ""event1 happens"" (the conjunction is redundant).
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — i.e. C1 is true in every state (a global/always property).
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" — i.e. it is not the case that C1 always holds.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — in the immediate successor state, C3 is true.
- C5: ""C1 always holds"" — identical to C2.
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds"" — both must be true in the current state.

Note: C2 and C5 are the same proposition (both claim C1 holds always).

4) How these relate (evaluation)
- From the initial condition and the rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"", event1 never happens in any state. Therefore C1 is false in every state.
- Hence C2 (C1 always holds) is false, and so is C5 (same as C2).
- C3 = ""C2 does not hold"" is true (because C2 is false).
- C4 = ""C3 holds in the next state"" is true as long as there is a next state with the same situation (no event1 ever happens). Even if there is no next state, that would only make C4 false or undefined — but in either interpretation C5 is still false.
- Finally, C6 = C4 and C5. Since C5 is false, the conjunction is false.

Therefore C6 is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event2 already occurred and prevents any future events, so event1 never occurs; hence C1 is false in all states, so C5 (C1 always holds) is false; therefore C6 = C4 ∧ C5 is false."

Short answer: C7 is False at the initial state.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time 0 (the current state) event2 has happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (so if event2 happens at time t, then event1 happens at time t+1).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event1 at t implies event2 at t+1).
- Thus the system alternates: t0: event2, t1: event1, t2: event2, t3: event1, ….

3) Meaning of each Ci (informally)
- C1: ""event1 or event2 holds"" — i.e. some event holds in the current state.
- C2: ""eventually C1"" — at some (current or future) state C1 will hold.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — at the next time point, C2 is true.
- C4: ""eventually C3"" — at some (current or future) state C3 will be true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" — negation of C4.
- C6: ""C5 holds or event2 happens"" — disjunction of C5 and event2.
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state"" — at the next time point, C6 is true.

4) How the conditions evaluate (at the initial state t0 where event2 holds)
- C1: true (every state has either event1 or event2; in particular t0 has event2).
- C2: true (C1 already holds now, so ""eventually C1"" is true).
- C3: true (since C2 is true in every state, it is true in the next state).
- C4: true (C3 holds now and forever, so ""eventually C3"" is true).
- C5: false (negation of true C4).
- C6: reduces to ""event2 happens"" because C5 is false. So C6 is true exactly at states where event2 holds (t0, t2, t4, …) and false at states with event1.
- C7: asks whether C6 is true in the next state (t1). At t1 event1 holds (not event2), so C6 is false at t1. Therefore C7 is false at the initial state.

Additional note: C7 will be true at states whose next state contains event2 (for example C7 is true at t1, false at t0). But evaluated at the initial state (t0) C7 is False.

Short answer: C7 is False.

I’ll step through your four requested parts and then conclude.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial time (call it t0) event2 has happened (event2 is true at t0).

(Assumption: we read “happens” as a proposition true at the state/time when that event occurs. “Always” means true at all future states; “eventually” means true at some current or future state.)

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (so at some later state after the state where event2 occurs, event1 will occur — in a simple timeline we can take the next state t1 to have event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal: at t1 and all subsequent states there are no further events).

A simple timeline consistent with the rules:
- t0: event2 true
- t1: event1 true
- t2, t3, ...: no events true

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: “Event2 happens or event2 happens.” This simplifies to “event2 happens” (i.e., event2 is true at the current state).
- C2: same as C1 (also “event2 happens” at the current state).
- C3: “C2 always holds.” Means: at every state from now on, C2 is true (i.e., event2 is true at every state).
- C4: “C3 always holds.” Means: at every state from now on, C3 is true. In temporal logic this is equivalent to “event2 is true at every state” (C4 does not add anything beyond C3’s requirement).
- C5: “C1 holds and C4 holds.” Means currently event2 is true AND event2 is true at every state (so overall: event2 holds now and forever).
- C6: “C5 always holds.” Means at every state, C5 holds (so at every state event2 holds now and forever — effectively requiring event2 at every state).
- C7: “C6 eventually holds.” Means there exists some state (now or later) from which C6 holds forever.

4) How these relate and truth evaluation on the timeline
Evaluate on the timeline t0 (event2), t1 (event1), t2+ (no events):

- C1 at t0: true (event2 true at t0).
- C2 at t0: true (same as C1).
- C3 at t0: false, because C2 is not true at t1 (event2 does not hold at t1 or later). So C2 is not true at all future states.
- C4: false (since C3 is false).
- C5: false (C1 true but C4 false, so conjunction false).
- C6: false (C5 does not hold at all states).
- C7: false, because there is no state from which C6 holds forever — C6 never becomes true on the timeline.

Conclusion
Given the stated initial condition and transition rules, C7 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: C6 requires C5 to hold at every state, and C5 requires event2 to hold now and at all future states. But event1 occurs after event2 and no further events occur, so event2 is not true at later states. Thus C5 never holds everywhere, so C6 never holds at any state, hence C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is false."

- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state event1 holds (event1 is true there).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (here interpreted as: if event1 holds in a state, then event2 holds in the next state).
- After event2, event1 must happen (if event2 holds in a state, then event1 holds in the next state).
- With the initial event1, these rules force an alternating sequence: state0: event1, state1: event2, state2: event1, state3: event2, ….

3) Meaning of each sub-condition (evaluated as state formulas unless otherwise marked)
- C1: “Event2 does not happen” — i.e. event2 is false in the current state.
- C2: same as C1 (repeated).
- C3: C2 holds and event2 happens — i.e. (event2 is false) AND (event2 is true) in the same state. That is a contradiction, so C3 is false in every state.
- C4: C3 always holds — requires C3 true in every state. Since C3 is false already, C4 is false.
- C5: C1 holds and C4 holds — requires C4 true; since C4 is false, C5 is false.
- C6: C5 holds in the next state — false because C5 is false in the next state.
- C7: C6 always holds — requires C6 true in every state; since C6 is false (already at the current state), C7 is false.

4) How they relate / final reasoning
- Even though C1/C2 may be true at the initial state (initial state has event1 and not event2), C3 asserts both “event2 does not happen” and “event2 does happen” at the same time, so C3 is impossible and thus false everywhere. That makes C4 false, which cascades to make C5, C6 and finally C7 false.

Therefore C7 is False. (If “after” were read as “eventually” rather than “next”, the alternating requirement still forces event2 to occur sometime after event1 and the same contradiction in C3/C4/C5/... still makes C7 false.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: C3 requires event2 both false and true in the same state, so C3 is impossible (false everywhere). Hence C4 is false, making C5 false, so C6 is false, and therefore C7 (""always C6"") is false."

Step 1 — events and initial condition
- The only events are event1 and event2.
- Initially, event2 has happened.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
From the initial event2 and these rules, events alternate forever: event2 → event1 → event2 → event1 → … . In particular, event1 does occur (indeed infinitely often).

Step 3 — what each Ci says (plain reading / logical form)
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is just a redundant conjunction, equivalent to simply ""event1 happens.""
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" That is C1 ∧ event1. Since C1 already asserts event1, C2 is equivalent to ""event1 happens.""
- C3: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" Same as C2 (a duplicate).
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" So C4 = ¬C3.
- C5: ""If C2 holds, then C4 holds."" So C5 = (C2 → C4).
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" Interpreting this as the claim that C5 is true in the given situation.

Step 4 — how they relate and final truth values
- From the transition rules, event1 does happen, so C1 is true.
- Therefore C2 is true (it reduces to event1), and C3 is true as well (same as C2).
- C4 = ¬C3 is false because C3 is true.
- C5 = (C2 → C4). With C2 true and C4 false, the implication is false (true → false is false).
- C6 asserts that C5 always holds (i.e. that C5 is true). But C5 is false here, so C6 is false.

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (at the initial moment).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2 happens, no other events can happen (so event2 stops further activity).
- If event1 happens, then event2 must happen afterwards (event1 implies event2 will occur).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" (¬event1)
- C2: ""Event1 does not happen."" (same as C1)
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" i.e., eventually (¬event1) holds.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" (¬(eventually ¬event1))
- C5: ""Event1 does not happen."" (same as C1/C2)
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" i.e., (¬(eventually ¬event1)) ∧ (¬event1)
- C7: ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds."" i.e., (¬event1) → [ (¬(eventually ¬event1)) ∧ (¬event1) ].

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
- Because event2 already happened initially and no events can happen after event2, event1 can never happen. So ¬event1 is true. Hence C1, C2, and C5 are true.
- Since ¬event1 is true now and remains true (no events occur to make event1 true), ""eventually ¬event1"" is true. So C3 is true.
- C4 is the negation of C3, so C4 is false.
- C6 is C4 ∧ C5; since C4 is false and C5 true, C6 is false.
- C7 is the implication (C1 → C6). C1 is true but C6 is false, so the implication is false.

Therefore C7 is false.

Short answer: C6 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
Because event2 happened initially, the system is already in a terminal situation and no further events (in particular event1) can occur in any next state.

3) What does each sub-condition mean (and its truth value here)?
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" Given the initial event2 and the rule that after event2 no other events can happen, C1 is false.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" This is the implication C1 → event1. As a logical implication it is true here (either vacuously because C1 is false, or trivially because C1 already asserts event1). So C2 is true.
- C3: Same as C2, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds."" Since both C2 and C3 are true, C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" This is ¬C4. Since C4 is true, C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" This asserts that C5 holds at all (relevant) states. Because C5 is already false (in the current/initial situation), C6 is false.

4) How they relate and final conclusion
- Because C1 is false, C2 and C3 are true (implications with a false antecedent are true). That makes C4 true, so C5 (¬C4) is false, and therefore the claim that C5 always holds (C6) is false.

Summary answer: C7 is False.

Now the step-by-step reasoning you asked for.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state event1 happened (event1 is true in the initial state).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen; after event2, event1 must happen.
- Interpreting “after” as the next-state relation (the usual simple interpretation), the system alternates: if event1 holds in one state then event2 holds in the next, then event1 in the next, and so on. (If “after” were interpreted as “eventually,” the system still forces alternation and the conclusions below remain the same.)

3) Meaning of each sub-condition (using standard temporal operators)
- C1: “Event1 always happens” = G(event1) (globally/eventually-every-state).
- C2: “C1 always holds” = G(C1) = G(G(event1)). Note G(G(p)) is equivalent to G(p), so C2 is equivalent to C1.
- C3: “C2 does not hold” = ¬C2.
- C4: “C3 holds in the next state” = X(C3).
- C5: “C4 holds in the next state” = X(X(C3)) = X^2(C3).
- C6: “C5 eventually holds” = F(C5).
- C7: “C6 does not hold” = ¬C6.

4) How these conditions relate and evaluation
- From the alternation rule and the initial event1, event1 does not hold in every state (every other state is event2). So C1 = G(event1) is false.
- Since C2 ≡ C1, C2 is also false.
- Therefore C3 = ¬C2 is true.
- C3 is a global truth about the trace (¬C2) — its truth does not depend on a particular state — so C3 holds in every state. Hence X(C3) (C4) is true, and X^2(C3) (C5) is true as well.
- Since C5 is already true in the current state, F(C5) (C6) is true.
- C7 = ¬C6 therefore is false.

Conclusion: C7 is False.

Reasoning (concise):
- From the context: event2 has happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen. So event1 never occurs in any future state.
- C1 (event1 in the next state) is false → C2 (not C1) is true.
- C3 (if C2 then event1) has a true antecedent and a false consequent, so C3 is false → C4 (not C3) is true.

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time 0, event2 holds.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must hold in the next state (if event1 at t then event2 at t+1).
- After event2, event1 must hold in the next state (if event2 at t then event1 at t+1).
- From the initial event2 this forces an infinite alternation: t0: event2, t1: event1, t2: event2, t3: event1, ...

3) Meaning of the Ci (using standard temporal operators: X = next, F = eventually, G = always, ¬ = not)
- C1: ¬event2 (event2 does not hold in the current state).
- C2: F C1 (eventually C1 — at some future state ¬event2).
- C3: G C2 (always C2 — from every state eventually ¬event2).
- C4: X C3 (C3 holds in the next state).
- C5: ¬C4 (C3 does not hold in the next state).
- C6: G C5 (always C5).
- C7: F C6 (eventually C6).

4) How they relate / truth values on the timeline
- Timeline: t0: event2 (so C1 false at t0). t1: event1 (so C1 true at t1). This pattern repeats every step.
- C2 (eventually ¬event2): true at t0 because at t1 ¬event2 holds. In fact C2 is true at every state (every state has a future state where event2 is false — the next state whenever event1 holds).
- C3 (always C2): true at t0 because C2 holds at every state.
- C4 (X C3): true at t0 because C3 holds at every state, so in the next state C3 also holds.
- C5 (¬C4): false at t0 (it contradicts C4).
- C6 (always C5): false (C5 is false at least at t0, so it cannot be globally true).
- C7 (eventually C6): false, because C6 is never true at any future state (C6 asserts a global false), so there is no future state where C6 holds.

Therefore C7 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: The system alternates event2/event1 forever, so C2 holds at every state, hence C3 holds, so C4 holds and C5 is always false. Therefore C6 never holds, and C7 (eventually C6) is false."

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events mentioned: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially, event1 happened (so at the start event1 has occurred).
- Additional constraints: after event1, no other events can happen; after event2, no other events can happen.

2) Transition rules between events
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" means once event1 has happened, no further occurrences of any events are possible at any later time.
- Since event1 happens initially, that immediately blocks any later occurrence of event2.
- The statement about event2 (""after event2 no other events can happen"") is irrelevant for future behavior here because event2 never occurs (as shown below).

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — tautologically just says event2 happens (the disjunction is the same twice).
- C2: same as C1 — says event2 happens.
- C3: ""Event2 happens and C2 holds"" — since C2 is ""event2 happens"", C3 is equivalent to ""event2 happens"".
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — means at every time point C3 is true (i.e., event2 must hold at all times).
- C5: ""C1 holds and C4 holds"" — both (event2 happens) and (C3 always holds).
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds"" — at some future time point C5 is true.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds"" — at some future time point C6 is true (i.e., eventually eventually C5).

4) How these conditions relate and evaluation
- From (1) and (2), because event1 happened initially and no events can occur after event1, event2 cannot occur at any later time. There is no information saying event2 also happened initially, so the natural reading is that event2 never happens.
- Therefore C1 and C2 are false (they assert event2 happens).
- C3 is false (equivalent to event2 happens).
- C4 (""C3 always holds"") is false (C3 is false at all times).
- C5 (C1 and C4) is false.
- C6 (""C5 eventually holds"") is false (there is no time at which C5 becomes true).
- C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is false.

Possible ambiguity note: if one allowed simultaneous, initial occurrence of event2 at the same instant as event1, the truth values could change; but under the ordinary interpretation here (event1 initially, and thereafter no events), event2 does not occur and so C7 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: event1 occurs initially and blocks any later events, so event2 never occurs; C1–C6 (which require event2 or its persistence) are false, hence C7 is false."

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- So the system alternates: event2, event1, event2, event1, ... indefinitely. In particular, event1 does occur (indeed infinitely often) after the initial event2.

3) What does each sub-condition mean (and its truth value given the system)?
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" — True (event1 occurs right after the initial event2 and repeatedly thereafter).
- C2: ""Event1 eventually happens."" — same as C1, so True.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" — given C1 and C2 are identical and true, the implication C1 → C2 is True (it is also logically true if they are identical).
- C4: ""Event1 eventually happens."" — same as C1, so True.
- C5: ""Event1 happens or C4 holds."" — since C4 is True, the disjunction is True (regardless of the left disjunct).
- C6: ""If C3 holds, then C5 holds."" — C3 is True and C5 is True, so the implication C3 → C5 is True.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" — since C6 is True, the negation is False.

4) How these conditions relate and final answer
- Because event1 inevitably happens, C1, C2, and C4 are True. Those make C3 and C5 True, which makes C6 True. Therefore C7 (""C6 does not hold"") is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event2 occurs initially and forces event1 thereafter, so C1, C2, and C4 are true; hence C3 and C5 are true and therefore C6 is true. C7 asserts ""C6 does not hold,"" so C7 is false."

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state S0, event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen. So in the next state S1, event1 happens.
- After event1, no other events can happen. That means there is no further event after S1 (either S1 is terminal or any later states have no events).

3) Meaning / truth of each sub-condition (evaluate at states S0 and S1 as needed)
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is P → P, a tautology. True in every state.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is true in every state, C2 is true (globally).
- C3: Same as C1, so true in every state.
- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds."" Both are true, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" This is the negation of C4, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""Event1 happens and C5 holds."" Since C5 is false, C6 is false in every state (even where event1 happens).
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" We check: from the initial state S0 the next state S1 has event1, but C5 is false there, so C6 is false in S1. Therefore C7 is false in S0.

4) How they relate / final conclusion
- Because C1/C3 are tautologies, C2 and C4 are true and C5 is false. That makes C6 false (conjunction with false), so C6 cannot hold in the next state. Thus C7 is False.

(If your semantics treats a non-existent ""next"" state as making ""next φ"" false, the conclusion is the same.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: C6 requires C5 (which is ¬C4). But C4 is true (since C1 and C3 are tautologies and thus always hold), so C5 is false, making C6 false in every state. Therefore C7 (""C6 holds in the next state"") is false."

- C6: ""C2 holds or C5 holds.""

4) How these conditions relate and evaluation
- Because event1 happened initially and rule A says no events can happen after event1, event2 can never occur at any later time. So C1 is false.
- C2 and C3 require C1 to be true; since C1 is false, C2 and C3 are false.
- C4 (""eventually C3"") is false because C3 is never true (no future change can make it true).
- C5 (""always C4"") is false because C4 itself is false (it does not hold now or later).
- C6 is (C2) or (C5) = false or false = false.

Therefore C6 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event1 happens initially and is terminal (no further events can occur), so event2 can never occur. Hence C1 is false, so C2 (which requires C1) is false; C5 is also false. Therefore C6 = C2 or C5 = false."

Answer: C6 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event1 occurs, no other events can happen.
- After event2 occurs, no other events can happen.
Thus each event is terminal: once either happens, the run ends (no further events).

Because event1 already happened initially, the system is already in a terminal state and no further events (including event2) can occur.

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" Given the initial event1 and the rule that no events can happen after event1, event2 cannot occur. So C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" C1 is false, even though event1 happens, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is false, C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 already holds now, so ""eventually holds"" is true.
- C5: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" Same as C2, so false.
- C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" C4 is true but C5 is false, so C6 (the conjunction) is false.

4) How they relate (short derivation)
- Initial event1 → no further events → event2 cannot occur.
- Therefore C1 is false → C2/C5 false → C3 true → C4 true → C6 (true AND false) = false.

Final: C6 is False.

False

Answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules between events
- After event1, event2 must happen (i.e., event1 ⇒ eventually event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e., event2 ⇒ eventually event1).
- With the initial event2, these rules force an infinite alternation: event2, event1, event2, event1, ... So both events occur (and will continue to occur) repeatedly.

3) What each sub-condition means
- C1: If event1 happens, then event2 happens. (Matches the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"".)
- C2: If event1 happens, then event2 happens. (Same as C1 — a duplicate.)
- C3: If C1 holds, then C2 holds. Given C1 and C2 are the same statement, C3 is true whenever C1 holds.
- C4: C3 always holds. This claims C3 is true at all times. Given the definitions, C3 is indeed true (C1 ⇒ C2 holds), so C4 is true.
- C5: C4 does not hold. This is the negation of C4; since C4 is true, C5 is false.
- C6: C5 eventually holds. This says ""at some future time C4 will not hold."" Because C4 is true and nothing in the given dynamics makes C4 stop holding, C5 never becomes true, so C6 is false.
- C7: Event2 happens and C6 holds. This requires both (a) event2 happens and (b) C6 holds.

4) How the conditions relate and final evaluation
- From the system rules C1 and C2 are true; hence C3 is true and C4 (""C3 always holds"") is true.
- C5 is the negation of a true statement, so C5 is false; therefore C6 (""C5 eventually holds"") is false.
- Event2 does happen (initially and repeatedly), so the first conjunct of C7 is true, but the second conjunct C6 is false.
- A conjunction with one false conjunct is false. Therefore C7 is false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event2 does happen, but C6 (""C5 eventually holds"") is false because C4 is true and stays true, so the conjunction in C7 is false."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (so the system starts after event2).

Step 2 — transition/temporal rules
- After event2, no other events can happen.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
So both event1 and event2 are terminal; because event2 has already happened initially, no further events (including event1) can occur.

Step 3 — meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautological implication (p → p). It is true in all states (in particular true when event1 never happens).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This asserts that the previous tautology is false.
- C3: same as C1 (so it is true).
- C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds."" This requires C2 true and C3 true simultaneously — i.e., it requires C1 to be both false (C2) and true (C3), which is impossible.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" This requires C4 to be true in every state; since C4 is impossible, C5 is false.
- C6: same as C1 (true).
- C7: ""C5 holds and C6 holds."" So C7 requires both C5 true and C6 true.

Step 4 — how they relate and final truth values
- C1: True (tautology).
- C2: False (it claims C1 is false).
- C3: True.
- C4: False (requires a contradiction).
- C5: False (C4 does not hold, so it cannot always hold).
- C6: True.
- C7: False, because C5 is false (even though C6 is true).

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened.
- Transition rules force alternation: after any event1 there must be an event2 later, and after any event2 there must be an event1 later. Starting from the initial event2 this yields an infinite alternating sequence event2, event1, event2, event1, ...

2) Transition rules restated
- After event1, event2 must happen (event1 ⇒ eventually event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (event2 ⇒ eventually event1).
- Together these ensure both events occur repeatedly (infinitely often), alternating after the initial event2.

3) Meaning of each Ci (informal)
- C1: “event2 happens or event1 happens” (i.e. event1 ∨ event2).
- C2: “If event1 happens, then C1 holds” (event1 ⇒ (event1 ∨ event2)).
- C3: “C2 always holds” (□C2).
- C4: “C3 eventually holds” (◇C3).
- C5: “C4 does not hold” (¬C4).
- C6: “C5 eventually holds” (◇C5).
- C7: “C6 always holds” (□C6).

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- C2 is a propositional tautology: event1 ⇒ (event1 ∨ event2) is always true whenever the implication is evaluated. So C2 holds at every point.
- Therefore C3 (“C2 always holds”) is true.
- If C3 is always true then C4 (“C3 eventually holds”) is also true (something that holds always certainly holds at some future point).
- C5 asserts ¬C4. Since C4 is true, C5 is false (¬C4 is false).
- C6 asserts ◇C5 (that C5 holds eventually). Because C5 is false and will never become true (it contradicts facts already deduced), C6 is false.
- C7 asserts □C6 (that C6 always holds). Since C6 is false, C7 is false.

Thus C7 is False.

Short answer: C6 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state event2 happened (event2 is true at time 0).

2) Transition rules
- Rule A: ""After event1, event2 must happen."" (If event1 occurs at some state, then at some later state event2 must occur.)
- Rule B: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" (Once a state occurs in which event2 holds, in all subsequent states no events occur.)

3) What the sub-conditions mean
- C1: event2 happens and event1 happens (both hold in the same state).
- C2: C1 holds in the next state (i.e. at the immediately following state, both event2 and event1 hold).
- C3: same as C2 (the statement is repeated).
- C4: C3 eventually holds (there exists some future state where C1 holds in the next state).
- C5: C2 holds and C4 holds (both are true at the current state).
- C6: C5 always holds (C5 is true at every state).

4) How these relate and why C6 is false
- Because event2 holds initially and rule B says no events can happen after event2, no future state after the initial one can make event1 or event2 true again. Thus the next state after the initial state cannot satisfy C1 (both event1 and event2).
- Therefore C2 is false in the initial state (C1 does not hold in the next state). Consequently C5 (which requires C2) is false in that state.
- C6 asserts C5 holds in every state; since C5 is false at least at the initial state, C6 is false.

(Edge cases: allowing event1 to be true simultaneously with event2 in the initial state still does not help: even if C1 were true at time 0, C2 would require C1 at time 1, but rule B forbids any events at time 1, so C2 is false. Either way C5 fails somewhere, so C6 cannot be true.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event2 holds initially and rule B forbids any events in subsequent states, so C2 (C1 holding in the next state) is false at the initial state. Hence C5 is false there, so C6 (""C5 always holds"") cannot be true."

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened in the initial state.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: After event1 happens, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, all future states have no events).
- Rule B: After event2 happens, event1 must happen at some later point.

Given the initial state already has event1, Rule A means no events (in particular no event2) can occur in any future state.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state"" (X event2).
- C2: ""Eventually C1 holds"" (F C1) — i.e., at some future time there is a state whose next state has event2, equivalently event2 occurs at some time ≥1 in the future.
- C3: F C2 — ""eventually (eventually (next event2))""; still asserts that event2 occurs at some future time.
- C4: F C3 — another nesting of eventually; still requires event2 at some future time.
- C5: G C4 — ""always C4"": at every time, C4 must hold.
- C6: G C5 — ""always C5"".
- C7: G C6 — ""always C6"".

Note: Nesting F many times still expresses that event2 occurs at some (possibly later) time; nesting G many times is redundant (G G φ ≡ G φ), but if the inner φ is false at the current time, G φ is false.

4) How do these conditions relate and what follows?
- Because event1 already happened and Rule A forbids any further events, event2 can never occur in any future state.
- Therefore C1 is false (event2 is not true in the next state).
- Since C1 is never true, C2 (F C1) is false, and by the same reasoning C3 and C4 are false.
- C5 = G C4 is false because C4 is already false now (G requires it to hold at all times).
- Consequently C6 and C7 are false as well.

So C7 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event1 already occurred and forbids any further events, so event2 can never occur; thus the nested eventualities fail and the always-conditions built on them are false."

Short answer: C6 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initially, event1 has happened (so at the current start point event1 has already occurred).
- Rule: after event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- Rule: if event2 occurs, then afterwards event1 must occur.

2) Transition rules (summary)
- event1 being terminal means no event (including event2) can occur at any time after the initial point.
- The rule ""after event2, event1 must happen"" only applies if event2 occurs; it imposes that event1 must follow any occurrence of event2.

3) What the C-conditions mean
- C1: ""event2 eventually happens"" — there exists a future time (from now) when event2 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — at some future time, C1 is true (i.e., at some later time it becomes true that event2 will eventually happen).
- C3: same as C2 in the hypothesis (it duplicates ""C1 eventually holds"").
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens"" — a conditional proposition.
- C5: ""C4 holds and event2 happens"" — conjunction of C4 and event2.
- C6: ""C2 holds or C5 holds"" — disjunction of C2 and C5.

4) How they relate and truth values
- Because event1 has already happened and no events can happen after it, event2 cannot occur in the future. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2 and C3 assert that someday C1 will be true; since C1 is never true in the future, both C2 and C3 are false.
- C4 is the implication (C3 → event2). An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true, so C4 is true.
- C5 = C4 ∧ event2 is false because event2 is false (true ∧ false = false).
- C6 = C2 ∨ C5 = false ∨ false = false.

Therefore C6 is False. (Note: this conclusion assumes the natural reading that ""Initially, event1 happened"" places us after event1 and that ""eventually"" refers to times after that point. If an alternative timeline where event2 already occurred earlier is intended, further clarification would be needed.)

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened at the start.

2) Transition rules
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur next.
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur next.
- So the system alternates: event1, event2, event1, event2, ... (event1 occurs at the initial time and at every other step thereafter).

3) Meaning and truth of each sub-condition
Interpret each Ci as a propositional/statement-level claim evaluated under standard logic:

- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is the implication event1 → event1, which is a logical tautology (always true). So C1 is True.

- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is True, the statement ""C1 does not hold"" is False. So C2 is False.

- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" C2 is False, so ""C2 does not hold"" is True. So C3 is True.

- C4: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" Same as C1, so C4 is True.

- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" Both C3 and C4 are True, so C5 is True.

- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" Because C5 is True, this is False. So C6 is False.

- C7: ""C6 always holds."" C6 is False (and, given the above, remains false), so the claim that C6 always holds is False.

4) How they relate
- C1 and C4 are tautologies and therefore true regardless of the event dynamics.
- C2 negates C1 and is false; C3 negates C2 and is therefore true.
- C5 bundles two true claims (C3 and C4) so it is true; C6 negates C5 and is false.
- C7 asserts that the false statement C6 is always true — that assertion is false.

Conclusion: C7 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False.

Reason: C5 is true (since C3 and C4 are true), so C6 (""C5 does not hold"") is false; therefore C7 (""C6 always holds"") is false."

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning (interpreting ""after"" as ""in the next state"" and ""always"" as the usual G/“globally” meaning):

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial state S0: event1 happened (so event1 = true in S0). event2 is not said to hold in S0, so treat event2 = false in S0.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen in the next state. So if event1 is true in a state, then event2 is true in the immediately following state.
- After event2, event1 must happen in the next state. So if event2 is true in a state, then event1 is true in the immediately following state.
- From S0 (event1), the rules force S1 with event2 true; then S2 with event1 true, and so on (they alternate).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 always happens"" (globally G event2). This requires event2 to be true in every state.
- C2: same as C1 (duplicate).
- C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds"" — true in a state if either event2 is true in that state or C2 (global event2) is true.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" — true in the current state if C3 is true in the immediate next state.
- C5: same as C1/C2 (duplicate).
- C6: ""C4 holds or C5 holds"" — true if either C4 is true now or C5 (global event2) is true.
- C7: ""C1 holds and C6 holds"" — true only if both C1 (global event2) and C6 hold.

4) How they relate and final evaluation (at the initial state S0)
- C1 (global event2): false, because S0 does not have event2 (event2 is not true in every state).
- C2 and C5: same as C1 → false.
- C3 at S0: ""event2 or C2"" → event2 is false in S0 and C2 is false, so C3 is false in S0. (In S1, event2 is true, so C3 would be true there.)
- C4 at S0: ""C3 holds in the next state"" → in S1 event2 is true so C3 is true in S1, hence C4 is true in S0.
- C6 at S0: ""C4 or C5"" → C4 is true, C5 false, so C6 is true.
- C7 at S0: ""C1 and C6"" → C1 is false while C6 is true, so C7 is false.

Therefore C7 is False. (Note: even though event2 will occur repeatedly after the initial event1, it is not true in every state globally because the initial state lacks event2, so any claim that event2 “always” holds is false.)

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially.

2) Transition rules
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur following the initial event2).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur after event1).
Thus both events occur (at least once): event2 occurred initially and event1 follows it, so event1 also happens. The rules also imply a repeating alternation, but one round is enough for the next steps.

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" Given the initial event2 and the rule that after event2 event1 must happen, C1 is true.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" This is logically true (C1 includes event1), so C2 holds.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is a valid implication (a logical consequence of C1), C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This contradicts C3, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" This is the same as C2 and so is true.

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- C6 is ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" That is false AND true, which is false. Therefore C6 is False.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has just happened (so at the initial moment event2 is true).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2 happens, event1 must happen next.
- After event1 happens, event2 must happen next.
So the system produces an infinite alternating sequence: event2, event1, event2, event1, … . Thus event2 occurs infinitely often but not at every moment.

Step 3 — what each sub-condition means (and simple simplifications)
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" Logically this is just event2. (C1 ⇔ event2.)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" So C2 ⇔ ¬C1 ⇔ ¬event2.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" So C3 ⇔ ¬C2 ⇔ C1 ⇔ event2.
- C4: ""Event2 happens and C3 holds."" So C4 ⇔ event2 ∧ C3 ⇔ event2 ∧ event2 ⇔ event2.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" So C5 ⇔ always(event2) — i.e. event2 holds at every moment from now on.
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" So C6 ⇔ eventually(always(event2)) — there is some future point after which event2 holds at every moment.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" So C7 ⇔ eventually(eventually(always(event2))) — equivalently, at some point in the future there is a later point from which event2 holds always.

Step 4 — how they relate and final truth value of C7
- From the transition rules we have event2 only at every other step (it alternates with event1). Therefore:
  - always(event2) is false (there is no time from which event2 holds at every subsequent moment).
  - consequently C5 is false at all times.
  - if C5 never becomes true, then eventually(C5) (C6) is false, and eventually(C6) (C7) is also false.
- Therefore C7 is False.

Concise summary: C7 is False (event2 happens infinitely often but not always, so the ""always(event2)"" claim never becomes true).

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially.
- Constraints: ""After event1, no other events can happen"" and ""After event2, no other events can happen."" So either event1 or event2, when it occurs, is terminal: no further events can occur afterward.

2) Transition rules between events
- Because event1 has happened initially and it is terminal, no other events (including event2) can occur at any later time.
- Thus event2 never happens in this execution.

3) Meaning of each sub-condition (interpretation)
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (True in this run.)
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" i.e. ¬C1 (equivalently: event2 does happen). (False.)
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" (There is a future state where C2 is true.) (False, since C2 is never true.)
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" i.e. ¬C3. (True.)
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" i.e. ¬C4. (False.)
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" (False, because C5 is false now and remains false.)
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" (Requires C6 true in every state; since C6 is false now, C7 is false.)

4) How they relate (propagation)
- From the initial facts we get C1 = True. Then C2 = False (negation), so C3 = False (it never becomes true), hence C4 = True, C5 = False. C6 asks about C5 in the next state — but C5 is false in all states, so C6 = False. Therefore C7 (""C6 always holds"") is False.

(If you use a different semantic model — e.g. a finite-trace semantics where there is no ""next state"" after the terminal event — statements that quantify over a next state may be treated differently. Under the usual infinite-trace or standard state-based semantics assumed above, the conclusion C7 = False holds.)

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event2 and event1.
- Initial condition (at state s0): event2 happened.
- Transition rules: after event2 (so at or after s0) event1 must happen; after event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 occurs, later states have no events).

One convenient timeline:
- s0: initial state where event2 has happened.
- s1: event1 happens (required after event2).
- s2 and later: no events (because after event1 nothing more happens).

2) Transition rules between events
- event1 must occur after event2 (so s1 exists where event1 holds).
- After event1 (from s1 onward) no further events occur (s2, s3,... have no events).

3) Meaning of each C-claim
- C1: ""event2 happens and event1 happens."" True on the timeline overall (both occur: event2 at s0, event1 at s1).
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then C1 holds."" This is a state formula: in a state it asserts the implication (event1 → C1).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" At a state X, C3 means C2 is true at the immediate successor of X.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Negation of C3 at the given state.
- C5: same as C1.
- C6: ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds."" A conditional on the same state.
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" At the current state it asserts C6 is true at the immediate successor.

4) How the conditions relate and evaluation (state-by-state)
We evaluate from s0 (initial):

- At s1 (the next state after s0) we check C6 because C7 says ""C6 holds in the next state"".
- To know C6 at s1 we need to know C4 at s1.
- C4 at s1 says ""C3 does not hold at s1"". C3 at s1 says ""C2 holds at s2"".
- Evaluate C2 at s2: C2 is the implication (event1 → C1). At s2 no events occur (by the rule “after event1 no other events”), so event1 is false at s2. An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true, so C2 is true at s2.
- Therefore C3 is true at s1 (because C2 holds at s2). Hence C4 (""C3 does not hold"") is false at s1.
- C6 at s1 is (if C4 then C5). Since C4 is false at s1, the implication is true (false antecedent → implication true).
- Thus C6 holds at s1.
- Therefore C7 (""C6 holds in the next state"", i.e. at s1) is true at s0.

Conclusion: C7 is True.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
True.

Reason: Let s0 be the initial state (event2), s1 the next state (event1), s2 thereafter (no events). At s2 event1 is false, so C2 (event1 → C1) is vacuously true at s2; hence C3 (C2 holds in the next state) is true at s1, so C4 (¬C3) is false at s1. Therefore C6 (C4 → C5) is true at s1 (false antecedent), so C7 (""C6 holds in the next state"", i.e. at s1) is true at s0."

Short answer: C6 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules between events
- After event2 occurs, event1 must occur sometime afterwards.
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur sometime afterwards.
So the system forces an alternation: event2 → event1 → event2 → event1 → … (event2 occurs repeatedly, including the initial occurrence).

3) Meaning of each Ci
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" This is true because event2 has already happened initially, and by the transition rules it will also happen again after any subsequent event1.
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" Since C1 is true, C2 is true (an OR where one disjunct is true).
- C3: same as C2, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" Since C3 holds, C4 is false.
- C5: ""Event1 happens or C4 holds."" Event1 does happen (it must follow the initial event2), so C5 is true.
- C6: ""If C2 holds, then C5 holds."" This is an implication. Antecedent C2 is true and consequent C5 is true, so the implication is true.

4) How the conditions relate and final result
- C1 true ⇒ C2 true ⇒ C3 true ⇒ C4 false.
- Event1 is guaranteed by the rules, so C5 true.
- Therefore C2 ⇒ C5 is satisfied; C6 is True.

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event2 and event1.
- Initial condition: at the initial state, event2 has happened.

(Assumption clarified: “eventually” means “at some state from now on (including the current state)”; “next” means one step forward.)

2) Transition rules
- Immediately after (in the next state following) any state where event2 occurs, event1 must occur.
- After event1 has occurred, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal; no future state will have event2 again).

3) Meaning of each sub-condition
- C1, C2, C3: “Event2 eventually happens.” At the initial state these are true because event2 already happened in the initial state.
- C4: C2 and C3 hold — true (both are true).
- C5: C1 and C4 hold — true (C1 true and C4 true).
- C6: “C5 eventually holds.” At the initial state this is true because C5 already holds now.
- C7: “C6 holds in the next state.” We must evaluate C6 in the state immediately after the initial state.

4) How the conditions relate and evaluation of C7
- In the next state (by rule), event1 holds and no further events occur. From that next state, event2 will not happen in the future, so “event2 eventually happens” is false there. Therefore C1, C2, C3 are false in the next state, so C4 and C5 are false there.
- C6 in that next state says “C5 eventually holds”; since C5 is false in that next state and never becomes true afterwards (event2 never reoccurs), C6 is false in the next state.
- Hence C7 (“C6 holds in the next state”) is false.

Conclusion: C7 is False under the stated rules and the standard temporal semantics described above.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: in the next state event1 has occurred and event2 will never occur again, so ""event2 eventually happens"" (C1–C3) is false there, making C5 false forever after. Thus C6 is false in the next state, so C7 is false."

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur at some future point after event1).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Thus the timeline must include event1 (already happened) and then at some later time event2 occurs; after that nothing else happens.

3) What each sub-condition means
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen"" — i.e. event2 never occurs.
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — everywhere/at all times, event2 never occurs (equivalent to C1 in effect).
- C3: same as C1: ""Event2 does not happen.""
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds"" — since C2 and C3 both assert event2 never happens, C4 is just the claim that event2 never happens.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" — at some time in the future the claim 'event2 never happens' becomes true.
- C6: ""C5 always holds"" — at every time, it will be the case that eventually 'event2 never happens' holds.
- C7: ""If event1 happens, then C6 holds.""

4) How they relate and truth values under the given rules
- From the transition rules event2 must happen (after event1). Therefore the proposition ""event2 does not happen"" (C1 and C3) is false.
- If C1 is false, C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false. So C4 (C2 or C3) is false.
- If C4 is false at all times, then C5 (""eventually C4 holds"") is false (there is no time at which C4 becomes true).
- If C5 is false, C6 (""C5 always holds"") is false.
- Finally, C7 is ""if event1 happens then C6 holds."" Since event1 does happen (given) and C6 is false, the implication is false.

Therefore C7 is false.

(If you were using a different reading of ""Event2 does not happen"" — e.g. ""has not yet happened at the current instant"" rather than ""never happens"" — the evaluation of the temporal operators would change. Under the usual interpretation here (""does not happen"" = never occurs), the conclusion above holds.)

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happens at the start (immediately).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" That makes event1 terminal: once event1 has happened, no further events (including event2) can occur afterward.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" Interpreted: if event2 occurs at some time t, then there must be an occurrence of event1 at some time > t.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: (event1 happens) AND (event2 happens).
- C2: NOT C1 (i.e., it's not the case that both event1 and event2 happen).
- C3: Eventually C2 (at some time in the future C2 holds). In temporal logic, ""eventually"" is satisfied if the proposition holds now or at some later time.
- C4: Always C3 (C3 holds at every time).
- C5: Eventually C4.
- C6: NOT C5.
- C7: (event2 happens) AND C6.

4) How these conditions relate and evaluation
- Because event1 happens initially and is terminal, no events can occur after it. Therefore event2 can never occur at any time.
- Thus C1 is false (event2 does not happen).
- C2 = NOT C1 is true (immediately and forever).
- C3 (""eventually C2"") is true — C2 already holds now, so ""eventually"" is satisfied.
- C4 (""always C3"") is true — since C2 is true at all times, C3 holds at all times.
- C5 (""eventually C4"") is true — C4 holds now.
- C6 = NOT C5 is false.
- C7 = (event2 happens) AND C6 is false because event2 does not happen (and C6 is false).

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened (i.e., at the initial time point event1 occurred).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1 occurs, event2 must occur at some later point (event2 is required following event1).
- After event2 occurs, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 3 — what each sub-condition means
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Given the context, this asserts that there is some point in the execution where event1 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" So C2 asserts that event1 does not eventually happen.
- C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds."" Conjunction of event1 occurring and ""event1 does not eventually happen.""
- C4: Same as C3 (the statement is repeated).
- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" So C5 requires both C3 and C4 to be true (they are the same conjunct repeated).

Step 4 — how they relate and truth-value of C5
- From the initial condition, event1 has happened, so C1 is true.
- C2 is the negation of C1, so C2 is false.
- Any conjunction that includes C2 (e.g., C3 and C4) is therefore false. So C3 is false and C4 is false.
- C5 is the conjunction C3 ∧ C4; since both conjuncts are false, C5 is false.

Conclusion
C5 is False.

(Aside: if one used a nonstandard semantics where ""eventually"" excludes the current/initial instant, you would need to check whether event1 occurs later again. Under the given rules, after event1 the required next event is event2 and then nothing else, so event1 does not occur again; but the context explicitly says event1 happened initially, so the usual reading makes C1 true and the above conclusion stands.)

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened (it is true at the start).
- Additional constraints: after event1, event2 must happen; after event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule R1: If event1 occurs, then event2 occurs (event2 must follow event1).
- Rule R2: After event2 occurs there are no further events (terminal state).
These are global rules describing the behavior after event1 and after event2.

Step 3 — meaning and truth-value of each Ci (under the given context)
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This matches R1, so C1 is true.
- C2: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" (same as C1) so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is true, C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Because C3 is false, C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" Because C4 is false, C5 is false.
- C6: ""C1 holds or C5 holds."" C1 is true, so the disjunction is true; C6 is true.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" C6 is true now because C1 is a global rule (it is not merely a temporary fact), so C6 is (and remains) true. Therefore C7 is true.

Step 4 — how they relate (brief)
- C1 and C2 assert the same global rule; that makes C3–C5 false because they negate or assert the falsity of that rule.
- C6 is true because of C1. Since C1 is a system-wide rule, C6 holds in all states, so C7 (that C6 always holds) is true.

Conclusion
C7 is True.

(If one instead interpreted ""always"" as requiring that the truth of C6 could never be revoked later and allowed C1 to be only a current, non-global fact, the answer could differ. But given the context that ""after event1, event2 must happen"" is a rule, the natural reading makes C1 global and thus C7 true.)

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (it is true at the start).

Step 2 — transition rules
- Rule A: After event2 happens, no other events can happen (so no event can occur at any later time once event2 has happened).
- Rule B: After event1 happens, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs then event2 must occur afterwards at some point).

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" (a claim that event2 never happens)
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" (event1 occurs AND event2 does not happen)
- C3: same as C1 (""Event2 does not happen"")
- C4: same form as C2 (""Event1 happens and C1 holds"")
- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" (both C3 and C4 true)
- C6: ""C2 holds and C5 holds."" (both C2 and C5 true)

Step 4 — how they relate and truth evaluation
- From the initial condition, event2 has happened. Therefore the statement ""Event2 does not happen"" (C1 and C3) is false.
- Because C1 is false, any condition that requires C1 (C2 and C4) is false (conjunction with a false conjunct is false).
- Since C3 and C4 are both false, C5 (""C3 and C4"") is false.
- C6 is ""C2 and C5""; since both C2 and C5 are false, C6 is false.

Conclusion
- C6 is False.

(If one tried an alternate timeline where event1 occurred before the initial moment and event2 later, Rule B would still be satisfied because event2 did happen; but the given statement ""Initially, event2 happened"" most directly makes ""event2 does not happen"" false, so the result above stands.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: The initial fact ""event2 happened"" makes C1 (""event2 does not happen"") false. Hence C2 and C4 (which require C1) are false, so C5 is false, and therefore C6 (""C2 and C5"") is false."

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event2 and event1.
- Initial condition: event2 happens initially.

2) Transition rules between events?
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur at some point after the initial event2).
- After event1 happens, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

From these rules we can conclude that event1 does indeed happen (and once it does the run ends).

3) What each sub-condition means (plain reading)
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" (i.e. at some time event1 occurs.)
- C2: ""Event1 eventually happens."" (same as C1)
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" (implication: C2 ⇒ event1 happens)
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" (C3 is true invariantly)
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" (¬C4)
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" (¬C5)
- C7: ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds."" (C1 ⇒ C6)

4) How they relate (truth values and reasoning)
- From the transition rule, event1 does eventually happen. Therefore C1 is True.
- C2 is the same statement as C1, so C2 is True.
- C3 is the implication (C2 ⇒ event1 happens). Since C2 is True and event1 indeed happens, C3 is True.
  (Even if interpreted more generally, an implication whose consequent actually holds when the antecedent holds is True.)
- C4 asserts C3 always holds. C3 is true in the actual system/run, so C4 is True (under the ordinary reading that ""always"" means the property is true in the system/run).
- C5 says C4 does not hold; since C4 is True, C5 is False.
- C6 says C5 does not hold; since C5 is False, C6 is True.
- C7 is the implication (C1 ⇒ C6). C1 is True and C6 is True, so C7 is True.

Therefore C7 is True.

Note on ambiguity: if one used different formal temporal/logical semantics for ""always"" or interpreted ""event1 happens"" vs ""event1 eventually happens"" differently, some intermediate readings could differ; under the plain temporal reading given above the conclusion stands.

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state (call it t0) event2 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen in the next state. (If current state has event1, the next state has event2.)
- After event2, event1 must happen in the next state. (If current state has event2, the next state has event1.)
- Thus the system alternates: t0: event2, t1: event1, t2: event2, t3: event1, ….

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" (i.e., at the current state, the immediate next state has event1).
- C2: same as C1 (identical statement).
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — C2 is true at every state (an invariant claim).
- C4: again ""Event1 happens in the next state"" (same as C1/C2).
- C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds"" (either the invariant C3 is true, or at the current state C4 is true).
- C6: ""C1 holds or C5 holds"" (either C1 is true now, or C5 is true now).
- C7: ""C6 always holds"" — C6 is true at every state.

4) How do these conditions relate, and is C7 true?
- C1, C2, C4 are the same proposition: ""next state is event1"".
- Because of the alternation, ""next state is event1"" is true in states where the current event is event2, and false in states where the current event is event1.
- C3 (""C2 always holds"") would require every state to have the next state be event1. That is false because in states with event1 the next state is event2.
- C5 = C3 or C4 reduces to C4 in practice (since C3 is false globally), so C5 has the same truth value as C4 at each state.
- C6 = C1 or C5 reduces to just ""next state is event1"" (both disjuncts are the same), so C6 is true in event2 states and false in event1 states; it is not true at every state.
- Therefore C7 (""C6 always holds"") is false — C6 does not hold in every state (it fails in states where the current event is event1).

Answer: C5 is False (given the usual reading). Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially. No statement says event1 happened initially.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" -> event1 is terminal: once it occurs, nothing else can occur afterward.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" -> event2 is terminal too.
So once either event occurs, no further events can occur after it.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: event1 happens AND event2 happens.
- C2: event1 happens AND event2 happens. (same as C1)
- C3: C1 holds AND C2 holds — equivalent to C1 (and thus requires both events to have happened).
- C4: same as C3/C1.
- C5: C3 OR C4 — equivalent to saying both event1 and event2 happened.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other (and to the context)?
- Because event2 happened initially and event2 is terminal, no other events can happen after that; in particular, event1 cannot happen after event2. Under the usual reading (only event2 is given as having happened), event1 did not happen. Therefore C1 and C2 are false, so C3 and C4 are false, and hence C5 is false.

Note on an alternative interpretation: if one allowed simultaneous occurrences at the initial moment and the facts had stated that both event1 and event2 happened initially, then C5 would be true. But with the provided statements (""Initially, event2 happened"" and both events are terminal), the correct conclusion is C5 = False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event2 happened initially and both events are terminal (no other events can occur after either), so event1 cannot occur; therefore C5 (which requires both event1 and event2) is false."

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (at the start).

2) Transition rules
- After event2 occurs, event1 must happen (i.e., event2 → eventually event1).
- After event1 occurs, no further events can happen (event1 is terminal).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True, because event2 already happened initially.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is the negation of C1, so C2 is False.
- C3: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Same as C1, so True.
- C4: ""Event2 eventually happens."" Same again, True.
- C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" Since C3 and C4 are True, C5 is True.
- C6: ""If event2 happens, then C5 holds."" Event2 does happen (initially) and C5 holds, so the implication is True.
- C7: ""C2 holds and C6 holds."" This is (False) AND (True) → False.

4) How they relate / final remark
- C2 contradicts C1/C3/C4, so C2 must be false given the initial occurrence of event2.
- Because C2 is false, any conjunction that requires C2 (like C7) is false regardless of C6.

Assumption note: I treated ""event2 eventually happens"" as satisfied by the initial occurrence. If you intended ""event2 happens at some strictly later time (after the initial moment),"" say so and I can re-evaluate.

Reasoning (sketch):
- From the rules and the initial event2 at time 0, event2 and not-event2 alternate every step: event2 at t0, not-event2 at t1, event2 at t2, etc.
- C1 = ""event2 does not happen"" is true at odd times (t1, t3, ...), false at even times (t0, t2, ...).
- C2 = ""C1 holds in the next state"" is C1(t+1), so C2 is true at even times, false at odd times (it alternates).
- C3 = ""C2 always holds"" is false everywhere because C2 alternates and is not true at all future times.
- Then C4, C5 (which are statements about C3 shifted) are false everywhere, C6 = ""C5 always holds"" is false everywhere.
- C7 = ""C6 eventually holds"" asks whether C6 is true at some future time; since C6 is never true, C7 is false."

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened initially.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (so the next state after an event1 state is an event2 state).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so the next state after an event2 state is an event1 state).
- Together these rules enforce an alternating sequence event1, event2, event1, event2, ... (so both events occur infinitely often).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
Interpreting the phrases in standard temporal/logical way:
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" This is p → p with p = (event2). That is a tautology — true in any state where implication is evaluated.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Since C1 is true in every state, it is true in the next state, so C2 is true now.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Because C2 already holds now (and certainly holds at the next state), C2 holds at some future time — so C3 is true.
  (Even if “eventually” were taken to mean strictly future, C2 holds in the next state by the model, so C3 still true.)
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" This is the negation of C3. Since C3 is true, C4 is false.
- C5: ""Event2 happens and C4 holds."" This is (event2) ∧ C4. Since C4 is false, C5 is false regardless of whether event2 happens.
- C6: ""If event2 happens, then event2 happens."" Same as C1, a tautology, so C6 is true.
- C7: ""C5 holds and C6 holds."" Conjunction of C5 (false) and C6 (true) is false.

4) How they relate / final evaluation
- Truth values: C1 = True, C2 = True, C3 = True, C4 = False, C5 = False, C6 = True.
- Therefore C7 = False.

Short answer: C6 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: Initially, event1 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event2, event1 must happen (whenever event2 occurs, the next required occurrence is event1).
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal: once event1 occurs, no further events occur).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state."" (a claim about the immediate next state)
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" (i.e. C1 ∧ event1)
- C3: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" (the same as C2)
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" (C2 ⇒ C3)
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" (C4 is true in every relevant state)
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" (negation of C5)

4) How do these conditions relate and what is the truth of C6?
- C2 and C3 are identical formulas (C2 ≡ C3). Therefore C2 ⇒ C3 is logically valid (a tautology): whenever C2 holds, C3 holds (indeed they are the same).
- Because C4 is a tautology, the statement ""C4 always holds"" (C5) is true.
- C6 asserts the negation of C5. Since C5 is true, C6 is false.

Extra note: Whether C1 itself is true or false cannot be determined from the given context alone (the initial/transition rules do not force or forbid ""event1 happens in the next state"" in every scenario). That uncertainty does not affect the above: even if C1 is false (making C2 and C3 false), C4 is still true (vacuously), so C5 holds and C6 is still false.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False. C2 and C3 are identical, so C4 (C2 ⇒ C3) is always true; thus C5 holds, and C6 (¬C5) is false."

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened.
- Additional rules: after event1 no other events can happen; after event2 no other events can happen. So once either event occurs the system has no successor states. In particular the initial state is a terminal state (no next state) and event1 did not occur there.

(Assume standard linear temporal semantics where
- ""always φ"" (G φ) means φ holds in the current and all future states,
- ""next φ"" (X φ) requires a successor state and φ holds there (X φ is false if there is no successor),
- ""eventually φ"" (F φ) means φ holds now or at some future successor.)

2) Transition rules between events
- Both event1 and event2 are terminal: after either one, there are no further transitions. Since event2 happened initially, there are no successors of the initial state.

3) What each Ci means (interpreting in temporal logic)
- C1: ""Event1 always happens"" ≡ G(event1).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" ≡ X C1.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" ≡ F C2.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" ≡ F C3.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" ≡ F C4.
- C6: ""C5 always holds"" ≡ G C5.
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state"" ≡ X C6.

4) How they relate and truth values in this system
Evaluate all formulas at the initial (and only) state s0, where event2 occurred and there are no successors:

- event1 is false at s0, so C1 = G(event1) is false.
- C2 = X C1 is false because there is no next state (X formulas are false at terminal states).
- C3 = F C2 is false: C2 is false now and there are no future states to make it true.
- C4 = F C3 is false for the same reason.
- C5 = F C4 is false.
- C6 = G C5 is false because C5 is false in the current (and only) state.
- C7 = X C6 is false because there is no next state (and even if there were, C6 is already false here).

Therefore C7 is False.

Note: If you use a nonstandard semantics where X φ at a terminal state is treated differently (e.g., undefined or vacuously true), the answer could change; with the usual LTL interpretation above, C7 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: the initial state is terminal where event1 is false, so C1 is false, which makes C2–C6 false; X C6 (C7) is false at a terminal state (no successor)."

Short answer: C6 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened (call that state s0).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"": any state where event1 occurs, the immediate next state must have event2.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"": any state where event2 occurs, the immediate next state must have event1.
- Together with the initial event2, this forces an infinite alternation: s0: event2, s1: event1, s2: event2, s3: event1, ….

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — this is just the same disjunct twice, so C1 ≡ ""event2 happens (now).""
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state"" ≡ ""event2 holds in the next state.""
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" ≡ ""at some future state, event2 holds in that state's next state"" (i.e. there exists a future state from which the next state has event2).
- C4: ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds"" ≡ whenever event2 holds now, at some future state there will be a state whose next state has event2.
- C5: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — this is identical to C2.
- C6: ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds"" ≡ (C4 → C2).

4) How do these conditions relate, and evaluation on the alternating run
- Timeline values (first few states):
  s0: event2 (C1 true at s0), next state s1 has event1 so C2 is false at s0.
  s1: event1 (C1 false at s1), next state s2 has event2 so C2 is true at s1.
  s2: event2 (C1 true at s2), next state s3 has event1 so C2 false at s2.
  and so on (C2 alternates true/false, C1 true at even-index states).
- C3 at s0: true, because at s1 (a future state) C2 holds. In fact whenever event2 occurs (s0, s2, …) there is a later state (the immediately following state) from which the next state contains event2, so C3 holds at every state where needed.
- C4: true at s0 (and true wherever it needs to be), because whenever event2 happens the alternating pattern guarantees some future state witnessing C2, so the implication in C4 is satisfied.
- C5 (same as C2) at s0: false (because the next state s1 has event1, not event2).

Conclusion about C6:
- C6 is the implication (C4 → C5). At the initial state s0 we have C4 true but C5 false. Therefore the implication C6 is false at s0 (so C6 does not hold in this model).
- Hence C6 is False.

Reasoning (brief):
- From the rules: states alternate e1, e2, e1, e2, ... with e1 true at the initial state.
- C1 (""e1 does not happen"") is false at the initial state (and at every state where e1 occurs).
- C2 (e2 → C1) holds at every state: if e2 holds then e1 does not hold in that same state, and if e2 doesn't hold the implication is vacuously true.
- Hence C3 (""eventually C2"") and C4 (""C3 always holds"") are true.
- C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is therefore false, so C6 (""C5 holds in the next state"") is false, and C7 (""C6 always holds"") is false."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has already happened (the system starts in a state after event2).
- Additional facts: after event2 no other events can happen; similarly after event1 no other events can happen. So both events are terminal, and we start in the terminal state produced by event2.

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event2: no further events occur (the run is stuck/quiescent).
- After event1: likewise no further events occur.
- Because the run starts after event2, there are no further transitions from the initial state.

Step 3 — meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event2 eventually happens.” (In the initial state this is true because event2 already happened.)
- C2: “C1 always holds.” Interpreted as: in every state along the execution, C1 is true (i.e., from every state, event2 will eventually occur).
- C3: “C2 does not hold.” (¬C2)
- C4: same as C3 (¬C2)
- C5: “C3 holds and C4 holds” i.e. (¬C2) ∧ (¬C2), which is equivalent to ¬C2.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final truth value
- At the initial state C1 is true because event2 has already happened.
- But C2 requires that from every state (including states after the initial one) event2 will eventually occur. After the initial state we are in the post-event2 terminal state and no further events will happen, so event2 will not occur again; therefore C1 is false in those later states.
- Thus C2 is false. That makes C3 true and C4 true. Therefore C5 (C3 ∧ C4) is true.

Answer: C5 is True.

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial moment, event1 has happened.
- Global constraints given: (a) after event1 occurs, event2 must happen (event2 is inevitable sometime after event1); (b) after event2 no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

A convenient timeline consistent with the constraints: event1 holds at time t0, event2 holds at some t1 ≥ t0, and nothing happens after t1.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- From event1 the system must eventually go to a state where event2 happens.
- Once event2 has happened, there are no further events (terminal state).

3) What does each sub-condition mean? (standard temporal meanings: ""eventually"" = holds now or at some future time; ""always"" = holds at every time)
- C1: ""Event1 happens or event2 happens."" — a proposition true whenever either event1 or event2 holds at the current moment.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" — at some time (including now) C1 is true.
- C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" — true if either event2 holds now or C2 is true.
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" — logical negation of C3 at the current moment.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" — C4 is true at every moment in time.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" — negation of C5 (i.e., it is not the case that C4 holds always).
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" — negation of C6.

4) How these conditions relate and evaluation on the timeline
Evaluate at the initial moment t0 (where event1 is true):

- C1: True, because event1 holds at t0.
- C2: True, because ""eventually C1"" is satisfied immediately (C1 is true now).
- C3: True, because C2 is true (so ""event2 or C2"" holds).
- C4: False, it asserts the negation of C3.
- C5: False, because C4 is already false at t0, so C4 is not true at every moment.
- C6: True, since C5 does not hold.
- C7: False, since it asserts ""C6 does not hold"" but C6 does hold.

Therefore C7 is False. (If you use a different convention for ""eventually"" that excludes the current moment, re-evaluation would be needed, but with the standard semantics above the conclusion stands.)

Short answer: C5 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened in the initial state.
- Additional facts: “After event1, no other events can happen.” (So once event1 has occurred, every subsequent state has no events.) The rule about event2 is irrelevant here because event2 never occurs.

2) Transition rules between events
- If event1 occurs at some state, there are no further event occurrences after that point (the system enters a state(s) where no events happen).
- Similarly for event2, but since event2 does not occur, that rule never comes into play.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event1 does not happen.” (This is a proposition about a particular state.)
- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” i.e. in the immediate successor state, event1 does not happen.
- C3: “C2 always holds.” i.e. in every state, the next-state proposition C1 holds.
- C4: same as C3 (a duplicate): “C2 always holds.”
- C5: “C3 holds or C4 holds.”

4) How the conditions relate and evaluation
- At the initial state: C1 is false because event1 did happen initially.
- But by the premise “after event1, no other events can happen,” in the immediate next state event1 does not happen. Therefore C2 is true at the initial state.
- From that point forward every future state has no events (so event1 never happens again). Therefore C2 is true not only at the initial state but at every state (for each state the next state has no event1). Hence C3 is true, and C4 (the same statement) is also true.
- C5 = (C3 or C4) is therefore true (both disjuncts are true).

Remark about semantics: this reasoning assumes standard state-based temporal semantics where “next” and “always” are evaluated along the (possibly stuttering) future and terminal states either have a self-loop or are treated so that “next” is meaningful. Under those usual assumptions the conclusion above holds.

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened initially.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, no further events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no further events can happen (event2 is terminal).
So the system starts in the state where event2 has occurred and remains in that (terminal) state forever.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" — trivially the same disjunct twice, so C1 is true exactly when event2 holds. Given the initial condition, C1 is true.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold"" — the negation of C1. Since C1 is true, C2 is false.
- C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds"" — since event2 holds, C3 is true.
- C4: ""C3 always holds"" — C3 is true now and remains true in all future states (we never leave the terminal state where event2 holds), so C4 is true.
- C5: ""Event1 happens and C4 holds"" — C4 holds but event1 does not happen (only event2 happened), so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 always holds"" — because C5 is false now and there are no transitions that can make it true later, C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds"" — since C6 is false now and will never become true, C7 is false.

4) How they relate / final result
- The truth values propagate as above: C1 true → C2 false → C3 true → C4 true → C5 false → C6 false → C7 false.
- Therefore C7 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event2 holds forever, so C5 (event1 ∧ C4) is never true, hence C6 is never true and therefore C7 (""eventually C6"") is false."

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened (at least once).

Step 2 — transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (so any occurrence of event1 is followed later by an occurrence of event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so any occurrence of event2 is followed later by an occurrence of event1).
- Starting from the initial event2, the rules force event1 to occur afterward, and then event2 again, etc. In particular, both event2 and event1 do happen (at least once).

Step 3 — meaning and truth of each sub-condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" True (initial event2 plus the rule after event2 ⇒ event1).
- C2: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" Same as C1, so True.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" C2 is True and event1 does happen, so the implication is True.
- C4: ""C1 holds or C3 holds."" Both C1 and C3 are True, so C4 is True.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" False, because C4 holds.
- C6: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" Same as C1/C2, so True.
- C7: ""C5 holds or C6 holds."" C5 is False, C6 is True, so the disjunction is True.

Step 4 — how they relate and final answer
- Many of the Cs repeat the same fact that both events occur. C4 is true, making C5 false; C6 is true, so C7 is true because the OR requires only one true disjunct.

Reasoning (brief):

- C1 and C2 (¬event1) are false at t0, true at t>=1.
- C3 (event2 ∨ ¬event1) is false at t0 (event2 false and event1 true), true at every t>=1.
- C4 (X C3) is true at t0 because C3 holds at t1; in fact C4 is true at every time.
- C5 (C1 ∨ C4) is therefore true at t0 (via C4) and true at all times.
- C6 (◇C5) is true (C5 already holds now), and hence C6 holds at every time.
- C7 (□C6) is true because C6 holds at all times.

Step 1 — events and initial conditions
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 is true.
- From the context: after event2, event1 must happen. So event1 is true (it must occur after the initial event2).
- Also: after event1 no other events can happen (not needed for the final truth value here, but it just says nothing happens after event1).

Step 2 — transition rules between events
- Rule A: If event2 happens, then event1 happens. (Given: “After event2, event1 must happen.”)
- Rule B: If event1 happens, no further events can happen. (Given: “After event1, no other events can happen.”)

Step 3 — meaning of each Ci (introduce shorthand E1 = “event1 happens”, E2 = “event2 happens”)
- C1: ¬E1 (event1 does not happen).
- C2: E2 → C1 (if event2 happens, then C1 holds).
- C3: C2 → E1 (if C2 holds, then event1 happens).
- C4: C3 ∨ E1 (C3 holds or event1 happens).
- C5: ¬E1 (same as C1).
- C6: C4 ∨ C5 (C4 holds or C5 holds).
- C7: ¬C6 (C6 does not hold).

Step 4 — how they relate and truth evaluation
- From the context, E2 is true (initially) and the rule after event2 gives E1 true. So E1 = True.
- C1 = ¬E1 is therefore False. (So C1 and C5 are both False.)
- C2 = E2 → C1. Since E2 is True and C1 is False, the implication is False. So C2 = False.
- C3 = C2 → E1. Material implication with a false antecedent is True, so C3 = True.
- C4 = C3 ∨ E1. C3 is True (and E1 is also True), so C4 = True.
- C6 = C4 ∨ C5. C4 is True, so C6 = True.
- C7 = ¬C6. Since C6 is True, C7 = False.

Answer: C7 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: E2 is true, so E1 must be true. Thus C1 and C5 (¬E1) are false, C2 (E2→C1) is false, C3 (C2→E1) is true, C4 = C3 ∨ E1 is true, C6 = C4 ∨ C5 is true, so C7 = ¬C6 is false."

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time 0 (initial state) event1 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So once event1 has occurred the system is quiescent: no further events (neither event1 nor event2) occur thereafter.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen."" Meaning if event2 ever occurs at some time, then event1 must occur afterward (or eventually after that point). Given the first rule and that event1 already occurred initially, event2 cannot occur at any time in this scenario (there is no time before the initial state to place event2, and no time after because no events can occur after event1).

3) What does each sub-condition mean and what is its truth value?
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True (it already happened initially).
- C2: same as C1. True.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" This is equivalent to C2 → (event2 happens). Since C2 is true, C3 would require event2 to hold. But event2 never happens (see rule 1), so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C1 holds and C3 holds."" C1 is true but C3 is false, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" C4 is false now and will remain false (because event2 never happens), so C5 is false.
- C6: ""Event2 happens or C5 holds."" Both disjuncts are false, so C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" Since C6 is false in all states (never becomes true), C7 is false.

4) How they relate and final conclusion
- Because event1 occurs initially and that forbids any further events, event2 never occurs. That makes C3 false (the implication's consequent fails despite the true antecedent), which cascades to make C4, C5, C6 false, and hence C7 (eventually C6) false.

Therefore C7 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event1 already occurs initially and thereafter no events can happen, so event2 never occurs. C2 is true, so C3 (C2 → event2) is false (true antecedent, false consequent). That makes C4–C6 false in all states, so C6 never becomes true and thus C7 (""eventually C6"") is false."

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened at the start (so event2 occurs).
- Also given: after event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Rule A: Whenever event1 happens, event2 must happen afterward (i.e., event1 ⇒ eventually event2).
- Rule B: Whenever event2 happens, no further events can happen after that (event2 is terminal).

Given the initial condition that event2 already happened, Rule B implies there are no events at any later time; in particular, event1 cannot happen at any time.

3) What does each sub-condition mean and what is its truth value?
Interpret ""happens"" as ""occurs at some point in the execution"", ""eventually"" as ""at some future point"", and ""always"" as ""at all times"".

- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens."" (redundant disjunction) This is true because event2 did happen initially.
- C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" Requires event1 to happen. But event1 cannot happen (event2 already happened and is terminal), so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event1 happens."" Same requirement as C2 (needs event1), so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 never holds, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 holds and event1 happens."" C4 is false (and event1 cannot happen), so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 always holds."" C5 is not true now (and never will be), so ""always C5"" is false.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" C6 never becomes true, so C7 is false.

4) How do these conditions relate to each other?
- They form a chain where each later condition depends on event1 occurring and on the previous condition. Because event2 happens initially and is terminal, event1 is impossible, so every condition that requires event1 (directly or indirectly) fails. Only C1 (which just asserts event2) is true; all later Cs (C2..C7) are false. Hence C7 is False.

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened (the current/initial state is one where event2 is the last event).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen (so every time event1 occurs, event2 follows).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so every time event2 occurs, event1 follows).
- Together these force an infinite alternation: event2 → event1 → event2 → event1 → ...

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" (There is a future point where event1 occurs.)
- C2: same as C1.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" (An implication between the two identical eventuality claims.)
- C4: ""Event1 eventually happens."" (same as C1/C2)
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" Interpreted as: from every reachable state, C4 is true — i.e., it is always true that event1 will eventually occur (formally G(F event1)).
- C6: ""C3 holds and C5 holds.""
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" (negation of C6)

4) How do these conditions relate and what is their truth value?
- From the transition rules and the initial event2, event1 will happen next, so C1 (and hence C2 and C4) is true.
- C3 is the implication between identical true statements, so C3 is true.
- Because the system alternates indefinitely, from any state event1 will occur again in the future, so C5 (always C4) is true.
- Therefore C6 = C3 ∧ C5 is true.
- C7 is the negation of C6, so C7 is false.

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning.

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time/state 0, event2 happened.

2) Transition rules
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" — so at the next state after the one where event2 occurred, event1 holds. (Call states S0, S1, S2: event2 at S0, event1 at S1.)
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — once event1 happens (S1) there are no further events in S2, S3, ... (a terminal/no-event tail).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
Interpreting the statements as state formulas and simple temporal operators:
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is the tautology event1 → event1, so C1 is true in every state.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is also true in every state.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold"" i.e. ¬C2. Since C2 is true everywhere, C3 is false in every state.
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds"" i.e. C1 → C3. Because C1 is true, C4 is equivalent to C3, hence C4 is false in every state.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" (X C4). Since C4 is false in every state, C5 is false in every state (no state has a next state where C4 is true).
- C6: ""C5 always holds"" (G C5). Because C5 is false at states (including the initial ones), C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 eventually holds"" (F C6). Since C6 is never true at any state, there is no future state where C6 holds, so C7 is false.

4) How the conditions relate and conclusion
- C1 and C2 are tautologies → true everywhere.
- That makes C3 false, which makes C4 false, which forces C5 false, then C6 false, and finally C7 false.
- The particular event transition rules (event2 → event1 → terminal) do not change the truth of the tautologies, so the chain of truth/falsehood above is unchanged.

Therefore C7 is False.

Summary answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning and answers to your numbered questions.

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened at the initial moment. So event1 is true at the initial state. Because ""after event1, no other events can happen,"" no further events (including event2) can occur after that initial moment. Therefore event2 never occurs in the run.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — event1 is terminal: once it has happened, the system cannot produce any other events.
- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" — similarly, if event2 ever happened it would be terminal. But given the initial condition, event2 does not occur (it cannot occur after event1 and there is no earlier time when it happened).

3) What does each sub-condition mean? (interpreting ""happens"" as “has happened” or “ever happens”, and ""eventually"" as the usual temporal operator F — true now or at some future point)
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Formally: event2 ⇒ event1. Given event1 already happened, this implication is true (and also true vacuously because event2 never occurs).
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is ¬C1.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" This is ¬C2.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" This is C3 ∨ event1.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" F(C4).
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" F(C5).
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" ¬C6.

4) How do these conditions relate and what are their truth values?
Start from event facts:
- event1: True (happened initially).
- event2: False (never happens).

Evaluate the Ci:
- C1 = (event2 ⇒ event1). Since event1 is true (and event2 is false), C1 is True.
- C2 = ¬C1 = False.
- C3 = ¬C2 = True.
- C4 = C3 ∨ event1 = True ∨ True = True.
- C5 = F(C4). Since C4 holds now, ""eventually C4"" is True.
- C6 = F(C5). Since C5 holds now, C6 is True.
- C7 = ¬C6 = False.

Therefore C7 is False.

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has already happened in the initial state.
- Additional constraint: after event1 no other events can happen (so the initial state is effectively terminal — there are no later event occurrences).

2) Transition rules between events
- Rule A: If event2 happens, then event1 must happen afterwards (i.e., any occurrence of event2 must be followed by event1).
- Rule B: If event1 happens, no other events can happen after it (event1 is terminal).

Combining these with the initial condition: since event1 already happened initially and no events can happen after event1, no occurrence of event2 can occur anywhere in the future of the trace.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: “Event2 eventually happens.” — false (because no events can occur after the initial event1).
- C2: “Event2 eventually happens.” — same as C1, so false.
- C3: “If C1 holds, then C2 holds.” — this is the implication (C1 ⇒ C2). Because C1 and C2 are identical propositions, the implication is trivially true (and in particular an implication with a false antecedent is true).
- C4: “Event2 eventually happens.” — same as C1, false.
- C5: “C4 always holds.” — means in every state C4 is true. C4 is false in the initial state, so C5 is false.
- C6: “C3 holds and C5 holds.” — True ∧ False → False.
- C7: “C6 holds in the next state.” — requires that there is a next state where C6 is true. There is no next state after the initial state (because event1 is terminal), and even if one attempted to evaluate it, C6 is false. Under standard next-state semantics (next is false if there is no successor), C7 is false.

4) How the conditions relate
- The initial terminal event1 rules out any occurrence of event2, so any condition asserting “event2 eventually happens” (C1, C2, C4) is false.
- That makes any “always” requirement on those (C5) false as well.
- C3 is vacuously/tautologically true.
- C6 is false because it conjoins a true and a false.
- C7 asks about C6 in the next state; since there is no next state (and C6 is false even if there were), C7 is false.

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial state, event2 has happened (event2 is true initially).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- If event1 happens at some state, then event2 must happen later (i.e., event1 → eventually event2).
- Once event2 happens, no other events can happen afterwards (i.e., after event2, the system has no further events).

Because event2 already happened initially and after event2 no events can happen, event1 cannot occur at any future state (and there is no prior history to allow event1).

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens"" (there exists a future state where event1 occurs).
- C2: same as C1.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens"" (both: event1 eventually happens, and event2 happens).
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" (in the immediate successor state, C3 is true).
- C5: ""C4 always holds"" (in every state from now on, C4 is true).
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state"" (in the next state, C5 is true).
- C7: ""C1 holds and C6 holds"" (both C1 and C6 true).

4) How these conditions relate and are evaluated given the context
- From the initial facts, event2 is true now and no events can happen after it; therefore event1 never happens. So:
  - C1 (event1 eventually happens) is False.
  - C2 is also False (same as C1).
  - C3 requires C2 to be True and event2 to happen; C2 is False, so C3 is False.
  - C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is False (C3 is false now and nothing will change).
  - C5 (""C4 always holds"") is False because C4 is already false.
  - C6 (""C5 holds in the next state"") is False.
  - C7 is ""C1 and C6"": both conjuncts are false, so C7 is False.

Therefore C7 is False.

- After event1, event2 must happen (so event1 → event2).
- After event2, no other events can happen (sequence ends after event2).

From these rules and the initial fact, we can deduce that event2 does indeed happen (because event1 happened and that forces event2).

Step 3 — meaning and truth of each sub-condition
Evaluate each Ci given that event1 = True and event2 = True.

- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" True (both events occur).
- C2: ""Event2 happens or C1 holds."" True (event2 is True, and C1 is also True).
- C3: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" True (same as C1).
- C4: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" True (same as C1/C3).
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" True, because C3 is True and C4 is True, so the implication holds.
- C6: ""Event2 happens and C5 holds."" True (event2 is True and C5 is True).
- C7: ""C2 holds or C6 holds."" We'll determine this below.

Step 4 — how the conditions relate and final conclusion
- We have C2 = True and C6 = True, so the disjunction C2 or C6 is True.
- Therefore C7 is True.

Final answer: C7 is True.

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning (with the natural reading “after X, Y must happen” = whenever X occurs, Y will occur later/next):

1) Events and initial condition
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 has happened in the initial state.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
Together (with the initial event1) these force event1 and event2 to occur repeatedly (they alternate), so event1 happens now and will happen again later (in fact infinitely often).

3) Meaning of each Ci and evaluation
- C1: “Event1 eventually happens.” True — event1 already happened initially (and will happen again).
- C2: “Event1 eventually happens.” (same as C1) True.
- C3: “If event2 happens, then C2 holds.” This is an implication. Since C2 is true (globally/from any relevant state), the implication C3 is true. Also, the transition rules guarantee that whenever event2 occurs, event1 will occur afterward, so C2 holds after any event2.
- C4: “C3 does not hold.” This is the negation of C3. Since C3 is true, C4 is false.
- C5: “C4 eventually holds.” Because C4 is false now and never becomes true (there is no reason for C3 to become false later), C5 is false.
- C6: “C1 holds and C5 holds.” This conjunct is false because C5 is false (C1 is true but both are required).
- C7: “C6 holds in the next state.” Since C6 is false now, it cannot be true in the next state under the given rules; therefore C7 is false.

4) How they relate (quick chain)
- Initial event1 ⇒ C1 and C2 are true.
- C2 true ⇒ C3 (if event2 then C2) is true.
- C3 true ⇒ C4 (C3 does not hold) is false ⇒ C5 (eventually C4) false.
- C1 true and C5 false ⇒ C6 false ⇒ C7 false.

Conclusion: C7 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: From initial event1, C1 and C2 are true. Thus C3 (""if event2 then C2"") is true, so C4 (¬C3) is false and hence C5 (eventually C4) is false. Therefore C6 (C1 ∧ C5) is false, so C7 (""C6 holds in the next state"") is false."

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Two events: event1 and event2.
- Initially, event1 happened.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
So the system forces an alternation: event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 → ...

3) Meaning of the Ci
- C1: “Event2 always happens” (read as a global/“always” claim: event2 holds at all times).
- C2: C1 holds or event2 happens (C1 ∨ (event2 happens at some time)).
- C3: same as C1.
- C4: C2 ∨ C3.
- C5: not C4 (¬C4).
- C6: same as C1.
- C7: C5 ∧ C6.

4) How they relate and evaluation
- From the alternation, event2 does occur (immediately after the initial event1). So the proposition “event2 happens (at some time)” is true.
- But “event2 always happens” (C1/C3/C6) is false if “always” means globally true at every time, because there are times when event1 holds instead of event2 (so event2 is not true at all times).
- Evaluate the Ci:
  - C1 = false, C3 = false, C6 = false.
  - “event2 happens” = true, so C2 = C1 ∨ event2 = false ∨ true = true.
  - C4 = C2 ∨ C3 = true ∨ false = true.
  - C5 = ¬C4 = false.
  - C7 = C5 ∧ C6 = false ∧ false = false.

Therefore C7 is False.

(If you instead intended “always happens” to mean “eventually always occurs” or “occurs at least once,” some truth values would shift — say if “always” were read as “occurs at least once,” then C1/C3/C6 would be true and the rest would change — tell me if you meant a different semantics.)

Short answer: C7 is True.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happened.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen. So given event1 occurred, event2 will occur.
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).

From (1) and (2) we know both event1 and event2 occur (event1 already occurred; event2 follows and then nothing else).

3) What does each sub-condition mean (and its truth value)?
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" True (both events occur).
- C2: ""If event2 happens, then C1 holds."" This is the implication (event2 → C1). Antecedent (event2) is true and consequent (C1) is true, so C2 is True.
- C3: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" Same as C1, so True.
- C4: ""C2 holds or C3 holds."" At least one of C2 or C3 is true, so C4 is True.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is True, C5 is False.
- C6: ""If event2 happens, then C5 holds."" This is the implication (event2 → C5). Antecedent (event2) is true but consequent (C5) is false, so C6 is False.
- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" Since C6 is False, C7 is True.

4) How these conditions relate to each other (summary)
- The facts force event2 to occur, which makes C1 and C3 true immediately.
- That makes C2 true (because the implication has a true antecedent and true consequent), so C4 is true.
- C5 being the negation of C4 is false.
- C6 asserts that event2 implies C5; because event2 is true but C5 is false, C6 is false.
- C7 is the negation of C6, so C7 is true.

Conclusion: C7 is True.

True.

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event2 and event1.
- Initially event2 happened.
- Rule: after event2, event1 must happen.
- Rule: after event1 no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).

From the context, event1 does happen (because it must after event2).

2) Transition rules (summary)
- event2 -> event1 will occur (so event1 occurs at/after the initial state).
- Once event1 has occurred, nothing else happens afterwards.

3) What each C means
- C1: “event1 does not happen.” (a claim that event1 never occurs)
- C2: “event1 does not happen.” (same as C1)
- C3: “If C2 holds, then event1 happens.” (C2 → event1)
- C4: “If C1 holds, then C3 holds.” (C1 → C3)
- C5: “C4 always holds.” (a temporal/global claim that C4 is true in all states)
- C6: “C5 does not hold.” (¬C5)
- C7: “C6 holds in the next state.” (next-state( C6 ))

4) How these relate / truth values
- Because the context forces event1 to occur, the proposition “event1 does not happen” (C1 and C2) is false. So:
  - C1 = False
  - C2 = False
- C3 is the implication (C2 → event1). In classical (material) logic an implication with a false antecedent is true, so C3 = True.
- C4 is (C1 → C3). Since C1 is false, that implication is also vacuously true, so C4 = True.
- C5 says “C4 always holds.” Given that C4 is a logical implication that holds (indeed it is true regardless because C1 is false), C5 is true (there is no state in which C4 would fail under these facts), so C5 = True.
- C6 is “C5 does not hold,” so C6 = False (it contradicts C5).
- C7 says C6 holds in the next state. Since C6 is false (now and there is no reason it would become true next), C7 = False.

Conclusion: C7 is False.

(If you use a non-classical interpretation of implication or a different temporal reading of “always,” the verdict could change; the above uses standard material implication and the usual reading of “always.”)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event2 forces event1, so C1 and C2 are false; thus C3 and C4 are vacuously true, C5 holds, C6 (¬C5) is false, hence C7 (C6 in the next state) is false."

Short answer: C6 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event1 happened (so the very first state has event1).

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- ""After event2, no other events can happen."" → any state reached where event2 has occurred is terminal (no further events).
- ""After event1, no other events can happen."" → any state reached where event1 has occurred is terminal.
Because event1 already happened initially, the initial state is terminal: no further events can occur from the start.

3) What does each sub-condition mean (and its truth value under the above)?
- C1: ""Event2 happens in the next state.""
  - False. The initial state already has event1 and is terminal, so there is no next-state event2.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens.""
  - False, because C1 is false (the conjunction is false).
- C3: same as C2 (it repeats): False.
- C4: ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds.""
  - True (vacuously). Event2 never happens, so the implication with a false antecedent is true.
- C5: ""C2 holds and C4 holds.""
  - False, because C2 is false (conjunction false).
- C6: ""C5 always holds.""
  - False. C5 does not hold now (it is false in the initial/only relevant state), so it is not true that C5 holds at all times.

4) How the conditions relate to each other (summary):
- Because event1 happened initially and no events can occur after event1, event2 cannot occur at any future point. That makes C1 false and knocks out C2/C3/C5. C4 is vacuously true, but C6 (requiring C5 to always hold) is false.

Therefore C6 is False.

Short answer: C6 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: initially event2 happened. The context also says ""after event2, no other events can happen."" So the system is in the state reached immediately after event2 and no further event occurrence is possible.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
- Thus both event1 and event2 are terminal events. In particular, because we are in the state after event2, there are no transitions that would make event1 occur later.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" (interpreted as: event1 holds/occurs in the current and all future states).
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (the property C1 is true in the immediate next state).
- C3: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (same as C2).
- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" (the statement C3 is false).
- C5: ""C2 holds and C4 holds."" (both C2 true and C4 true).
- C6: ""C5 holds and event1 happens."" (both C5 true and event1 occurs).

(If one uses a different formal semantics for ""always"" or for ""next"" when no events occur, results can vary; below is the natural reading.)

4) How do these conditions relate, and which are true/false here?
- Given initial event2 and the rule that after event2 no events can happen, event1 does not and cannot occur now or in the future. Therefore:
  - C1 is false (event1 does not always happen).
  - C2 is false (C1 is not true in the next state).
  - C3 is false (same as C2).
  - C4 is true (it correctly states that C3 does not hold).
  - C5 = C2 and C4 is false because C2 is false (you cannot have both C2 true and C4 true).
  - C6 = C5 and event1 happens is false because C5 is false (and event1 also does not happen).

Thus C6 is false.

Note: if you adopt a different formal convention (e.g., treating ""C1 holds in the next state"" as vacuously true when there is no next state), some intermediate truth values might differ. Under the standard reading used above (there is a current state after event2 and no future event1), C6 is definitely false.

Short answer: C6 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event1 happens at the initial moment.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- After event1, event2 must happen (so the next moment after an event1 is event2).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so they alternate: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...).

3) What does each sub-condition mean (interpreting ""happens"" as “holds at the current moment” and ""always"" as “holds at every moment”)?
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens"" — effectively just ""event1 happens"" at the current moment. This is True at the initial moment.
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" — meaning event1 holds at every moment. Given the alternation, event1 does not hold at the moments when event2 occurs, so C2 is False.
- C3: same as C2 (it is ""C1 always holds"") — False for the same reason.
- C4: same as C1 — True at the initial moment.
- C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds"" — since C4 is True, C5 is True (disjunction).
- C6: ""C2 holds and C5 holds"" — since C2 is False and C5 is True, the conjunction C6 is False.

4) How the conditions relate and final result
- Because C2 (and C3) claim that event1 holds at every moment but the rules force alternation, C2 is false. C5 is true only because C4 is true. The conjunction C6 = C2 ∧ C5 is therefore False.

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step reasoning

1) Events and initial conditions
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 happened in the initial state.

2) Transition rules
- After event1, event2 must happen (i.e. whenever event1 occurs, event2 will occur afterward/at some following state).
- After event2, event1 must happen (i.e. whenever event2 occurs, event1 will occur afterward/at some following state).
(I'm interpreting ""after"" as “must happen at some future state” — the usual eventuality reading. The conclusion below is the same if ""after"" instead means ""in the next state"".)

Because event2 happened initially and after event2 event1 must happen, event1 will hold at some future state (so “eventually event1” is true from the initial state).

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: event1 happens or event1 happens — trivially equivalent to “event1 happens”.
- C2: same as C1, also “event1 happens”.
- C3: C1 and C2 — equivalent to “event1 happens” (both conjuncts are the same).
- C4: C3 eventually holds — “eventually event1”.
- C5: C4 holds in the next state — in the next state, “eventually event1” holds.
- C6: event1 happens or C5 holds — either event1 holds now, or in the next state it is true that eventually event1.
- C7: C6 does not hold — the negation of C6.

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- From the initial event2 and the rule “after event2, event1 must happen,” we get that eventually event1 holds now. So C4 is true in the initial state.
- If “eventually event1” is true now, it will also be true in the next state (because the required occurrence of event1 is in the future and remains in the future or immediate at that next state). Thus C5 is true.
- Since C5 is true, C6 (event1 now or C5) is true (even though event1 does not hold in the initial state, the C5 disjunct does).
- C7 is the negation of C6, so C7 is false.

Therefore C7 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: initial event2 implies eventually event1 (by the rule ""after event2, event1 must happen""), so C4 holds and hence C5 holds. That makes C6 true (event1 now or C5), so its negation C7 is false."

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: in the initial state event2 has already happened.

2) Transition rules (given):
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal — once it has occurred, there are no further events).
- After event1, event2 must happen (if event1 occurs, then some later state must have event2).

3) What each sub-condition means (take ""the next state"" to mean the state immediately after the initial state):
- C1: event2 happens in the next state.
- C2: event2 happens in the next state (same as C1).
- C3: C1 and C2 (so: event2 happens in the next state and also event2 happens in the next state — equivalent to C1).
- C4: C3 holds and event1 happens (requires C3 true and an occurrence of event1).
- C5: event2 happens in the next state (again same as C1).
- C6: C5 always holds (C5 is true in every relevant state / globally).
- C7: C4 holds and C6 holds.

4) How they relate and final evaluation:
- Because event2 already happened in the initial state and no events can happen after event2, the next state cannot have any event, so event2 does not happen in the next state. Therefore C1 (and C2 and C5) are false.
- C3 (C1 ∧ C2) is false. C4 (C3 ∧ event1) is false. C6 (""C5 always holds"") is false because C5 is false in the next state, so it cannot hold always.
- Hence C7 = C4 ∧ C6 is false.

- Also given: ""After event1, no other events can happen"" and ""After event2, no other events can happen.""

2) Transition rules
- Once event2 has occurred, no further events can occur (the system is stuck after event2).
- Likewise, if event1 occurs, no events can occur afterwards.
- In the actual initial situation event2 has already happened, so there are no possible subsequent events or state transitions.

3) Meaning of the sub-conditions
- C1: (event2 happens) AND (event1 happens). Requires both events to have occurred.
- C2: C1 holds in the next state.
- C3: C2 eventually holds (i.e., at some future time we reach a state whose next state satisfies C1).
- C4: same as C2 (C1 holds in the next state).
- C5: implication C3 -> C4.
- C6: negation of C5 (C5 does not hold).

4) How they relate and truth values
- Because event2 has already happened and ""after event2 no other events can happen"", event1 cannot occur now or in the future. Therefore C1 is false (event1 never occurs).
- If there are no transitions after the initial state, any claim about ""the next state"" satisfying something is false (there is no next state with those properties). Thus C2 is false, and consequently C4 is false.
- C3 (""eventually C2"") is false because C2 never becomes true.
- C5 is the implication (C3 -> C4). An implication with a false antecedent is true, so C5 is true.
- C6 is the negation of C5, so C6 is false.

Conclusion: C6 is False.

(If you intended a different temporal semantics—for example allowing event1 to have happened before event2, or treating ""next"" in a model with a special sink state—state that interpretation and I can re-evaluate.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: Event2 has already occurred and prevents any further events, so event1 never occurs. Hence C1 is false, C2/C3/C4 are false, C5 (C3 -> C4) is true, and therefore its negation C6 is false."

Short answer: C7 is False (given the rules and the initial state).

Step-by-step:

1) What events and initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at time 0 (initial state) event1 happens.

2) Transition rules between events
- After event1, event2 must happen in the next state.
- After event2, event1 must happen in the next state.
Thus the system alternates: S0: event1, S1: event2, S2: event1, S3: event2, … (deterministic alternation).

3) What each sub-condition means
- C1: event1 happens and event1 happens = event1. (redundant conjunction)
- C2: C1 holds and event1 happens = event1.
- C3: C2 holds and event1 happens = event1.
- C4: C3 holds and event1 happens = event1.
- C5: event1 happens and C4 holds = event1.
- C6: event1 happens or C5 holds = event1.
So C1..C6 are all equivalent to the single proposition ""event1 happens in the current state.""
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state"" = ""event1 holds in the next state.""

4) How they relate and final evaluation
- From the timeline above, at the initial state S0 event1 is true (so C1..C6 are true at S0).
- In the next state S1, event2 holds (by the rule ""after event1, event2 must happen""), so event1 is false in S1.
- Therefore C6 is false in S1, so C7 (""C6 holds in the next state"") is false when evaluated at S0.

(If you allowed both events simultaneously in a state, the answer could change; the above uses the usual alternating interpretation implied by the ""after ..."" rules.)

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: C6 is equivalent to ""event1 holds in the current state"", so C7 (""C6 holds in the next state"") asserts event1 in the next state. From S0 (event1) the next state S1 has event2, so C7 is false."

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: at the initial (current) state s0, event1 has happened.
- Extra constraint: ""After event1, no other events can happen"" — meaning from s0 onward (including s1, s2, ...) no further events (neither event1 nor event2) occur.
- The other rule ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is a conditional that only matters if event2 ever occurs.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- Because event1 already happened at s0 and the rule forbids any further events after event1, the system is effectively terminal w.r.t. events: in every future state (s1, s2, ...) no events occur.
- Therefore event2 never occurs at any future state. The ""after event2 then event1"" rule never becomes relevant because event2 never happens.

3) What does each sub-condition mean? (informally)
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens"" — formally: F(event2). At the current state, there exists some future state where event2 occurs.
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds"" — F(C1) (there is some future state where C1 is true).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" — X(C2) (in the immediate successor state, C2 is true).
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds"" — F(C3).
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds"" — F(C4).
- C6: ""C5 always holds"" — G(C5) (C5 is true at every state).
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state"" — X(C6) (in the immediate successor state, C6 is true).

4) How do these conditions relate and what is their truth value here?
- Because no events occur after s0, event2 never occurs in any state. So C1 = F(event2) is false at every state.
- If C1 is false at every state, then C2 = F(C1) is also false (there is no future state where C1 is true).
- Then C3 = X(C2) is false at s0 (the next state’s C2 is false). Consequently C4 = F(C3) is false, and C5 = F(C4) is false.
- C6 = G(C5) asks that C5 hold at every state; but C5 is false already at the initial state, so C6 is false.
- C7 = X(C6) requires C6 to hold at the next state; C6 is false at every state, so C7 is false.

Therefore C7 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: Since event1 has already happened and no further events can occur, event2 never happens, so C1 (F(event2)) is false everywhere. That makes all subsequent F/X/G formulas false as shown, so C6 is false and thus C7 = X(C6) is false."

Short answer: C7 is False.

Step-by-step:

1) What events are involved and what are the initial conditions?
- Events: event1 and event2.
- Initial condition: event2 has happened in the initial state.
- Additional facts: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" and ""After event1, no other events can happen."" So once either event happens, no later occurrence of event1 or event2 can occur.

2) What are the transition rules between events?
- There are no transitions that can produce new occurrences of event1 or event2 after either event1 or event2 has occurred. Since event2 happened initially, the system is in a state from which neither event1 nor event2 can ever happen later.

3) What does each sub-condition mean?
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" (i.e., at every state from now on, event1 holds).
- C2: same as C1 (it is a duplicate).
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" This is an implication: event2 → (event1 always happens).
- C4: ""C1 holds or C3 holds."" (disjunction).
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" (F C4: C4 is true at some current or future state).
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" (X C5).
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" (G C6: C6 is true at every state).

4) How do these conditions relate and what follows?
- Immediately: event2 happened initially. Therefore event1 did not necessarily happen initially (and in fact cannot happen later because after event2 no events occur). So C1 and C2 (""event1 always happens"") are false: event1 does not hold now and cannot hold at all future states.
- C3 is ""if event2 then C2"". The antecedent is true (event2 happened), but the consequent C2 is false, so C3 is false.
- C4 = C1 or C3 is false ∨ false = false in the initial state, and nothing can change it later (no events can occur to make C1 or C3 true), so C4 is false at all states.
- C5 = ""eventually C4"" is false because C4 never becomes true at any current or future state.
- C6 = ""next C5"" is false (the next state does not satisfy C5, and in any case C5 never becomes true).
- C7 = ""always C6"" is false because C6 is not true now (and not true at any state), so it is not true at every state.

Therefore C7 is False.

=== Step 2: Solution ===
False

Reason: event2 occurs initially and prevents any later events, so event1 (and hence C1/C2) is false. That makes C3 false (event2 → C2 fails), so C4 is false always, so ""eventually C4"" (C5) is false, hence X C5 (C6) is false, and therefore G C6 (C7) is false."
