Step 2 — understand the context and C1–C5
- Context: initially event1 occurred; after event1, event2 must happen; after event2, event1 must happen. This forces an alternating sequence: event1, event2, event1, event2, ...
- C1: Event2 always happens. From the alternating sequence, event2 does indeed occur repeatedly (always, in the ongoing sequence).
- C2: Event2 always happens. (Same as C1.)
- C3: If C1 holds, then C2 holds. Since C1 and C2 are the same factual claim (and both true), the implication C3 is true.
- C4: Same as C3, so C4 is also true.

C7 is the statement ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds."" We must decide whether C7 is True or False given the context (initially event2; after event1 event2 must happen; after event2 event1 must happen).

Step 2 — simplify the conditions
- C1: event1 OR event1 ≡ event1.
- C2: event1 OR event1 ≡ event1.
- C3: event1 OR C2 ≡ event1 OR event1 ≡ event1.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" ≡ ""event1 holds in the next state.""
- C5: not C4 ≡ ""event1 does NOT hold in the next state.""
- C6: event1 ⇒ C5 ≡ ""If event1 holds now, then event1 does not hold in the next state.""
- C7: C1 ⇒ C6 ≡ event1 ⇒ (event1 ⇒ not C4) which is equivalent to event1 ⇒ not C4 (same as C6).

Step 3 — use the context (event alternation)
From the context: initially event2 happened; after event2, event1 must happen; after event1, event2 must happen. Thus states alternate: ... → event2 → event1 → event2 → event1 → ...
At any state where event1 holds, the next state must be event2, so event1 does NOT hold in the next state. That means C5 is true whenever event1 holds, so C6 holds in every state where event1 holds.

Step 4 — conclusion
Because whenever C1 (i.e. event1) holds, C6 holds, the implication C7 is always satisfied. Therefore:

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. The question asks whether C7 (C1 -> C6) is true given the context and the other conditions.

2. From the context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. Therefore event1 does not happen. So C1 is true. (C2 and C3 are the same statement, so they are also true.)

3. C6 is ""C2 holds or C5 holds."" Since C2 is true, C6 is true regardless of C5.

4. With antecedent C1 true and consequent C6 true, the implication C1 -> C6 (C7) is true.

Thus C7 is True."

- After event2, event1 must happen.

These rules force an alternating sequence of events starting from the initial state:
t0: event2, t1: event1, t2: event2, t3: event1, ...

Evaluate the claims:

- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" True (event1 occurs at t1).
- C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" C1 is true at t0, so there exists a (non-strict) future state where C1 holds (indeed t0 itself). Thus C2 is true.
- C3 and C4: both repeat ""Event1 eventually happens."" Both true.
- C5: ""C3 holds and C4 holds."" True (conjunction of two true statements).
- C6: ""If C2 holds, then C5 holds."" Since C2 is true and C5 is true, the implication is true.

C7 asserts that C6 holds in the next state (i.e., at t1). At t1:
- Event1 occurs immediately, so ""Event1 eventually happens"" is true at t1, hence C3, C4, and C1 are true at t1.
- Therefore C2 (eventually C1) and C5 are true at t1, so the implication C6 is true at t1.

Interpretation and reasoning:
- From the context: initially event1 happens. After event1, event2 must happen (so the next state after any event1 has event2). After event2, event1 must happen (so the next state after any event2 has event1). Starting with event1, the states alternate: event1, event2, event1, event2, ... Therefore in every state either event1 or event2 holds (indeed exactly one of them in this alternating reading).

- C2 is the same, so C2 holds as well.

Step-by-step reasoning

1. From the context: ""Initially, event2 happened."" So at the initial (and only) state event2 has occurred.
2. Also: ""After event2, no other events can happen."" Since event2 already happened initially, no further events (including event1) can ever happen.
3. Therefore event1 does not happen. So C1 (""Event1 does not happen."") is true.
4. C2 (""C1 always holds."") is true because C1 holds at the initial state and no future state exists in which it could fail.
5. C3 is the same as C1, so C3 is true.
6. C4 (""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."") is true because C2 is true and implies C3 (both are true).
7. C5 (""C4 always holds."") is true (C4 holds and there are no state changes to invalidate it).
8. C6 is the same as C1/C3, so C6 is true.
9. C7 is the implication ""If C5 holds, then C6 holds."" Since C5 is true and C6 is true, the implication C7 is true.

- We must decide whether C5 (C3 holds and C4 holds) is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — understand conditions and context
- Context:
  - Initially, event1 happened.
  - After event2, event1 must happen.
  - After event1, no other events can happen.
- Hypothesis components:
  - C1: event2 happens (stated twice — equivalent to “event2 happens”).
  - C2: event2 happens (same as C1).
  - C3: If C1 holds then C2 holds.
  - C4: If C1 holds then C2 holds (same as C3).
  - C5: C3 holds and C4 holds.

Step 3 — trace events and truth of C1, C2
- Because initially event1 already happened and “after event1 no other events can happen,” no event (including event2) can occur after that initial moment.
- There is no indication event2 happened before the initial state; the natural reading is that event2 does not occur in the described scenario.
- Therefore C1 (event2 happens) is false, and C2 is also false.

Step 4 — truth of C3 and C4
- C3 and C4 are implications of the form “if C1 then C2.”
- An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuous truth). Since C1 is false, both C3 and C4 are true.

Step 5 — truth of C5
- C5 is “C3 holds and C4 holds” → True and True → True.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- The context says initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. So the system starts in a state where event2 has occurred and there is no next state (no further events possible).

- C1 (""Event1 eventually happens""): False, because event1 did not happen initially and cannot happen later (no further events).

- C2 (""C1 always holds""): False, since C1 itself is false.

- C3 (""C2 does not hold""): True, because C2 is false.

- C4 (""C3 holds in the next state""): False, because there is no next state after the initial state (so ""in the next state"" cannot be satisfied).

- C5 (""Event1 eventually happens""): same as C1, so False.

- C6 (""C4 holds and C5 holds""): False (conjunction of two false statements).

- C7 (""C6 does not hold""): True, because C6 is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Initially event1 occurred. The rule “after event1, no other events can happen” therefore prevents any event (including event2) from occurring in any later state.
- C1, C2, C3 each assert “Event2 always happens.” That cannot hold given the above (no events can occur after the initial event1), so C1–C3 are false.
- C4 = (C2 or C3) is false. C5 = (C1 or C4) is false.
- C6 is the implication “If C5 holds, then event1 happens.” An implication with a false antecedent is vacuously true, so C6 is true in the current state.
- The truth values of C1–C5 do not change (they remain false), so the antecedent of C6 is still false in the next state; thus C6 is true in the next state.
- Therefore C7 (“C6 holds in the next state”) is True."

- Model/time: state 0 is the initial state where event1 has happened. After that (in all future states) no events occur. Event2 never occurs in any state (it cannot occur after the initial event1 and there are no prior states).

- Interpretations of the temporal operators used in the conditions:
  - ""always"" (G): true at a state iff the inner proposition holds at every current and future state.
  - ""eventually"" (F): true at a state iff the inner proposition holds at some current or future state.
  - ""next"" (X): true at a state iff the inner proposition holds at the immediate next state.

- Evaluate C1 at the initial state: ""Event1 always happens"" (G event1). Event1 happens at state 0 but does not happen in subsequent states (no further events), so G event1 is false at state 0. Hence C1 is false.

- C2 (""eventually C1""): since C1 is false at state 0 and remains false in all future states (no events change this), there is no future state where C1 becomes true, so C2 is false.

- C3 = X C2: false because C2 is false at the next state. C4 = X C3: false. C5 = F C4: false. C6 = X C5: false.

- C7 = G C6: requires C6 to hold at all states; since C6 is already false, C7 is false.

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

- C2: ""Event2 happens and C1 holds."" Event2 happens initially, and C1 holds, so C2 holds (at least in the initial state).
- C3: ""C2 holds or event1 happens."" Since C2 holds, C3 holds (in the initial state).
- C4/C5 are irrelevant for the final truth of C7 because they only affect the antecedent of C7; we do not need their exact truth value to decide C7.
- C6: same as C1, a tautology, so C6 holds.
- C7: ""If C5 holds, then C6 holds."" An implication is true whenever the consequent is true. Since C6 is true, C7 is true regardless of whether C5 holds.

Step 1 — understand the scenario
- Initially, event2 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (event1 is terminal).
- After event2, no other events can happen (event2 is terminal).
So event2 has occurred already and no further events (including event1) can occur.

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: Event1 eventually happens. False (event1 cannot happen because event2 has already happened and stops all further events).
- C2: same as C1 → False.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — false, because C2 is false and will never become true.
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" Since C1 is false, this implication is vacuously true → C4 is True.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" C4 already holds now, so C5 is True.
- C6: ""Event2 happens and C5 holds."" Event2 did happen initially and C5 holds, so C6 is True.

Step 3 — evaluate C7
- C7: ""If event2 happens, then C6 holds."" Event2 does happen (initially), and we have shown C6 is true, so the implication is true.

Step 2 — use the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1 no other events can happen (so there is no subsequent state with new events).
- Hence event2 never happens (there is no opportunity for event2 after the initial event1).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" — false (event1 did happen initially).
- C2: same as C1 — false.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" — true (implication with a false antecedent is true).
- C4: ""C3 holds and event2 happens."" — false (event2 does not happen).
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" — false (there is no next state / C4 is false).

- We are given a context about events: event2 happened initially; after event1, event2 must happen; after event2, event1 must happen.
- The hypothesis defines propositions:
  - C1: event2 does not happen.
  - C2: event2 does not happen.
  - C3: If C1 holds, then C2 holds. (C1 → C2)
  - C4: If C1 holds, then C2 holds. (same as C3)
  - C5: C3 holds and C4 holds. (C3 ∧ C4)

Examine each condition
- From the context, event2 did happen initially. Therefore C1 (""event2 does not happen"") is false. C2 is the same statement, so C2 is also false.
- C3 and C4 are implications with antecedent C1. In classical logic, an implication ""If P then Q"" is true whenever P (the antecedent) is false. Since C1 is false, both C3 and C4 are true.

Combine for C5
- C5 is C3 ∧ C4, and since both C3 and C4 are true, C5 is true.

Reasoning (step‑by‑step summary):

- C1, C2 and C5 each say ""event1 happens or event1 happens"", which is equivalent to ""event1 happens"" (call this p).
- From the context, event2 happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, so event1 does not happen (p is false).
- C3 is ""If C1 then C2"", i.e. p → p, which is a tautology and therefore true.
- C4 says ""C3 always holds"" — since C3 is a tautology, C4 is true.
- C6 is ""If event1 happens then C5 holds"", i.e. p → p, also a tautology and thus true.
- C7 is ""C4 holds or C6 holds"". Both disjuncts are true, so C7 is true."

</graphml>",1.0,"Step 1 — what’s being asked
C7 is the statement ""C6 eventually holds."" We must decide whether C7 is true under the given event dynamics.

Step 2 — interpret the conditions (with standard temporal meanings)
- The context gives an infinite alternating sequence starting with event1: s0: event1, s1: event2, s2: event1, s3: event2, ...
- Interpret ""always"" as the temporal operator G (globally), and ""in the next state"" as X (next).

Translate the C’s:
- C1 = G(event1).
- C2 = (event2 ∧ C1).
- C3 = (C2 ∧ event2) — equivalent to C2 (redundant).
- C4 = G(event1) (same as C1).
- C5 = (C3 → C4).
- C6 = X(C5).
- C7 = F(C6) (eventually C6).

Step 3 — evaluate them on the alternating sequence
- G(event1) is false: event1 does not hold in s1, s3, ... so C1 and C4 are false everywhere.
- Because C1 is false, any conjunction containing it is false, so C2 and C3 are false everywhere.
- C5 is (C3 → C4). With C3 false, the implication is vacuously true, so C5 holds in every state.
- Therefore X(C5) holds in every state that has a next state: C6 is true at s0 (since C5 holds at s1), and in fact at every state.
- Since C6 already holds (e.g. at s0), F(C6) is true. Thus C7 is true.

Evaluate each condition:

- C7 says: ""If C5 holds, then C6 holds."" We must determine whether that conditional is true given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has happened, there can be no event2 later).
- (Also: After event2, event1 must happen — irrelevant if event2 never occurs.)

Step 3 — examine the conditions
- C1, C2, C6: ""Event2 happens in the next state."" All three assert the same thing.
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" → this would mean event2 happens in the next-next state.
- C4: C1 and C3 → requires event2 in the next state and in the next-next state.
- C5: C4 and event1 happens → requires event1 and event2 in next and next-next states.

Step 4 — reason about possibility
- Because event1 happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, event2 cannot occur in any future state. Therefore C1/C2/C3/C4/C5 cannot be true in any reachable state.
- In particular, C5 is impossible (always false).

Step 5 — truth of C7
- The implication ""If C5 then C6"" is vacuously true when C5 is false. Since C5 cannot hold under the given context, the implication is always true.

3. C1 is ""if event2 happens then event1 happens"". With event2 true and event1 false, C1 is false.
4. C2 and C3 are implications whose antecedent is C1. Since C1 is false, C2 and C3 are both true (implications with false antecedent are true).

- Initially, event1 happened.

- After event2, no other events can happen (also terminal).

Evaluate the conditions step by step
1. C1: ""Event2 always happens."" False — event2 does not occur after the initial event1 (there is only the terminal state after event1), so event2 does not always happen.

2. C2: ""C1 holds or event1 happens."" True at the initial state because event1 does happen initially (even though C1 is false).

3. C3: ""C2 holds in the next state."" False — there is no next state after the terminal state produced by event1, so a next-state claim is not satisfied.

4. C4: ""C3 holds and event1 happens."" False (C3 is false).

5. C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" False (C4 is false, and there is no next state).

6. C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" False — C5 never holds, so it is not true that C5 holds at any future point.

7. C7: ""C6 always holds."" False — since C6 is false (already false at the initial state), it cannot be true that C6 holds in all states.

Step-by-step reasoning

1. Set up the timeline and atomic facts
- Time 0 (initial): event2 happened.  
- After event2 (i.e. at times ≥ 1), no events happen. (So for t ≥ 1, both event1 and event2 are false.)
- event1, if it ever occurred, would also be terminal, but it does not occur here.

2. Interpret the conditions (standard temporal reading)
- C1: P1 ∨ P2, where P1 = “event1 happens” (at the current state), P2 = “event2 happens” (at the current state).
- C2: P1 → C1.
- C3: always C2 (C2 holds at every state).
- C4: next C3 (C3 holds in the immediate successor state).
- C5: eventually C4 (at some state from now on, C4 holds).
- C6: always C5 (C5 holds at every state).
- C7: next C6 (C6 holds in the immediate successor state).

3. Evaluate C2
- C2 is P1 → (P1 ∨ P2). This is a propositional tautology: whenever P1 is true, P1 ∨ P2 is automatically true. Thus C2 is true at every state.

4. Propagate through the temporal operators
- Since C2 is true at every state, C3 (“always C2”) is true.
- If C3 is true at every state, then C3 is true in the next state, so C4 is true.
- C4 is true (already at time 0 and at all states), so “eventually C4” (C5) is true at every state.
- Therefore C6 (“always C5”) is true.
- Finally, C6 being true at every state means C6 holds in the next state, so C7 is true.

Therefore C7 is True."

Interpretation of context:
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has happened, event2 can never occur afterwards).
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 never occurs after event1, and event1 already happened initially.

Step-by-step evaluation of conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" Given event1 happened initially and no events can happen after that, event2 cannot happen at any time. So C1 is True.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 is True, C2 is False.
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" The antecedent (event2 happens) is false, so the implication is vacuously True. Thus C3 is True.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 already holds, so C4 is True.
- C5: ""If event2 happens, then C4 holds."" Antecedent false, so implication is vacuously True. C5 is True.
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" C5 is True, so C6 is False.

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context: event1 occurs initially, and after event1 no other events can happen. That makes any occurrence of event2 impossible (it cannot occur before the initial event1, and it cannot occur after it).

2. Therefore C1 (""Event2 eventually happens"") and C2 (same) are both false. Hence C3 (C1 and C2) is false.

3. C4 (""If C3 holds, then event2 happens"") is an implication with a false antecedent, so C4 is true (vacuously). C5 (""If event2 happens, then C4 holds"") is also vacuously true because event2 never happens.

4. C6 asserts ""C5 holds in the next state."" But there is no next state after the initial state (no events can happen after event1), so the next-state formula does not hold. Hence C6 is false.

5. C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") therefore cannot be satisfied (C6 is false in every state), so C7 is false."

Reasoning step-by-step:

- System facts: event2 occurs initially. After event2 (and after event1) no other events can happen — so there is no next state after the initial state.

- C1 (event2 always happens): false — event2 only happens initially, not in all (future) states.

- C2 (C1 holds in the next state) and C5 (same statement): false — there is no next state, so ""holds in the next state"" is false.

- C3 (C2 always holds): false — C2 is false at the initial state, so it is not true always.

- C4 (if C3 then event2): true — the implication is vacuously true because C3 is false.

- C6 (C4 or C5): true — C4 is true, so the disjunction is true.

- We must decide whether C6 (""C5 eventually holds"") is true or false given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — use the context to fix which events occur
- Initially event1 happened.
- The context also says: after event1, event2 must happen. Since event1 did happen initially, event2 will happen (at some point after that).
- Also: after event2, no other events can happen — irrelevant for truth of these conditionals except to confirm event2 does indeed occur and then nothing further happens.

So event2 does happen. Therefore the proposition C1 (""Event2 does not happen"") is false.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions one by one
- C1 is false.
- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" An implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously). So C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Since C2 is true (and C1 is never true at any time, because event2 does happen), C2 holds at all times, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then event2 happens."" This is the same as C2, so C4 is true.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" C3 is true and C4 is true, so C5 is true (in fact the implication is true).

- C2: C1 holds and event2 happens. True (C1 holds and event2 does occur after the initial event1).

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):
- Initially event2 has already happened.
- After event2 no other events can happen, so there are no further changes; event2 is already the case and nothing can invalidate it.
- Therefore any claim that “event2 happens” (or “event2 always happens” in the sense that it does occur in this execution) is true. So C1, C2, and C4 are true.
- C3 = C1 or C2 is true. C5 = C4 or event2 happens is true. Hence C6 = C3 or C5 is true now.

- C1, C2, C3 are the same statement: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens.""
- C4: If C2 holds, then C3 holds. Since C2 and C3 are identical, C4 is a tautology (P → P).
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" A tautology holds immediately, so C4 does indeed hold (hence eventually holds).
- C6: ""C5 does not hold."" This contradicts the previous line, so C6 is false.
- C7: ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds."" This will be true only if either C1 is false or C6 is true.

Step 2 — use the background (context) about events
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → event1 happens at some later time.
- After event1, event2 must happen → event2 happens again.
So both event1 and event2 do happen; therefore C1 is true.

- C1 is true and C6 is false, so the implication ""If C1 then C6"" is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. So event2 can never occur in any next state.
- C1 (""Event2 happens in the next state"") is therefore false.
- C2 (""C1 holds in the next state"") is false (because C1 is false in the next state).
- C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false (C2 is not true).
- C4 (""C3 always holds"") is false.
- C5 (""C4 always holds"") is false.
- C6 (""Event2 happens in the next state"") is false (same as C1).
- C7 is the implication ""If C5 holds, then C6 holds."" Since C5 is false, the implication is vacuously true.

Interpretation and setup
- Timeline: state 0 is the initial state. Given the constraints, events alternate each step:
  - state 0: event2 (given)
  - state 1: event1 (must follow event2)
  - state 2: event2 (must follow event1)
  - state 3: event1, etc.
- For any state n:
  - event2(n) is true iff n is even.
  - event2(n+1) is true iff n+1 is even (i.e. n odd).
  - event2(n+2) is true iff n+2 is even (i.e. n even).

Evaluate the Ci formulas at an arbitrary state n
- C1(n): event2 at n+1.
- C2(n): C1 at n+1 ⇔ event2 at n+2.
- C3(n): C2(n) ∧ event2(n).
- C4(n): C3(n) ∨ event2(n).
- C5(n): event2 at n+1 (same as C1).
- C6(n): C4(n) → C5(n).
- C7: ∃k ≥ 0 such that C6(k) holds.

Compute for even n (n = 2m)
- event2(n) = true, event2(n+1) = false, event2(n+2) = true.
- C1 = false, C2 = true, C3 = true (true ∧ true), C4 = true, C5 = false.
- C6 = C4 → C5 = true → false = false.

Compute for odd n (n = 2m+1)
- event2(n) = false, event2(n+1) = true, event2(n+2) = false.
- C1 = true, C2 = false, C3 = false, C4 = false, C5 = true.
- C6 = C4 → C5 = false → true = true.

Conclusion
- C6 holds at every odd state (e.g., state 1).
- Therefore C6 holds at some future state from the initial state (state 1), so ""C6 eventually holds"" is true.

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Context gives a single timeline: initially event2 happened. After any event2, event1 must happen. After event1 no further events can happen. So the possible sequence is: event2 (initial) → event1 → stop.

- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" True — because event2 already happened initially, so whenever event1 occurs it is after that event2.

- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" False (negation of the true C1).

- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" False — C2 is false and does not become true.

- C4: ""C3 does not hold."" True (negation of false C3).

- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" False (negation of true C4).

- C6: same as C1, so True.

- C7: ""C5 holds and C6 holds."" C5 is false and C6 is true, so the conjunction is False.

Therefore C7 is False."

- Let E1 = ""event1 happens (at some point)"" and E2 = ""event2 happens (at some point)"".
- Context gives:
  - Initially E1 holds.
  - After E2, E1 must happen (so E2 -> E1).
  - After E1, E2 must happen (so E1 -> E2, i.e. E1 implies eventual E2).

Step 2 — understand the Ci
- C1 = E2 ∧ E2, i.e. simply E2 (event2 happens).
- C2 = (C1 -> E1) which is E2 -> E1.
- C3 = same as C2 (E2 -> E1).
- C4 = (C3 -> E2) which is (E2 -> E1) -> E2.
- C5 = eventually C4, i.e. eventually((E2 -> E1) -> E2).
- C6 = (C2 -> C5) i.e. (E2 -> E1) -> eventually((E2 -> E1) -> E2).

Step 3 — use the context to evaluate
- From context we have E1 initially and E1 -> eventual E2, so event2 does happen (eventually E2). Therefore E2 is true (in the model/timeline).
- From context we also have E2 -> E1, so C2 (E2 -> E1) holds.
- Since E2 -> E1 holds globally, (E2 -> E1) -> E2 is equivalent to E2 at all times where E2->E1 is true. Thus C4 is equivalent to E2, and C5 (""eventually C4"") is equivalent to ""eventually E2"", which we already established is true.

Step 4 — conclude about C6
- C2 is true and C5 is true, so the implication C2 -> C5 is true. Hence C6 is True.

Step-by-step reasoning (standard linear-time / state-based reading of the formulas):

1. C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology (p → p), so C1 is true at every state.

2. C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is true at every state, C2 is true.

3. C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" If C2 holds always, it certainly holds at some future point, so C3 is true.

4. C4: ""C3 holds and event2 happens."" C3 holds (indeed everywhere). Event2 must occur after the initial event1 by the context, so there is at least one state where event2 happens. Thus C4 is true at the state(s) where event2 occurs (C4 need not hold at states where event2 is not happening).

5. C5: ""C4 always holds."" Because C4 is only true at the time(s) when event2 is actually happening, it is not true at all states; therefore C5 is false.

6. C6: ""C5 does not hold."" Since C5 is false, C6 is true (and in fact true at all states).

7. C7: ""C6 eventually holds."" Because C6 already holds (immediately), C7 is true.

Therefore C7 is True."

- We must decide whether C7 (""C6 always holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — facts from the context
- Initially, event1 happened. (So event1 does happen.)
- After event1, no other events can happen. (Once event1 has happened, no further events can occur.)
- After event2, no other events can happen. (If event2 were to happen, it would also prevent further events.)

Step 3 — reason about event2
- Because event1 has already happened and after event1 no other events can happen, event2 cannot occur at any time. So ""Event2 does not happen"" is true.

Step 4 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: Event2 does not happen — True.
- C2: Event1 happens or C1 holds — True (event1 happens).
- C3: Event2 does not happen — True (same as C1).
- C4: Event2 does not happen — True (same).
- C5: C3 holds or C4 holds — True.
- C6: C2 holds or C5 holds — True.

Step 5 — C7 (""C6 always holds"")
- C6 is a proposition that, given the context, is true based on the fixed facts above. Its truth does not depend on a later change (the events are fixed by the context), so C6 holds at all times considered. Therefore C7 is True.

- After event2, event1 must happen.

Step 3 — Evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event1 does not happen."" This is false, because event1 happened initially.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" This is the negation of C1. Since C1 is false, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" C2 is already true, so C3 is true.
- C4: ""C1 does not hold."" Same as C2, so C4 is true.

- We evaluate whether C7 (C1 or C6) holds given the context. Assume we evaluate these conditions in the initial state (where ""Initially, event1 happened"").

Step 2 — model the timeline from the context
- State0 (initial): event1 happened.
- State1 (next): by the rules, event2 must happen.
- State2: then event1 must happen, and so on (alternating event1, event2...).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions at State0
- C1: ""event2 happens and event2 happens"" — false at State0 (event2 does not happen at State0).
- C2: same as C1 — false at State0.
- C3: C2 and event1 — requires C2 true and event1 at State0. C2 is false, so C3 is false at State0.
- C4: ""If C3 holds, then event2 happens."" At State0, C3 is false, so the implication is vacuously true. Thus C4 is true at State0.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state."" We must check C4 at State1. At State1, event2 holds, C2 is true there (event2), but C3 at State1 is false (because event1 does not hold at State1), so C4 is vacuously true at State1. Therefore C5 is true at State0.
- C6: ""C5 holds or event1 happens."" At State0, C5 is true (and event1 also happens), so C6 is true.
- C7: ""C1 holds or C6 holds."" C1 is false but C6 is true, so C7 is true at State0.

- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" An implication with a false antecedent (C2 is false) is vacuously true, so C3 is True.
- C4: ""If C1 holds, then C3 holds."" Antecedent C1 is false, so C4 is vacuously true.
- C5: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens."" Same as C3, vacuously true, so C5 is True.

Step 4 — evaluate C6:
C6 is ""C4 holds or C5 holds."" Both C4 and C5 are True, so their disjunction C6 is True.

- ""After event2, no other events can happen"" means in any state following a state where event2 occurred, no events (including event2) occur. Thus the next state after the initial one does not have event2 true.
- C2 asserts that C1 holds in the next state. Since the next state has no event2, C1 is false there, so C2 is false in the initial state.
- C3 and C4 assert C2 holds in the next state (i.e., two steps ahead from the initial state). Because C2 is already false in the next state, C3 and C4 are both false.

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

1. Initially event1 happened, so ""event1 eventually happens"" (C1 and C2) is true now.

2. C3 = ""C2 eventually holds"". Since C2 already holds now, C3 is true. Similarly C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is true.

3. C5 requires ""C4 holds in the next state"". But the context says that after event1 no other events can happen, i.e. the run stops immediately after the initial state (there is no meaningful next state), or at best any successor state cannot reestablish the occurrences that made C2 true. In either interpretation, C4 does not necessarily hold in the immediate successor: if there is no successor then X(C4) is false; if there is a successor then C2 (which depended on event1 occurring at the initial state) will typically be false there so C3 and C4 will not hold there. Therefore C5 is false.

4. C6 = C1 and C5 is false (true ∧ false = false). Finally C7 = ""C6 holds in the next state"" is false (either because there is no next state or because C6 is false in any successor).

Thus C7 is False."

Reasoning step-by-step:

- C1 is just ""event2 happens"" (redundant disjunction).
- C2 is (event1 -> event2). Because event1 does not occur in the system, this implication is true (vacuously) in any state where event1 does not hold.
- C3 is ""C2 always holds."" In the given system the only reachable state is the initial one (event2 happened) and C2 holds there, so C3 is true in the only state and thus true globally.
- C4 is ""C3 holds in the next state"" (X C3). But after event2 no other events can happen, so there is no next state. The next-step operator requires a successor state; with no successor X C3 is false.
- Similarly C5 = X C4 and C6 = X C5 are false (they require further successors that do not exist).
- C7 is ""eventually C6"" (F C6). Because C6 is false now and there are no future states in which it could become true, C7 is false.

Therefore C7 is False."

C5 is the statement ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" We must determine whether C5 is True or False given the context and the definitions of C1–C4.

Step 2 — interpret the context and implications:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → therefore event1 does happen (following the initial event2).
- After event1, event2 must happen → therefore event2 happens as well (possibly repeatedly). So both event1 and event2 occur.

Step 3 — evaluate C1–C4:
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event2 happens."" Given the context, C1 is True.
- C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds."" This simplifies to just ""Event1 happens"" (since C1 implies event1), and we already established event1 happens, so C2 is True.
- C3: ""C2 does not hold."" Since C2 is True, C3 is False.
- C4: ""C2 does not hold."" Same as C3, so C4 is False.

Step 4 — evaluate C5:
C5 is the implication (C3 → C4). That is (False → False). In classical logic an implication with a false antecedent is True (it is vacuously true). Even if you note C3 and C4 are identical, ""if X then X"" is also true. Therefore C5 is True.

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

- Interpret ""always"" as the global operator (G) and ""in the next state"" as X.
- C1 and C2 are the tautology (event2 -> event2), so they hold in every state.
- C3 is G(C2). Since C2 is a tautology, C3 is true in every state.
- C4 is (C3 or event2). Because C3 is true everywhere, C4 is true in every state.
- C5 is X(C4). Since C4 is true in every state, X(C4) is true in every state.
- C6 is (C1 and C5). Both conjuncts hold in every state, so C6 holds in every state.
- C7 is G(C6). Because C6 holds in every state, G(C6) is true.

- We must decide whether C5 (""If C3 holds, then C4 holds"") is True or False given the context.

Step 2 — understand the context and each condition
- Context: event1 happened initially. After event1, event2 must happen. After event2, no other events can happen. Therefore event2 does happen (it is required after event1).
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" — this contradicts the context, so C1 is false.
- C2: ""Event2 does not happen."" — same as C1, so C2 is false.
- C3: ""C1 holds and C2 holds."" — false AND false gives false, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""C1 holds and C2 holds."" — identical to C3, so C4 is also false.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" — an implication.

Step 3 — reason about the implication
- Since C3 is false in the given context, the implication ""If C3 then C4"" has a false antecedent. In classical logic, an implication with a false antecedent is true (vacuously true).
- Also, C3 and C4 are identical statements, so logically whenever C3 holds C4 would hold; the implication is therefore true in either interpretation.

Step 3 — evaluate the Cs:

Step 3 — reason through it:
Always(C2 ∧ event1) implies Always C2 (and Always event1). Always C2 means C2 holds as a global property; but C2 is itself Always C1. So Always C2 is equivalent to Always C1 (nesting of Always is idempotent). Thus from C4 we get Always C1, which is exactly C5.

- Timeline (from the context): s0 (initial) where event2 happens; then s1 where event1 must happen; after event1 no further events occur (s2, s3, ... have no events).
- Interpret temporal operators in standard linear-time way: ""always"" = G (holds at all current and future states), ""next"" = X (holds at the immediate next state), and ""eventually"" = F (holds at some state now or in the future).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions on this path
- C1 = G(event2). Is event2 true at every state? No: event2 is true at s0 only, not at s1 or later. So C1 is false at s0.
- C2 = X C1. At s0 this requires C1 to hold at s1. But C1 is false at s1 (event2 does not hold there), so C2 is false at s0.
- C3 = G(C2). Since C2 is already false at s0 (and in fact at all states), C3 is false at s0.
- C4 = X C3. This asks that C3 hold at s1; but C3 is false, so C4 is false at s0.
- C5 = F C4. Since C4 is false at every state on the path, ""eventually C4"" is false at s0. So C5 is false.
- C6 = ""C5 does not hold"" = ¬C5. Since C5 is false, C6 is true at s0.
- C7 = F C6. C6 is true already at s0, so ""eventually C6"" is true (holds now).

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- Context: initially event1 is true (at the initial state). After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 holds in the next state). After event2, no other events can happen (not needed for the final conclusion).

- Evaluate the Ci propositions in the initial state:
  - C1: ""Event1 does not happen"" → False (event1 holds initially).
  - C2: ""Event1 happens or C1 holds"" → event1 ∨ ¬event1, which is True (indeed event1 holds).
  - C3: ""If C2 holds, then event2 happens"" → since C2 is True, this amounts to asserting event2 in the current state. But event2 occurs in the next state (per the context), so C3 is False in the initial state.
  - C4: ""C3 does not hold"" → True (negation of C3).
  - C5: ""C4 does not hold"" → False (negation of C4).
  - C6: ""C5 holds in the next state"" → False (C5 is false now, and nothing forces it to be true next).
  - C7: ""C6 holds or event1 happens"" → C6 ∨ event1. event1 is True in the initial state, so C7 is True.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition at t0 (unless otherwise noted):
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event2 happens."" At t0 event2 is true, so C1 is true at t0.

Reasoning:
- Initially event1 happened, and after event1 no other events can happen. So the run ends immediately after the initial state; there is no future state in which any event (including event2) can occur.
- C1 (""event2 eventually happens"") is therefore false.
- C2 (""C1 does not hold"") is true.
- C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true as well, because there are no future states in which C1 could become true; C2 holds in every reachable state (vacuously/actually).
- C4 is the same as C2, so true. Hence C5 (C3 or C4) is true.
- C6 asserts that C5 holds in the next state. But there is no next state (no events can happen after the initial event1), so ""in the next state"" is not satisfied. Under the standard interpretation where Xϕ is false in a terminal state with no successor, C6 is false."

Step 1 — interpret the given facts
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur again).

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1: Event1 does not happen. (This contradicts the fact that event1 happened initially.)
- C2: If event2 happens, then C1 (i.e., event2 → (event1 does not happen)).
- C3: If event2 happens, then C1 (same as C2).
- C4: C3 eventually holds.
- C5: C2 holds or C4 holds.
- C6: Event1 happens and C5 holds.

Step 3 — trace the sequence and consequences
- From the context, event1 does happen (initially and repeatedly), so C1 is false.
- Event2 does happen (because it must follow event1). If C2 (or C3) were true, then event2 would imply C1, forcing C1 true — contradiction with known event1 occurrences. Therefore C2 and C3 cannot be true in this system.
- Because C3 never becomes true (it is false whenever event2 occurs, and event2 must occur), C4 (""C3 eventually holds"") is also false.
- Hence both disjuncts of C5 are false, so C5 is false.
- C6 requires event1 happens (true) AND C5 holds (false). The conjunction is false.

Understand the context:
- Initially event2 happened (so event2 has already happened at time 0).
- After event2, no other events can happen (so no event1 can ever occur at any later time).
- The rule ""After event1, event2 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event1 never occurs.

Evaluate the conditions on this trace:
- C1 (event1 eventually happens): False — event1 cannot occur after the initial event2, and there is no time before the initial state.
- C2 is the same as C1: False.
- C3 (C2 holds and event2 happens): requires C2 true, so False.
- C4 (C3 eventually holds): False.
- C5 (event1 happens and C4 holds): False.
- C6 (If C1 holds, then C5 holds): an implication with a false antecedent is true, so C6 is True on this trace.
- C6 remains true at every timepoint because at every timepoint C1 is false (event1 will never occur), so the implication stays vacuously true.

Therefore C7 (""C6 always holds"") is True.

True"

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The question asks whether C7 (""C6 holds in the next state"") is true given the context and the Ci definitions.
- From the context, event2 happened initially. Therefore the proposition ""Event2 does not happen"" (C1, C2, C3) is false at the initial state.
- C4 is ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" Since C2 and C3 are the same proposition, C4 is the implication X → X, which is true in any state.
- C5 = C1 or C4. C1 is false but C4 is true, so C5 is true (at the initial state and, in fact, at any state because C4 is always true).
- C6 = ""C5 always holds."" Because C5 is true at every state (C4 is a tautological implication), C6 is true.
- C7 = ""C6 holds in the next state."" However, the context says that after event2 no other events can happen, so there is no successor (no next) state. Under the usual interpretation of a ""next"" operator (requires a successor state), X φ is false when there is no next state. Therefore C7 is false."

1) From the context: event1 happens initially, and after event1 no other events can happen. Therefore the system reaches a state in which event1 has occurred and nothing can change later. In other words, once the run starts it is forever the case that no new events occur after that initial event1.

2) C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Given the system stays in the state reached immediately after the initial event1 and nothing else can occur, event1 holds at every future moment. Thus C1 is true.

3) C2 and C3: Each says ""C1 eventually holds."" Since C1 already holds from the initial state, it certainly holds eventually (indeed immediately). So C2 and C3 are true.

4) C4: ""C2 holds and C3 holds."" Both are true, so C4 is true.

5) C5: ""Event1 always happens."" This is the same as C1, already established true.

6) C6: ""C4 holds and C5 holds."" Both C4 and C5 are true, so C6 is true.

</graphml>",1.0,"Step 1 — what is being asked
You ask whether C6 (""C5 eventually holds"") is true or false given the context and the chain of conditions C1–C5.

Step 2 — understand the context
- Initially, event2 has happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so event1 cannot occur at or after the initial moment).
- Also: after event1, event2 must happen (this won’t ever be triggered because event1 cannot happen).

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautological implication (A → A). It is true at every state (vacuously true when event1 does not happen, and trivially true if it does).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" Since C1 is true at every state, C2 is true.
- C3: ""C1 always holds."" (same as C2) — also true.
- C4: ""C3 holds or event1 happens."" C3 holds, so C4 is true regardless of whether event1 ever happens.
- C5: ""C2 holds and C4 holds."" Both parts are true, so C5 holds (in fact it holds at all times).
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" Because C5 already holds (indeed always), it certainly holds at some time (now), so ""eventually C5"" is true.

Step 4 — account for the context constraints
The fact that event2 happened initially and no further events can happen does not falsify any of the above statements — the implication in C1 is tautological and the ""always"" and ""eventually"" claims about the C-conditions remain true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the context the states alternate: state0 has event1, state1 has event2, state2 has event1, etc.
- Evaluate at the initial state (state0):
  - C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state"" — false (state1 has event2).
  - C2: same as C1 — false.
  - C3: ""Event2 happens or C2 holds"" — both disjuncts false at state0, so C3 is false.
  - C4: ""Event1 happens and C3 holds"" — event1 is true at state0 but C3 is false, so C4 is false.
  - C5: ""C4 always holds"" — false (C4 is already false at state0, and also fails at state1).
  - C6: ""C5 holds in the next state"" — false.

Step-by-step reasoning

1. Interpret the context as a sequence of states where ""after X, Y must happen"" means: whenever X holds in a state, Y holds in the next state. With the given rules and the initial fact:
   - s0: event1 holds.
   - From ""after event1, event2 must happen"" we get s1: event2 holds (and event1 does not hold there).
   - From ""after event2, event1 must happen"" we get s2: event1 holds.
   - So event1 holds in s0, s2, s4,... and does not hold in s1, s3,...

2. Simplify the Ci:
   - C1: ""event1 or event1"" ≡ event1.
   - C2: same as C1 ≡ event1.
   - C3: ""C2 does not hold"" ≡ not event1.
   - C4: ""C3 does not hold"" ≡ not(not event1) ≡ event1.
   - C5: ""If C1 holds, then C4 holds"" ≡ (event1 → event1), which is a tautology, so C5 is true in every state.
   - C6: ""C5 holds in the next state"" — since C5 is true in every state, C6 is true in every state.
   - C7: ""C6 holds in the next state"" — since C6 is true in every state, C7 is true in every state.

3. Therefore C7 is true (in particular at the initial state)."

</graphml>",0.0,"Step 1 — what is being asked
- C6 is the implication ""If C2 holds, then C5 holds."" We must decide whether that implication is true given the context and the other conditions.

Step 2 — interpret the context and each condition
- Context:
  1. Initially, event1 happened (so at the initial state C1 = ""event2 or event1"" is true).
  2. After event2, event1 must happen (but event2 never actually gets to occur here because of the next point).
  3. After event1, no other events can happen (so once event1 has occurred, there are no further events in any future state).
- Conditions:
  - C1: ""event2 happens or event1 happens.""
  - C2: ""C1 eventually holds."" (The eventuality operator allows the current state, so this is true if C1 holds now or later.)
  - C3: same as C2 (redundant).
  - C4: ""C3 holds in the next state.""
  - C5: ""C4 always holds.""
  - C6: ""If C2 holds, then C5 holds.""

Step 3 — reason through the sequence
- Because event1 happened initially, C1 is true at the initial state. Hence C2 (eventually C1) is true (it already holds now).
- After that initial state no other events can happen, so in the next state no event2 or event1 will occur ever again. Therefore, in the next state C1 will not become true in the future; so in the next state C3 (""C1 eventually holds"") is false.
- Thus C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is false. Since C4 is not true in general, C5 (""C4 always holds"") is false.
- We have: C2 is true but C5 is false, so the implication C6 (C2 → C5) is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. C1 and C4 are implications of the form ""event1 -> event1"", so they are tautologically true in any state.

2. C2 is ""C1 holds and event1 happens"". C1 holds but event1 does not happen: the context says initially event2 happened and after event2 no other events can happen, so event1 never occurs. Therefore C2 is false.

3. C3 is ""if event2 happens, then C2 holds"". Event2 did happen, but C2 is false, so C3 is false.

4. C5 is ""if C3 holds, then C4 holds"". Since C4 is always true, the implication C5 is true regardless of C3 (an implication with a true consequent is true, and with a false antecedent is also true). Thus C5 holds.

5. C6 states ""C5 holds in the next state."" Even if no events occur after the initial one, C5 (a tautically true implication) still holds in the next state, so C6 is true.

6. Finally, C7 is ""event1 happens or C6 holds"". Event1 does not happen, but C6 does hold, so the disjunction is true.

C5 is the formula ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" We must determine whether that implication is true in the given system.

Step 2 — examine the conditions
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a logical tautology (an implication with identical antecedent and consequent), so C1 is true in every state.
- C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" Since C1 is true in every state, it is certainly true in the next state as well. So C2 holds in every state.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Because C2 holds at every state, C3 is true.
- C4: ""C2 always holds."" C4 is the same as C3, so C4 is also true.
- C5: ""If C3 holds, then C4 holds."" This is an implication between two true statements, so it is true.

Step 3 — trace/consistency check
The context forces an infinite alternating sequence (starting with event2), but that does not affect the above: C1 is true everywhere, so C2 is true at every next state, hence C3 and C4 are true globally. Therefore C5 is true.

- C1 / C2 (""Event2 always happens""): cannot hold — event2 cannot occur because no events can occur after the initial event1. So C1 and C2 are false.
- C3 (""C2 does not hold""): true (since C2 is false).
- C4 (""C3 eventually holds""): true (C3 already holds in the initial state).
- C5 (""If C1 holds, then C4 holds""): true (implication with a false antecedent is true).
- C6 (""C5 holds in the next state""): false — there is no next state (after event1 no other events can happen), so a ""next"" requirement fails.
- C7 (""C6 always holds""): false, because C6 is already false in the initial (and only) state.

Therefore C7 is False."

- The context also says ""After event2, event1 must happen,"" which matches C1 (""If event2 happens, then event1 happens""). Given the context, C1 is true (both by the explicit rule and vacuously since event2 never occurs).

Step 3 — evaluate the chain of conditions

Reasoning (step‑by‑step, using temporal reading: ""happens"" = occurs at some future time; ""eventually"" = at some future time; ""always"" = at all times):

- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event1 happens."" This is a tautology and holds (in particular it holds initially, since event1 did happen).
- Given C1 holds and the context rule ""after event1, event2 must happen"", at the initial moment event2 will (eventually) happen; so C2 and C3 (both: if C1 then event2 happens) are satisfied initially. Hence C4 = C2 or C3 holds initially.
- C5 = ""C4 eventually holds."" Since C4 already holds initially, C5 holds at the initial moment.
- C6 = ""C5 always holds."" We must check all times. After event2 occurs, the context says no further events can happen. At those later times there is no future occurrence of event2. C2 and C3 (which require a future event2 if C1 holds) therefore become false at times after event2, so C4 is false thereafter. Thus at those times C5 (""C4 eventually holds"") is false. Therefore C5 is not true at all times, so C6 is false."

Examine the context and conditions:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (and likewise after event1 nothing else can happen).
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" Because event2 happens initially and after event2 no other events can happen, event1 cannot happen as well. So C1 is false.
- C2 depends on C1 (it is ""Event1 happens and C1 holds""), so C2 is false.

- Initially event2 holds.
- ""After event1, event2 must happen"" and ""After event2, event1 must happen"" means the two events alternate in successive states: event2, event1, event2, event1, ...
- Interpret ""always"" as globally (holds at every state), ""eventually"" as ""at some state in the future (including the current one)”, and ""in the next state"" as the immediate successor.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 always happens."" False, because event2 is false in the states where event1 holds.
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" False, since C1 is already false at the initial state (so it cannot hold globally).
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" False for the same reason.
- C4: ""Event2 happens or C3 holds."" At event2 states this is true (because event2 is true); at event1 states C3 is false and event2 is false, so C4 is false at those states. So C4 holds exactly at the event2 states.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" From any state (whether event2 or event1) there is some future state with event2, hence some future state with C4. So C5 is true at every state.

</graphml>",1.0,"Step 1 — What is being asked
We must decide whether C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true given the context and the definitions C1–C6.

Step 2 — Interpret the context and semantics
- Initial state (state 0): event2 happened.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" and ""After event1, event2 must happen"" enforce an alternation: state0: event2, state1: event1, state2: event2, state3: event1, ….
- Read C1 as a property evaluated at a state: C1(s) = ""event2 happens in the next state (s+1)"". ""Always"" and ""eventually"" are the usual temporal operators over all future states.

Step 3 — Evaluate the conditions
- C1 at a state s is true iff s+1 has event2. Under the alternating sequence, C1 holds at exactly those s whose successor is an event2 state (i.e., at odd s).
- C2(s) = ""C1 always holds from s"" — that would require every future state's successor to be event2 (i.e., all future states s+1, s+2, … have event2). That is false in the alternating sequence. So C2 is false at every state.
- C3(s) = ""C2 does not hold"" — since C2 is false everywhere, C3 is true at every state.
- C4 is the same as C1; it is not needed because C3 already holds everywhere.
- C5(s) = ""C3 holds or C4 holds"" — since C3 is true at every state, C5 is true at every state.
- C6(s) = ""eventually C5 holds"" — because C5 already holds at s, ""eventually C5"" is true at every state (it holds immediately).
- C7(s) = ""C6 always holds"" — C6 is true at every state, so C7 is true.

C7 is True."

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Timeline: s0 is the initial state where event1 happened. After that (s1 and onward) no events occur (so event1 is false at s1 and later). Event2 never occurs.

- C1 (Event1 always happens): false, because event1 holds at s0 but not at s1 (so it is not true at all times).

- C2 (C1 holds in the next state): false, because C1 is false at s1.

- C3 (C2 holds and event1 happens): false at s0 (C2 false, even though event1 is true).

- C4 (C3 holds in the next state): false at s1 (C3 is false at s1).

- C5 (C4 always holds): false, since C4 is not true at all states.

- C6 (Event1 always happens): same as C1, false.

- C7 (C5 holds or C6 holds): false OR false = false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- The initial state has event2 occur, and after event2 no further events can occur. So event2 happens only at the initial moment and does not hold at all later times.
- C1 and C2 (""event2 always happens"") are false because event2 is not true at all future states.
- C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is false because C2 never becomes true at any future point.
- C4 (""C3 holds in the next state"") is false because C3 is false.
- C5 (C1 and C4) is false since both conjuncts are false.
- C6 (""C5 eventually holds"") is false because C5 never holds.

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. Context implies event2 happened initially (so event2 is true at least initially), and by the rules event2 and event1 alternate indefinitely (after any event2 an event1 must happen, and after any event1 an event2 must happen). Thus event2 does happen.

2. Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: ""Event2 does not happen."" This is false (event2 does happen).
- C2: same as C1, so false.
- C3: ""C1 holds and C2 holds."" False and False gives C3 = false.
- C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 never holds, so C4 = false.
- C5: ""C4 holds and event2 happens."" C4 is false, so C5 = false.

- After event2, event1 must happen (irrelevant if event2 never occurs).

3) Use the context to evaluate possibility of C1:
- Because event1 happened initially and after event1 no other events can happen, event2 can never occur in any state.
- Hence C1 (event2 ∧ event1) is false in every state (there is never a state where event2 holds).
- Therefore X C1 is false in every state as well.

- Initially event2 happened (so at the initial state, event2 holds).
- After event2, no other events can happen (the system reaches a quiescent state with no further occurrences).

Step 2 — evaluate the conditions at the initial state
- C1: ""Event2 eventually happens."" True at the initial state because event2 already happened there.
- C2: same as C1, so True.
- C3: ""Event1 happens or C2 holds."" C2 holds, so C3 is True.
- C4: C1 and C3, so True ∧ True = True.

Step 3 — check the ""always"" and next-state conditions
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" This requires C4 to hold at the initial state and at all future states. But after event2 no further events happen, so at the next state event2 does not (and will not) occur again. From that next state, ""event2 eventually happens"" is false, so C1 (and thus C3 and C4) is false there. Hence C4 is not true at all states, so C5 is False at the initial state.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" We just saw C5 is false at the next state, so C6 is False at the initial state.
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state."" That asks whether C6 is true at the next state. At the next state, the same reasoning gives C5 false at its next state, so C6 is false at the next state. Therefore C7 is False at the initial state.

The context gives no indication that event1 happened; moreover, because ""After event2, no other events can happen"" and event2 happened initially, event1 cannot occur after event2.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the context: S0 (initial) has event2. Rules force alternation: after event2 → event1 at S1, after event1 → event2 at S2, etc. So sequence: S0: event2, S1: event1, S2: event2, ...
- C1 = ""event1 and event1"" — this just means event1 holds at a state. At S0 C1 is false, at S1 C1 is true.
- C2 = ""C1 eventually holds"" — true at S0 because C1 holds at S1.
- C3 = ""C2 holds or event1 happens"" — true at S0 (C2 is true).
- C4 = ""C3 does not hold"" — false at S0.
- C5 = ""C4 holds in the next state"" — evaluate C4 at S1: at S1 C3 is true (since event1 holds), so C4 is false at S1. Therefore C5 is false at S0.
- C6 = ""If C5 holds, then event1 happens"" — antecedent C5 is false, so the implication is vacuously true; C6 is true at S0.

Context summary:
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- After event1, event2 must happen.

From this, event1 does happen (specifically immediately after the initial event2), and in fact events alternate event2 → event1 → event2 → …

Evaluate the conditions:
- C1: Event1 does not happen. False (event1 does happen).
- C2: Event1 does not happen. False (same as C1).
- C3: C1 holds and C2 holds. False (both conjuncts are false).
- C4: C3 does not hold. True (since C3 is false).
- C5: Event1 does not happen. False (same as C1).
- C6: If C4 holds, then C5 holds. Since C4 is true but C5 is false, this implication is false.

Set up the timeline of states:
- s0 (initial): event1 true, event2 false.
- s1: after event1, event2 must happen → event2 true, event1 false.
- s2: after event2, event1 must happen → event1 true, event2 false.
- s3: event2 true, etc. So events alternate: event1 at even states, event2 at odd states.

Evaluate the Ci formulas at s0 (and note global truth where needed):

- C1: ""event1 and event1"" ≡ event1. True at s0 (and at s2, s4,...), false at s1, s3,...
- C2: ""C1 always holds"" = globally C1. This is false, because C1 fails at s1 (C1 is not true at all states).
- C3: ""C2 holds in the next state"" = next(C2). C2 is false in every state, so C3 is false at every state (in particular false at s0 because C2 is false at s1).
- C4: ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds"" = (event2 → C3). Since C3 is false everywhere, C4 is false at states where event2 is true (odd states) and true at states where event2 is false (even states). In particular C4 is false at s1.
- C5: ""C4 holds in the next state"" = next(C4). At s0, next state s1 has C4 false, so C5 is false at s0.
- C6: ""C5 holds and event1 happens"" = C5 ∧ event1. At s0 event1 is true but C5 is false, so C6 is false at s0. In fact C6 is false at every state (because whenever event1 is true C5 is false, and whenever C5 could be true event1 is false).
- C7: ""C6 holds in the next state"" = next(C6). Since C6 is false at every state, C7 is false at every state (in particular false at the initial state s0).

Reasoning step-by-step

1) Understand the context
- Time 0: event1 happens (initially).
- From any occurrence of event1, event2 must subsequently occur (event2 will happen at some later time).
- Once event2 has occurred, no further events can happen after that point.

2) Simplify the hypothesis conditions
- C1, C2, C5 are the same: “event1 happens in the next state.”
- C3 = C1 or C2 is therefore ""event1 happens in the next state.""
- C4 = C3 or event1 = ""event1 happens in the next state OR event1 happens now.""
- C6 = C4 or C5 = ""event1 now OR event1 next"" (since C5 is the next-state event1 again).
- C7 = always C6 = at every state, (event1 now OR event1 next).

So C7 asserts: at every time point, either event1 holds at that time or it holds in the immediate next state.

3) Produce a counterexample consistent with the context
- Let event1 occur at time 0 (satisfies ""initially event1"").
- Let event2 occur at time 2 (satisfies ""after event1, event2 must happen"" and still allows a delay).
- At time 1, no events happen (allowed by the context; nothing forbids silent states before event2).
- Check C6 at time 1: event1 now? No. event1 in next state (time 2)? No (time 2 has event2, not event1). So C6 is false at time 1.
- Therefore C7 (""always C6"") is false in this permitted trace.

Because such a trace is consistent with the context, C7 is not guaranteed to hold in all models of the context. Hence the correct answer is False."

- We must evaluate whether C6 is true or false given the context and the definitions C1–C6.

Given context (interpreted as the actual run)
- Initially, event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen → event2 does happen.
- After event2, no other events can happen (terminal).

Examine each condition
- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" In the actual run event2 does happen and event1 did happen earlier, so the implication is true. Thus C1 holds.
- C2: ""C1 does not hold."" Since C1 holds, C2 is false.
- C3: same as C2, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""Event1 happens and C3 holds."" Event1 happens (true) but C3 is false, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" Since C4 is false, C5 is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- At the initial moment (t0) event1 happened, so C1 (and C2 and C5, which are the same) is false at t0.
- C3 (""C2 eventually holds"") is true at t0 because at the next moment when event2 happens, event1 does not happen, so C2 holds at that future time.
- C4 = C1 and C3 is false at t0 because C1 is false.
- C6 = C4 or C5 is therefore false at t0 (both disjuncts false at t0).

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Initially event1 happened, so C1 (""event1 eventually happens"") is true in the initial state (it has already happened).
- After event1, no other events can happen, so in any later state there is no future occurrence of event1. Therefore C1 is not true in those later states.
- C2 is ""C1 always holds"" (G C1). Because C1 fails in later states, C2 is false.
- C3 is ""C2 always holds"" (G C2). Since C2 is already false, C3 is false.
- C4 is ""C3 holds in the next state"" (X C3). Because C3 is false, C4 is false.
- C5 is ""C4 does not hold"" (¬X C3). Since C4 is false, C5 is true.

- C2 = ""event2 eventually holds"". Since event2 happened initially, C2 is true (it holds immediately).
- C3 is again event2, so C3 is true in the initial state.
- C4 = (C2 → C3). Since C2 is true and C3 is true in the initial state, C4 holds.
- C5 = ""C4 always holds"". There are no further states after the initial one (the context says after event2 no other events can happen), so C4 holds at every reachable state (just the initial), hence C5 is true.
- C6 = ""C5 holds in the next state"". Because there is no next state after the initial (event2 makes the trace terminal), the next-state condition is false (X φ is false when there is no next state in standard LTL semantics).
- C7 = ""C6 does not hold"" is therefore true.

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context: initially event2 happened. Also, after event2 no other events can happen (and after event1 no other events can happen). So the system is in a terminal state after event2, and event1 does not occur now or in the future.

2. C1: ""Event2 happens or event1 happens."" True, because event2 happened.

3. C2: ""Event1 happens and C1 holds."" False, because event1 does not happen.

4. C3: same as C2, so False.

5. C4: ""C3 eventually holds."" C3 is always false and no further events can make it true, so C4 is False.

6. C5: ""C2 holds or C4 holds."" Both are false, so C5 is False.

- We must determine whether C7 (""C6 does not hold"") is true or false.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen. (So event2 ⇒ event1.)
- After event1, event2 must happen. (So event1 ⇒ event2.)

From the last statement we directly get that ""if event1 happens, then event2 happens"" is true.

Step 3 — examine each condition
- C1: If event1 happens, then event2 happens. Given the context, C1 is true.
- C2: Same as C1, so C2 is true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" C2 is a general rule derived from the context, so C3 is at least true or redundant; in any case it doesn’t negate C1.
- C4: Same as C1/C2, so C4 is true whenever those hold.
- C5: If C3 holds, then C4 holds. With C3 true, C5 implies C4, which is consistent (C4 is true).
- C6: C1 holds or C5 holds. Since C1 is true, C6 is true regardless of C5.
- C7: C6 does not hold. But we just established C6 does hold.

Step 4 — conclusion
- C6 holds, therefore C7 (""C6 does not hold"") is false.

- After event1, no other events can happen. (If event1 were to occur, it would also stop further events.)

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Given the context, event2 already happened initially and after event2 no other events can happen, so event1 cannot occur at any time. Therefore C1 is false.
- C2: ""C1 holds and event2 happens."" C1 is false (above), though event2 did happen. The conjunction is false, so C2 is false.
- C3: same as C2, so C3 is false.
- C4: ""If C2 holds, then C3 holds."" Since C2 and C3 are identical, the implication is true; more generally an implication with a false antecedent is true, so C4 is true.

- C2: ""If C1 holds, then event1 happens."" Since C1 is true, C2 asserts that event1 happens. But because event2 happened and no other events can happen after event2, event1 cannot occur (there is no indication it occurred before). Therefore C2 is false.
- C3: ""C2 always holds."" Because C2 is false, C3 is false.

- C5: “If C2 holds, then C4 holds.” At any state, C2 is false, so the implication C2 → C4 is true (false implies anything).
- C6: “C5 always holds.” Since C5 is true at every state (because C2 is false everywhere), C6 is true.

Reasoning step-by-step:

- Context: initially event2 happened. The rule “after event2, no other events can happen” means in the next state no events (so in particular event1 cannot occur). The rule “after event1, event2 must happen” is a conditional that only matters if event1 occurs.

- C1: “If event1 happens, then event2 happens.” In any state where event1 cannot occur, this implication is vacuously true. So C1 is true in the next state.

- C2: “C1 holds in the next state.” As just argued, this is true.

- C3 and C4: each says “C2 does not hold.” Since C2 does hold, C3 and C4 are both false.

- C5: “C3 holds or C4 holds.” Since both C3 and C4 are false, their disjunction is false.

Therefore C5 is False."

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context we get these temporal facts:
   - Initially event2 is true (state 0: E2).
   - After event2, event1 must happen (so in the next state after any E2, E1 holds).
   - After event1, event2 must happen (so in the next state after any E1, E2 holds).
   Together these force strict alternation: state0 E2, state1 E1, state2 E2, state3 E1, ….

2. Evaluate the conditions (interpreting ""always"" as globally G and ""in the next state"" as X):
   - C1: ""Event2 always happens"" = G(E2). This is false, because E2 is false in the states where E1 holds.
   - C2: same as C1, so also false.
   - C3: ""Event1 happens and C2 holds"" = E1 ∧ C2. Since C2 is false, C3 is false in every state.
   - C4: ""C3 does not hold"" = ¬C3. This is true (everywhere).
   - C5: ""C1 holds and C4 holds"" = C1 ∧ C4. C1 is false, so C5 is false.
   - C6: ""C5 holds in the next state"" = X C5. Since C5 is false in every state, C6 is false.
   - C7: ""C6 always holds"" = G C6. Because C6 is false, C7 is false.

- Initially, event2 happened. That makes ""event2 happened"" true at the start.
- After event2, event1 must happen → event1 will occur later in the run.
- After event1, no other events can happen → the run ends after event1.

Key semantic assumption (consistent with the wording “happened”): once an event has happened, the proposition “eventX happened” stays true for all later times (i.e., occurrences are persistent facts about the history).

Step 2 — examine each condition
- C1: “Event2 happens and event2 happens.” This is just a tautological repetition; it is true at the start because event2 happened.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 is true at the start.
- C3: “C2 always holds.” Since C2 is a statement that event2 happened and a past occurrence remains true for the rest of the run, C2 is true at every time, so C3 is true.
- C4: “C1 holds and C3 holds.” Both parts are true, so C4 is true (and remains true).
- C5: “C4 always holds.” Because C4 is built from persistent truths, it holds at every time, so C5 is true.
- C6: “C5 always holds.” Same reasoning — true.
- C7: “C6 always holds.” True as well.

- Initially event1 occurred. Because after event1 no other events can happen, event2 does not occur.
- C1 is ""event1 → event2"". At the initial moment event1 is true and event2 is false, so C1 is false.
- C2 (""C1 always holds"") is false because C1 is already false at the initial moment.

Context summary
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, no other events can happen.
- (Also after event2 no other events can happen, but that is irrelevant because event2 never occurs here.)

Because after event1 no other events can happen and event1 happened initially, event2 never occurs.

Evaluate conditions
- C1 (event2 eventually happens): False (event2 cannot occur).
- C2 (event2 eventually happens): False (same as C1).
- C3 (C1 and C2): False (conjunction of two false statements).
- C4 (C3 holds in the next state): False (C3 is false; even if there is no next state, C4 cannot be true).
- C5 (event2 eventually happens): False (same as C1).
- C6 (if event2 happens, then C5 holds): True (implication is vacuously true because event2 never happens).

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Initially event1 happened, and the rules ""after event1, event2 must happen"" and ""after event2, event1 must happen"" imply event2 will occur at some later time.
- C1 and C2 are the same: ""event1 happens or event2 happens"". Because event1 happens initially (and event2 happens later), C1 (and C2) are true.
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" Whenever event2 happens the disjunction C2 is true (it contains event2), and if event2 does not happen the implication is vacuously true. So C3 always holds.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" This is true (from the previous point).
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" This is false because C4 does hold.
- C6: ""C5 holds and event2 happens."" This is false because C5 is false (the conjunction is false even though event2 does happen).
- C7: ""If C1 holds, then C6 holds."" C1 is true but C6 is false, so the implication is false.

Therefore C7 is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context: event2 occurs initially; then event1 must occur sometime after; after event1 no further events can occur. So the timeline is: time0: event2; time1: event1; thereafter: no events.

- C1 and C2 are the same tautological-looking claim ""event2 happens"", so they are true at the initial time (time0) because event2 did happen then.

- C3 is ""C2 always holds"" (globally). That would require event2 to hold at every moment after the point of evaluation. But event2 only holds at time0 and does not hold at time1 (event1) or later. Thus C3 is false.

- C4 is ""C3 always holds"", so it is also false. C5 = C1 and C4 is false because C4 is false. C6 = ""C5 always holds"" is false. 

- C7 = ""eventually C6 holds"" would require some future time at which C6 is true. But C6 can never become true (it asserts a global property C5 that is already false and cannot become universally true later), so C7 is false.

Therefore the hypothesis C7 is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):

1. From the context: initially event1 happened, and the rules force event2 to happen after event1 (and then event1 after event2). So event2 does occur (indeed it must occur).

2. C1 and C2 both assert ""Event2 does not happen."" Those are therefore false given the context.

3. C3 is ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" That requires C2 true and event2 true simultaneously — impossible because C2 is false. So C3 is false.

4. C4 is ""C3 always holds."" Since C3 is already false, C4 is false.

5. C5 is ""C1 holds and C4 holds."" Both conjuncts are false, so C5 is false.

6. C6 is ""C5 holds in the next state."" Since C5 is false now (and there is no way to make C5 true given the above), C6 is false.

7. C7 is ""C6 always holds."" C6 is false, so C7 is false.

Therefore C7 is False."

Step 2 — examine the context
- Initially event2 happens.
- After event2, event1 must happen → event1 occurs (after the initial event2).
- After event1, event2 must happen → the events alternate, so event1 occurs (in fact repeatedly).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This is just a repetition, so C1 is true (event1 does occur).
- C2: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" Since C1 is true and event1 happens, C2 is true.

- Hence event1 does not happen (it cannot occur at any time).

- C2: Event1 does not happen. True (same as C1).
- C3: C2 eventually holds. Since C2 is already true, C3 is true.

- C5: Event1 does not happen. True (same as C1/C2).
- C6: C4 holds and C5 holds. That is False (C4 is false, so the conjunction is false).

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

- Context: at the initial state (call it state0) event2 is true. By the context, events alternate: after an event2 there will be event1 next, and after event1 there will be event2 next.

- C1: ""If event2 happens, then event1 happens."" Whether this is read as a next/eventual implication or a state implication, it doesn't matter for the rest because of C2.

- C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" At state0 event2 happens, so C2 is true at state0.

- C3: ""C2 eventually holds."" Since C2 already holds at state0, C3 is true at state0.

- C4: ""C3 holds and event2 happens."" At state0 both parts are true (C3 true, event2 true), so C4 is true at state0.

- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" Since C4 is true at state0, C5 is false at state0.

- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" Look at state1 (the next state): event1 occurs in state1 (events alternate), and event2 does not hold there. Re-evaluate C4 in state1: C4 = C3 ∧ event2; event2 is false in state1 so C4 is false in state1, hence C5 (""C4 does not hold"") is true in state1. Therefore C6 (which says C5 holds in the next state) is true at state0.

- C7: ""C6 does not hold."" We just found C6 is true at state0, so C7 is false.

Thus C7 is False."

Timeline from the context:

Evaluate the conditions at s0:

2. C2: ""C1 holds or event2 happens."" At s0 this is true (`C1` is true).

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

- From the context: initially event2 happened, and the rules “after event2, event1 must happen” and “after event1, event2 must happen” force an infinite alternation event2 → event1 → event2 → event1 → … .

- C1 = “event2 does not happen.” That is false in states where event2 occurs, and true in states where event1 occurs.

- C2 = “C1 eventually holds” (i.e. eventually ¬event2). True: after an event2 there is an event1 state where ¬event2 holds.

- C3 = “C2 always holds” (i.e. from every state, eventually ¬event2). True: because of the alternation, from any state there is a future state with ¬event2 (indeed every other state).

- C4 = “C3 holds in the next state.” True: the alternation is the same at every step, so C3 holds at the next state as well.

- C5 = “C4 does not hold.” This contradicts C4, so C5 is false.

- C6 = “C5 always holds.” False, because C5 is already false (so it cannot hold at all states).

- C7 = “C6 eventually holds.” Since C6 never holds in any state, C7 is false.

Therefore C7 is False."

Setup (discrete states t0, t1, ...):

C7 asserts: ""Event2 happens and C6 holds."" We must decide whether that conjunction is true given the context and the other Ci.

Step 2 — interpret the context
- Initially event2 happened (so event2 is true at the start).
- After event2, event1 must happen (so event1 will occur after that).
- After event1, event2 must happen (so event2 will occur after that).
Thus events alternate (event2 → event1 → event2 → ...), so event2 does indeed happen (both initially and repeatedly).

Step 3 — evaluate the Ci facts
- C1: ""If event1 happens, then event2 happens."" This matches the context rule, so C1 holds.
- C2: same as C1, so C2 holds.
- C3: ""If C1 holds, then C2 holds."" Since C1 does hold and C2 is identical to C1, C3 holds.
- C4: ""C3 always holds."" Given C3 is a valid logical implication between fixed predicates/rules, C4 holds.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold."" This contradicts C4, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 eventually holds."" Since C5 is false and C4 holds always (so C5 cannot become true later), C6 is false.

Step 4 — conclude about C7
C7 requires both (1) event2 happens — true — and (2) C6 holds — false. The conjunction is therefore false.

Reasoning:
- Initially event2 holds.
- The context says after event2 no other events can happen, so event1 cannot occur in any state (unless it happened simultaneously initially, but the context gives only event2 initially).
- C1 and C2 are tautologies (event2 → event2), so they hold but add nothing useful.
- C3 requires event1 to hold (event1 ∧ C2). Since event1 never occurs, C3 is false.
- C4 = C1 ∧ C3 is therefore false. C5 = “C4 holds in the next state” is false.
- C6 = (event1) ∨ (C5) is false in every state (neither disjunct ever holds).
- C7 = “C6 eventually holds” is therefore false.

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. What is being asked: C6 asserts that C5 always holds. So we must check whether C5 (which depends on C2 and C4) is true in every state given the context.

2. Context summary:
   - Initially event2 happened.
   - After event1, event2 must happen (so event1 implies a later event2).
   - After event2, no other events can happen (once event2 has happened, there are no further events).

3. Examine the conditions:
   - C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens"" — requires a state where both event2 and event1 hold.
   - C2 and C3: C1 holds in the next state (they assert C1 at the successor state).
   - C4: C3 eventually holds (so C3 must be true at some future state).
   - C5: C2 and C4 hold.
   - C6: C5 always holds (holds in every state).

4. Trace the event possibilities:
   - Since event2 happened initially, we are at or after the point where event2 has occurred.
   - The rule ""after event2, no other events can happen"" forbids event1 from occurring in any state after that initial event2.
   - Therefore there is no state after the initial event2 in which event1 occurs; the only potential state where both event2 and event1 could hold is the initial state, but the context only guarantees event2 initially — it does not state event1 also happened initially.
   - Hence there is no guaranteed state where both event2 and event1 hold. So C1 never holds (under the given constraints).

5. Consequences:
   - If C1 never holds, then C2 and C3 are false, C4 is false, C5 is false, and therefore C6 (""C5 always holds"") is false.

Conclusion: C6 is False."

Model the timeline:
- At time 0 (initial): event1 happened.
- The statement ""after event1, no other events can happen"" means for all times t ≥ 1 no event occurs (so event2 never occurs at any t ≥ 1, and event1 only held at t = 0).
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 never occurs.

Now evaluate the conditions (all evaluated from time 0):

1. C1 = X event2: this requires event2 at time 1. But event2 never occurs, so C1 is false at time 0 (and in fact false at every time).
2. C2 = F C1 (eventually C1): since C1 is false at every time, there is no future time where C1 is true, so C2 is false.
3. C3 = F C2: same reasoning, C2 is false everywhere, so C3 is false.
4. C4 = F C3: false.
5. C5 = G C4 (always C4): since C4 is false already at time 0, G C4 is false.
6. C6 = G C5: false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the context, events must alternate starting with event2 at the initial state: t0: event2, t1: event1, t2: event2, ...
- C1: ""event1 does not happen"" — true at t0 (event1 happens first at t1).
- C2: C1 ∧ event2 — true at t0 (C1 true and event2 happens at t0).
- C3: C2 ∨ event2 — true at t0.
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state"" = X C3. At t0 this requires C3 at t1. At t1 event1 happens and event2 does not, and C2 is false at t1 (because C1 is false at t1), so C3 is false at t1. Thus C4 is false at t0.
- C5: ""C4 does not hold"" — true at t0 (negation of C4).
- C6: ""C5 always holds"" — false, because at t1 C4 holds (since C3 holds at t2 where event2 happens), so C5 is false at t1; therefore C5 is not true at all times.
- C7: ""C6 holds or event1 happens"" — at the initial state t0, event1 does not happen and C6 is false, so C7 is false.

Therefore C7 is False."

Reasoning step-by-step:
- From the context: event2 happens initially, and that forces event1 to happen afterwards. So both event2 and event1 do happen. Therefore C1 (""Event2 happens and event1 happens"") is True.
- C2 (""If C1 holds, then event1 happens"") is true, because C1 already asserts event1; the implication holds.
- C5 is the same as C2, so C5 is also True.
- C3 (""C2 always holds"") is true as a statement here: C2 is logically valid (it follows from the content of C1), so C3 holds.
- C4 (""C3 does not hold"") contradicts C3, so C4 is False.
- C6 is the conjunction ""C4 holds and C5 holds"". Since C4 is False (even though C5 is True), the conjunction C6 is False.

Thus C6 is False."

- We must decide whether C7 is True or False given the context (initial e2, then e1, then e2, … alternating forever).

Step 2 — simplify the conditions
- C1: ""event2 and event2"" ≡ event2.
- C2: not C1 ≡ not event2.
- C3: not C2 ≡ not(not event2) ≡ event2. So C3 ≡ C1 ≡ event2.
- C4: event2 and C3 ≡ event2 and event2 ≡ event2. So C4 ≡ event2.
- C5: always C4 ≡ always event2 (i.e. event2 holds at every time).
- C6: eventually C5 ≡ eventually (always event2) — there is some time after which event2 holds at every time.
- C7: eventually C6 ≡ eventually (eventually (always event2)) — equivalent to eventually (always event2).

Step 3 — use the context
- The context forces an infinite alternation: event2 at time 0, event1 at time 1, event2 at time 2, etc. Thus event2 does not hold at every time, and there is no time after which event2 holds at every subsequent time (event1 keeps occurring).

Step 4 — conclusion
- Therefore ""always event2"" is false, ""eventually always event2"" is false at every time, and so C7 is False.

Reasoning step-by-step:

1. From the context:
   - Initially event1 has happened.
   - After event1, no other events can happen. Since event1 has already happened initially, no other events can ever happen afterwards. Therefore event2 can never occur.
   - (The extra rule “after event2, event1 must happen” is irrelevant because event2 never occurs.)

1) Understand the context:
- Initial state (time 0): event2 happened, event1 did not.
- After any state where event2 happens, event1 must happen in the next state.
- After any state where event1 happens, event2 must happen in the next state.
Thus the timeline alternates: t0: event2, t1: event1, t2: event2, t3: event1, ... No state has both events true simultaneously.

2) Evaluate the conditions on each time step:
- C1: event1 and event2 both hold in the same state. This is never true (events alternate), so C1 is false at every time.
- C2: (event2 -> C1). Where event2 is true (t0, t2, ...), C1 is false, so the implication is false at those times. Where event2 is false (t1, t3, ...), the implication is true. So C2 is false at even times and true at odd times.
- C3: next(C2). Thus C3 is true at times that precede an odd time, i.e. true at even times, false at odd times.
- C4: same as C2 (given), so same truth pattern: false at even times, true at odd times.
- C5: C3 and C4. At every time either C3 or C4 is false (they have opposite truth patterns), so C5 is false at every time.
- C6: next(C5). Since C5 is false at every time, next(C5) is false at every time as well.

Step 2 — interpret the context:
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 does happen (already true).
- After event1, event2 must happen. So event2 will occur sometime after event1.
- After event2, no other events can happen. So the sequence is event1 then event2, and nothing after event2.

C7 asserts that C6 ""always holds"" (i.e., in every state). We must decide if that is true given the context.

Step 2 — interpret the context and the C-conditions
- Context: initially event2 occurred. After any event1, event2 must happen next. After any event2, event1 must happen next. So events alternate forever: ... event2 (initial), then event1, then event2, then event1, ...
- C1, C2, C4: each says ""Event1 happens in the next state."" At the initial state (where event2 just happened) that is true.
- C3: ""C2 always holds"" — i.e., in every state C2 is true (every state’s next state has event1).
- C5: C3 or C4.
- C6: C1 or C5.
- C7: C6 always holds.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- At the initial state: C1, C2, C4 are true (next state is event1). C3 is false because C2 is not true in every state (in states immediately after event1, the next state is event2, so C2 is false there). Thus C5 = (false or true) = true, and C6 = (true or true) = true.
- But C7 requires C6 to hold in every state. Consider a state immediately after event1 (i.e., a state where the current event is event1). In that state:
  - ""Event1 happens in the next state"" is false (next is event2), so C1, C2, C4 are false there.
  - C3 (""C2 always holds"") is false as argued above.
  - Thus C5 = false, and C6 = false in that state.

Because there exists a reachable state where C6 is false, C6 is not always true; therefore C7 is false.

- We must determine whether C7 (""C6 does not hold"") is true or false in the given scenario (starting from the initial state).

Understand the context and state sequence:
- Initially (call this state s0) event1 happened.
- After event1 must come event2, and after event2 must come event1. So states alternate events:
  - s0: event1
  - s1: event2
  - s2: event1
  - s3: event2
  - ... and so on.

Evaluate the conditions step by step (at an arbitrary state s_k; we need the value at the initial state s0, but the pattern is periodic):

1. C1: ""Event1 happens in the next state.""
   - C1 is true at states where the next state has event1.
   - Because events alternate, C1 is true exactly at odd-numbered states (where the next state is even and has event1), and false at even-numbered states.
   - In particular at s0 (even), C1 is false.

2. C2: ""C1 holds in the next state."" (i.e., at s_{k+1}, C1 is true)
   - C2 is true exactly at even-numbered states (because then s_{k+1} is odd and C1 is true there).
   - At s0, C2 is true.

3. C3: ""C2 does not hold.""
   - C3 is the negation of C2, so C3 is true exactly at odd-numbered states and false at even-numbered states.
   - At s0, C3 is false.

4. C4: ""C3 always holds.""
   - C3 does not hold at all states (it alternates), so ""C3 always holds"" is false at every state.
   - Thus C4 is false everywhere (including s0).

5. C5: ""C4 does not hold.""
   - Since C4 is false everywhere, C5 is true everywhere (including s0).

6. C6: ""C5 holds in the next state.""
   - C5 is true at every state, so C6 is true at every state (including s0).

7. C7: ""C6 does not hold.""
   - C6 is true everywhere, so C7 is false everywhere (including s0).

- C3: ""C1 holds and event1 happens."" (identical to C2)

Step 3 — check against the event rules
- The context says initially event1 happened and ""after event1, no other events can happen,"" so event1 cannot occur in the next state; thus C1 is false, hence C2 and C3 are false in any state. A false antecedent makes C4 true as well. That reinforces that C5 holds.

Reasoning (step-by-step):

- From the context we get an infinite alternation starting at the initial state s0:
  s0: event2, s1: event1, s2: event2, s3: event1, ...

- C1 is simply ""event2"" (since ""event2 or event2"" is equivalent to event2). So C1 holds in states s0, s2, s4, ...

- C2 / C5: ""C1 holds in the next state"" — at a state t this means event2 holds at t+1. At s0 this is false because s1 has event1, not event2.

- C3: ""C2 eventually holds"" — yes: for example at s1, the next state s2 has event2, so C2 holds at s1; thus C3 is true at s0 (there is a future state where C2 holds).

- C4: ""If event2 happens, then C3 holds."" At s0 event2 happens and C3 holds, so C4 is true at s0.

- C6: ""If C4 holds, then C5 holds."" At s0 C4 is true but C5 is false (as noted), so the implication C6 is false at s0.

Therefore C6 is False."

- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, event1 must happen → event1 happens.
- After event1, event2 must happen → event2 happens again.
Thus both event2 and event1 do happen (in fact they alternate), so the proposition ""event2 happens and event1 happens"" is true.

Step 2 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event2 happens and event1 happens."" True (from the context).
- C2: same as C1. True.
- C3: ""If C2 holds, then event1 happens."" C2 is true and event1 happens, so the implication is true.
- C4: ""C1 holds or C3 holds."" Both C1 and C3 are true, so C4 is true.

Reasoning step by step:

- Context gives: initially event1 happened. Also, after event1 no other events can happen, so event2 never occurs in any future state.

- C1 and C2 both assert ""Event1 does not happen."" That contradicts the context (event1 did happen initially), so C1 and C2 are false in the initial state.

- C3 is ""Event2 happens or C2 holds."" Since C2 is false and event2 never happens, C3 is false.

- C4 is ""C3 holds in the next state."" C3 is false (and there are no states where event2 happens), so C4 is false.

- C5 is ""C1 holds or C4 holds."" Both are false, so C5 is false.

- C6 is ""C5 eventually holds."" Since C5 is false now and remains false in all future states, C6 is false.

- C7 is ""C6 always holds."" C6 is false, so C7 is false.

Therefore C7 is False."

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- From the context: event2 happened, and after event2 event1 must happen. So event1 is true.
- C1 (event1 does not happen) is therefore false. C5 is the same and also false.
- C2 is ""if event2 happens then C1"", i.e. E2 → ¬E1. With E2 true and ¬E1 false, C2 is false.
- C3 is ""if C2 holds then event1 happens"" (C2 → E1). Since C2 is false, C3 is true (a false antecedent makes the implication true).
- C4 = C3 ∨ E1 is true (both disjuncts are true).
- C6 = C4 ∨ C5 is true (true ∨ false = true).

We must determine whether C7 (""C6 eventually holds"") is true or false, given the context and the listed conditions.

Step 2 — use the context
- Initially, event1 happened. So event1 has already occurred.
- After event1, no other events can happen. So once event1 has occurred (which it has initially), no event2 (or any other event) can occur afterward.
- ""After event2, event1 must happen"" is irrelevant here because event2 cannot occur (due to the previous rule).

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: Event1 eventually happens. True (it already happened initially).
- C2: Event1 eventually happens. True (same as C1).
- C3: If C2 holds, then event2 happens. Since C2 does hold, C3 requires that event2 happens. But event2 cannot happen (no events can occur after the initial event1), so C3 is false.
- C4: C1 holds and C3 holds. C1 is true but C3 is false, so C4 is false.
- C5: C4 holds in the next state. C4 is false now and, because event2 can never occur and C3 will therefore remain false, C4 cannot become true in the next state; C5 is false.
- C6: Event2 happens or C5 holds. Both disjuncts are false, so C6 is false.
- C7: Eventually C6 holds. Since neither event2 nor C5 can ever become true (event2 is impossible after the initial event1), C6 will never hold, so C7 is false.

- C1: ""Event2 happens or event2 happens"" is equivalent to ""event2 happens."" That is true because event2 happened initially.

- C7 is the conjunction ""C1 holds and C6 holds"". We must determine whether C7 is true given the context.

Step 2 — facts from the context
- Initially event2 happened.
- After event2, no other events can happen (so once event2 has occurred, no event1 can occur at any later point).
- Also given: ""After event1, event2 must happen"" (not needed for the core contradiction below).

Step 3 — evaluate the Ci facts
- C1: ""Event1 eventually happens."" Given that event2 already happened initially and no events can occur after event2, event1 cannot occur later. (If one allowed event1 to also hold simultaneously with the initial event2, that would be an explicit extra assumption; the plain reading is event2 is true initially and blocks any further events.) So C1 is false.
- C2: same as C1, false.
- C3: ""C2 holds and event2 happens."" Since C2 is false, C3 is false (even though event2 does happen initially).
- C4: ""C3 holds in the next state."" C3 is false, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 always holds."" C4 is not true, so C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" C5 is false, so C6 is false.

Step 4 — conclude C7
- C7 = C1 and C6. Both C1 and C6 are false, so C7 is false.

- From the context: event1 holds at the initial state; thereafter no events occur, so event2 never holds in any state.

Context implies:
- event1 happened initially.
- After event1, event2 must happen → event2 happens.
- After event2, no other events can happen (no contradiction with above).

So event1 and event2 both happen.

Evaluate conditions:
- C1: event1 and event2 happen — True.
- C2: event2 happens or C1 holds — event2 happens, so True.
- C3: event1 and event2 happen — True.
- C4: event1 and event2 happen — True.
- C5: If C3 then C4 — since C3 is True and C4 is True, the implication is True.
- C6: event2 happens and C5 holds — both True, so C6 is True.
- C7: C2 or C6 — at least one (in fact both) is True, so C7 is True.

Reasoning (step‑by‑step):

- From the context: initially event1 occurs, and the two rules force alternation (after event1 comes event2, after event2 comes event1). So event1 occurs at times 0,2,4,... and thus from any state “event1 eventually happens” is true.
- C1 and C2 are both “event1 eventually happens” → true (indeed true at every state).
- C3: “If event2 happens, then C2 holds.” C2 is true everywhere, so C3 is true.
- C4: “C3 does not hold.” Since C3 holds, C4 is false (everywhere).
- C5: “C4 eventually holds.” Because C4 never holds, C5 is false.
- C6: “C1 holds and C5 holds.” C1 is true but C5 is false, so C6 is false.
- C7: “C6 holds in the next state.” C6 is false in every state, so C7 is false.

Therefore C7 is False."

Understanding the context
- Initially event1 happened.
- After event1, event2 must happen.
- After event2, event1 must happen.
- That implies an alternating sequence: event1 → event2 → event1 → event2 … so event2 does occur (indeed repeatedly).

Examine the conditions
- C1: Event2 always happens. Given the context, event2 does occur (and recurs), so treat C1 as true.
- C2: C1 holds or event2 happens. Since C1 is true (and event2 also happens), C2 is true.
- C3: Event2 always happens. Same as C1, so C3 is true.
- C4: C2 holds or C3 holds. Both C2 and C3 are true, so C4 is true.
- C5: C4 does not hold. But C4 does hold, so C5 is false.
- C6: Event2 always happens. Same as C1/C3, so C6 is true.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
1. The question: is C6 true given the context?
2. From the context: initially event2 happened, and after event2 no other events can happen. So event1 cannot happen at any time (there are no further events after the initial event2).
3. C1 (""Event1 always happens"") is therefore false.
4. C2 and C3 both assert ""C1 holds in the next state"" — since C1 is false, C2 and C3 are false. C4 is ""C3 does not hold"", so C4 is true.
5. C5 is ""C2 holds and C4 holds"". That requires C2 true and C4 true, but C2 is false, so C5 is false. (Also C2 and C3 are the same statement, so C5 would require a statement and the negation of that same statement, which is impossible.)
6. C6 is ""C5 holds and event1 happens"". C5 is false and event1 does not happen, so C6 is false.

We must determine whether C6 is true or false given the context and the listed conditions. C6 is ""C2 holds and C5 holds.""

Step 2 — interpret the context and basic facts
- Initially event1 happened — so ""event1 happens"" is true (at least at that initial moment).
- After event1, event2 must happen; after event2, event1 must happen — so events alternate. Event1 does not hold at all times (there are moments when event2 occurs).

Step 3 — evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event1 happens and event1 happens."" This just restates that event1 happens; given the initial event1, C1 is true (at that time).
- C2: ""C1 always holds."" That would mean event1 holds at all times. Because events alternate (event2 occurs after event1), C1 is not true at all times → C2 is false.
- C3: same as C2 (""C1 always holds"") → C3 is false.
- C4: same as C1 (""Event1 happens and event1 happens"") → true (as C1).
- C5: ""C3 holds or C4 holds."" C3 is false, C4 is true → C5 is true.
- C6: ""C2 holds and C5 holds."" C2 is false, C5 is true → the conjunction is false.

Reasoning (step-by-step):
- Interpret time starting at the initial state t0 where event2 happened.
- The rules imply alternation: after event2 there will be an event1, and after event1 there will be an event2. So event1 occurs at t1, t3, ... (and event2 at t0, t2, ...).
- C1 and C2 are both equivalent to ""event1 happens"" at the current state. At t0 they are false, but at t1 they are true.
- C3 = C1 and C2 is therefore equivalent to ""event1 holds""; it is eventually true (at t1).
- C4 = ""C3 eventually holds"" is true at t0 because event1 occurs at t1.
- C5 = ""C4 holds in the next state"" is true at t0 because at t1 C4 still holds (C3 already holds at t1).
- C6 = ""Event1 happens or C5 holds"" is true at t0 because C5 is true.
- C7 = ""C6 does not hold"" is therefore false.

- C6 says “C5 always holds.” We must decide if that is true given the context.

- Initially, event2 happened. So event2 occurs at the start.

- After event1, event2 must happen — if event1 ever occurs then event2 must occur afterwards.

Step 3 — evaluate the conditions
- C1: Event2 always happens. True, because event2 already happened initially (and no alternate trace without that is allowed by the context).
- C2: Event2 happens or C1 holds. True (both disjuncts are true).

C7 asserts ""C6 holds in the next state"". We must decide whether that is true given the context.

Step 2 — simplify the Ci formulas
- C1 = event1 and event1, so C1 ⇔ event1.
- C2 = C1 and event1 ⇔ event1.
- Repeating this, C3, C4, C5 all are equivalent to event1.
- C6 = event1 or C5 ⇔ event1.
Hence C6 is equivalent to ""event1 happens"". Therefore C7 is equivalent to ""event1 happens in the next state"".

Step 3 — use the context to evaluate C7
- Initially (current state) event1 happened.
- The context rule ""After event1, event2 must happen"" requires that the next state after an event1 state has event2 (not event1).
Thus in the next state event1 does not hold (it has event2 instead), so C7 is false.

False"

- Initially event1 has occurred, and after event1 no other events can happen. Since event1 is true at the initial state and no events can occur after it, event2 can never occur in any future state.

</graphml>",0.0,"You are asking whether C7 is true given the context. I'll go step by step through the conditions and the event sequences and then give the final answer.

1) What is being asked
- Determine whether C7 (""C6 always holds"") is true under the given assumptions about events.

2) Context and consequences
- Initially, event2 happened (so event2 is true in the initial state).
- After event2, no other events can happen (the run is terminal after event2).
- After event1, no other events can happen (if event1 were to occur, the run would also be terminal).

3) Evaluate each condition
- C1: ""Event1 always happens."" Given event2 already happened initially and no further events can occur, event1 does not (and cannot) occur. So C1 is false.
- C2: Same as C1 (""Event1 always happens""). So C2 is false.
- C3: ""If event2 happens, then C2 holds."" The antecedent (event2 happens) is true (it happened initially), but the consequent C2 is false, so the implication is false. Thus C3 is false.
- C4: ""C1 holds or C3 holds."" Both disjuncts are false, so C4 is false.
- C5: ""C4 eventually holds."" Since the system is terminal after the initial event2 and C4 is false now and will remain false, C4 never becomes true, so ""eventually C4"" is false. Thus C5 is false.
- C6: ""C5 holds in the next state."" There is no next state where anything changes (the run is terminal), and C5 is false, so C6 is false.
- C7: ""C6 always holds."" Since C6 is false, C7 is false.

4) Conclusion
- C7 is False.

Final answer:
False"
